The main novelties are the introduction of a set of specific dependency patterns and the introduction of a partially revised TRIZ (Russian acronym for “Theory of Inventive Problem Solving”) ontology to classify the retrieved information. The proposed dependency patterns were manually extracted from a sample patents pool about waste recycling and reuse. The classification of the information is based on different classes: (1) what transformations can be carried out on the waste, (2) what technologies can be used to carry out these transformations, (3) what products can be obtained by transforming the waste, (4) what functions can be carried out by the waste, (5) with which technologies, and (6) on which entities. An automatic implementation of the proposed method, involving the manual check of the retrieved results, was tested through a case study about wood chip recycling and reuse. Compared to the dependency patterns from the literature, the proposed ones allowed to retrieve 28 % more pertinent information. This results mainly depends by better ability of the proposed patterns to better discriminate the relevant sentences from which to extract information, compared to the other patterns (i.e. + 40 %). The automatic classification of the information was also correctly performed: in almost each class, precision and recall were higher than 60 % and on average equal to 90 %. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Dependency patterns; Patents; Text mining","Patents and inventions; Recycling; Text mining; Wood products; Automatic classification; Automatic implementation; Circular economy; Different class; Extract informations; Precision and recall; Theory of inventive problem solving; Waste recycling; Classification (of information)",Article,Scopus

There exist several cell classification ontologies with complementary information. However, one needs to merge them to synergistically combine their information. The main difficulty in merging is to match the ontologies since they use different naming conventions. Therefore, we developed an algorithm that merges ontologies by integrating the name matching between class label names with the structure mapping between the ontology elements based on graph convolution. Since the structure mapping is a time consuming process, we designed two methods to perform the graph convolution: vectorial structure matching and constraint-based structure matching. To perform the vectorial structure matching, we designed a general method to calculate the similarities between vectors of different lengths for different metrics. Additionally, we adapted the slower Blondel method to work for structure matching. We implemented our algorithms into FOntCell, a software module in Python for efficient automatic parallel-computed merging/fusion of ontologies in the same or similar knowledge domains. FOntCell can unify dispersed knowledge from one domain into a unique ontology in OWL format and iteratively reuse it to continuously adapt ontologies with new data endlessly produced by data-driven classification methods, such as of the Human Cell Atlas. To navigate easily across the merged ontologies, it generates HTML files with tabulated and graphic summaries, and interactive circular Directed Acyclic Graphs. We used FOntCell to merge the CELDA, LifeMap and LungMAP Human Anatomy cell ontologies into a comprehensive cell ontology. We compared FOntCell with tools used for the alignment of mouse and human anatomy ontologies task proposed by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) and found that the Fβ alignment accuracies of FOntCell are above the geometric mean of the other tools; more importantly, it outperforms significantly the best OAEI tools in cell ontology alignment in terms of Fβ alignment accuracies. © Copyright © 2021 Cabau-Laporta, Ascensión, Arrospide-Elgarresta, Gerovska and Araúzo-Bravo.","automatic ontology merging; cell ontology; Human Cell Atlas (HCA); ontology alignment; Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI); ontology merging","algorithm; animal cell; animal experiment; article; controlled study; directed acyclic graph; human; male; mouse; nonhuman; ontology; software",Article,Scopus

"Eray E., Sanchez B., Haas C.","Usage of interface management system in adaptive reuse of buildings",2019,"Buildings","10.3390/buildings9050105","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071694534&doi=10.3390%2fbuildings9050105&partnerID=40&md5=5d8be821c28ae1614156969f64cf1a69","Adaptive reuse of buildings is considered a superior alternative for new construction in terms of sustainability and a disruptive practice in the current capital project delivery model for the renewal of today's built environment. In comparison to green-field construction projects, adaptive reuse projects require distinct stages, definition of interfaces, decision gates, and planning methods in order to secure the success of the building project. Unfortunately, little research has been done regarding establishing feasible systems for the planning, assessment, and management of adaptive reuse projects, leading to underperforming building projects outcomes. Interface management (IM) can improve renovation projects outcomes by defining appropriate ways to identify, record, monitor, and track project interfaces. IM has the potential of bringing cost and time benefits during adaptive reuse projects execution. The aim of this study is to develop a reference framework for implementing IM for adaptive reuse projects. First, the inefficiencies of redevelopment projects are explained inside of a circular economy (CE) context. Second, an ontology of IM for adaptive reuse projects is defined based on the current barriers to adaptive reuse and the most common interface problems in construction projects. Third, the defined ontology is expanded through a case study by showing examples of adaptive reuse barriers on a case project, and how IM could have been part of the solution for these problems. Finally, this study concludes with the suggestions on interface management systems (IMS) implementation for future adaptive reuse projects. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptive reuse of buildings; Barriers in adaptive reuse projects; Circular economy; Interface management system; Interface problems in construction projects",,Article,Scopus

Regulatory requirements are part of the process of drug discovery and drug development. It acts at every developmental stage. Regulatory affairs works to establish an effective and uniform balance between voluntary and regulatory compliance and agency responsiveness to consumer needs. It evaluates and coordinates all proposed legal actions to ascertain compliance with regulatory policy. The ontology presented for regulatory affairs and drug research and development gives us the possibility to correlate information from different levels and to discover new relationships between the legal aspects. In addition, the transparency of the information is affected by the inability of existing integration strategies to organize and apply the available knowledge to the range of real scientific and business issue in critical safety and regulatory applications. Therefore, the semantic technologies based on ontologies make the knowledge reusable by several applications across business, from discovery to corporate affairs.","Drug development; Legal aspects; Ontology; Regulatory affairs; Review","article; circular dichroism; clinical trial (topic); drug development; drug efficacy; drug legislation; drug marketing; drug research; drug safety; knowledge; legal aspect; pharmacodynamics; pharmacogenomics; computer program; drug screening; factual database; government regulation; information dissemination; Internet; methodology; review; synthesis; Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic; Databases, Factual; Drug Discovery; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Government Regulation; Information Dissemination; Internet; Software",Article,Scopus
