The method involves welding shear studs to the intact part of the web plate and encasing the end region in UHPC. This paper presents the findings of an experimental study on a full-scale girder aimed to assess the feasibility of rapid implementation of the repair. Reducing the construction complexities and time is critical in cases where access to the bridge is constrained or closing the bridge to traffic is not possible. To expedite and simplify repair construction, welded shear studs originally used to transfer loads to the UHPC cast were replaced with steel dowel rods. In place of conventional wooden formwork, a reusable flexible light-gauge sheet of steel was wrapped around the end. Installation of the shear connectors, installation of the form, and casting of the UHPC was completed by two workers within an eight-hour shift. The repaired girder was load tested after the UHPC gained a compressive strength of 96.5 MPa to demonstrate the adequacy of the repair for restoring the capacity of the intact girder end shortly after implementation. It is anticipated that this empirical data encourages the use of this repair technique to address the widespread problem of end corrosion in steel superstructures. © 2021","Accelerated Repair; Beam End Corrosion; Bridge Maintenance; Bridge Retrofit; Steel Girder Repair; Ultra-High Performance Concrete","Bridges; Compressive strength; High performance concrete; Steel corrosion; Studs (fasteners); Studs (structural members); Welding; Accelerated repair; Beam end corrosion; Bridge retrofit; Bridges maintenance; Corrosion damage; Department of Transportation; Repair methods; Shear studs; Steel girde repair; Steel girder; Repair; concrete structure; corrosion; maintenance; repair; steel; structural component",Article,Scopus

The urgency of their development, new improvements to existing beam structures and their application is substantiated. Proposed beams which made of a composite I-beam, but with a split section of individual elements. Particular attention is paid to collapsible products and the possibility of their delivery to the installation site in “unrolled” form, assembly and installation at the construction site, dismantling (if necessary) and reuse. Fastening between themselves is carried out on self-tapping screws or bolts, which allows assembly at the installation site. To increase the rigidity of the profiled sheet wall without significant changes in the geometric parameters, including the wall thickness, it will be sufficient to use additional profiled sheet layers for strengthening. This article discusses the bearing capacity of such beams. The software package ANSYS was used. The geometric model of the beam has been created. To check the functionality of the program, an initial calculation was made. The calculation of ten options of the beam has been made. The first three options consider three types of profiled sheet used as a wall of I-beam. Based on the calculation results, the second version of the profiled sheet was selected for the next four calculation options for different corrugation heights and three calculation options for different spans. The results of calculating all 10 options are summarized in a single table for ease of analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ANSYS software package; Bearing capacity; Corrugated sheet; Corrugated wall; Displacements; Normal and shear stresses; Prefabricated steel structures; Profiled sheet; Stress–strain state","Shear stress; Software packages; Steel structures; ANSYS software package; Corrugated sheets; Corrugated wall; Corrugated web; Displacement; Installation site; Normal and shear stress; Prefabricated steel structure; Profiled sheet; Stress strain state; Bearing capacity",Conference Paper,Scopus

Service life extension of existing structures is one of the current objectives of the industry. The lay-out of the production has to constantly adapt to changes in production, variations in demand and new products. These changes of model or demand, usually imply important changes in the facilities and machinery and therefore in the structures that support them. Currently, these support structures are destroyed at each lay-out change, mainly because an easy reconfiguration of the support structures is not possible. To achieve service life extension of existing structures it is necessary to use easily reconfigurable, reusable and removable structures. Currently there are already solutions of structures that are removable and reconfigurable but mainly in aluminum beams. Nowadays, there are no definitive solutions for steel structures manufactured with standard shapes (standard steel beams). The use of clamp joints for steel profiles would be a very interesting solution and would allow the manufacture of completely removable and reconfigurable structures. This paper proposes and uses a methodology for the experimental analysis of the bending behavior of this type of joints depending on the length of the profile flange. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bolt; Joint; Reconfigurable; Removable; Steel beam",,Book Chapter,Scopus

This regenerative approach contrasts with the traditional linear economy, which has been adopted by the construction industry. Developing new construction technologies for sustainable built environment is a top priority for the construction industry throughout the world. Much of the environmental impact from the construction industry is associated with the consumption of resources and generation of waste. The construction industry in Europe consumes over 70,000 million tonnes of materials each year and generates over 250 million tonnes of waste. Composite flooring formed by connecting the concrete slabs to the supporting steel beams has been widely used for many years and is well established as one of the most efficient floor systems in multi-storey steel frame building structures. However, shear connectors are welded through the steel decking to the steel beams and cast into the concrete; this made deconstruction and reuse of these components almost impossible. A new composite flooring system which allows for the reuse of the steel beams and composite floor slabs is developed and tested to assess its potential and suitability for reuse. This paper presents the results of a series of full-scale beam tests and demonstrates the reusability of this new form of composite flooring systems.

The extensive structural investigation of notch-damaged, unrepaired, and laterally unsupported steel beams was performed experimentally and numerically. The simply supported specimens were tested in two-point loading with the study parameters being the location and size of the notch. Some beams had one notch on one edge of the tension flange at different locations, and some beams had two notches on both edges of the tension flange. Three-dimensional numerical models were generated to simulate the behavior of the test beams. After verifying the model, the numerical analysis was extended to cover additional different notch depths and widths. The study showed that the capacity of beams with single notch was more influenced by the notch depth increase than it was by the increase in the notch width. Beams with double notches exhibited an even more pronounced and distinct decrease in the capacity as the notch depth and width increased. This investigation supports the feasibility of reusing pre-damaged steel beams in temporary structures under service loads and certain levels of damage, where the behavior of such beams is within the elastic range and the beam maximum defection is less than the allowable one. © 2021 by the authors.

The shear connector is essentially used to transfer shear forces across steel beams and concrete slabs in composite structures. However, conventional methods which rely mainly on the welded stud shear connector are not as efficient in terms of recycling and reusing building components. Therefore, to address the issues of deconstruction and materials reuse and to improve the structural performance of the composite beams, bolted shear connectors have been developed to replace the conventional welded stud. In order to further study their behaviour, the structural performance of the bolted shear connectors were simulated and compared with the welded studs using Abaqus software. A tridimensional numerical model was validated using previously conducted experimental tests and was used as a reference for the parametric study. Height to diameter ratio, friction coefficient of steel-concrete interface, and concrete strength were selected as the main variables for the parametric study, along with the effects of the bolt-hole clearance. The results of numerical simulation were used to develop shear stress and ductility criteria of the innovative shear connector for design rules. The results of parametric studies also showed that the load carrying capacity of composite beams using the bolted shear connectors is influenced by the bolt's height, the friction coefficient of contact surfaces and the concrete strength. © 2021","Bolted shear connector; Composite beam; Direct shear tests; Finite element modelling; Headed studs","ABAQUS; Composite beams and girders; Composite structures; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Finite element method; Friction; Numerical models; Shear stress; Structural analysis; Studs (structural members); Welding; 3-d finite element modelling; Bolt-hole clearance; Conventional methods; Design of composites; Friction coefficients; Height-to-diameter ratio; Steel-concrete interface; Structural performance; Bolts",Article,Scopus

However, bolted engineering structures often encounter vibration-induced joint faults like self-loosening, crack, leakage and corrosion since they are generally subjected to external dynamic loads caused by vibration environments. Joint damages would seriously affect structures' reliability and durability, and increase maintenance costs. Therefore, fault detection of bolted engineering structures is very important and necessary. For beam-like and ring-type engineering structures with single excitation and multiple damaged bolted joints, various methods monitoring changes in nonlinear structural features have been developed. To avoid the use of structural features from benchmark structures for reference during the derivation of damage indicators, a novel vibration-based fault detection approach utilizing features from damaged structures only is proposed in this study. In the new method, the dynamic model of bolted engineering structures is simplified as a general MDOF model with nonlinear elements simulating nonlinear bolt loosening faults. By changing the value of related mass, three similar equations from the damaged structure are used to form one matrix, and then the singularity of matrix is used to detect the existence and position of faults. Results from simulations on the beam-like and ring-type models with multiple damages demonstrate that the proposed approach could be an effective tool to estimate the state of bolted engineering structures. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

This causes global warming and waste problems. The demand for the reuse of construction materials is increasing, although it is not the convention, to reduce the environmental impact. Although the sustainable effect of the reuse of materials has been proven in several studies, materials are not always reused in practice, owing to the lack of an information system for reusable materials and the economic uncertainty. In this study, we propose a framework for designing structures using reusable steel beams. The design framework consists of a material bank and a design support tool. The material bank provides information on reusable materials based on the building information modeling. The design support tool generates efficient material procurement plans and provides information about the environmental and economic impact of the project. In a case study used to verify the framework, CO2 emissions were reduced by up to 77% through material reuse, which was consistent with the results of previous studies. However, owing to the cost of processing reusable materials, the overall cost was found to increase by up to about 40%. Therefore, an economic analysis over the entire life cycle when using reusable materials needs to be done. © 2020 by the authors.

Efficient material use through optimised cross-section design reduces construction material demand. Demountable steel-concrete composite floor systems are perceived as competitive when consisting of steel beams and large prefabricated concrete floor elements, with composite interaction achieved by demountable shear connectors. Compared to traditional monolithic floor systems, the demountable composite floor systems have an increased sensitivity to lateral-torsional buckling during execution, mostly because of unsymmetrical loading and the absence of rotational constraints in the execution phase. This increased sensitivity implies that the cross-section of the steel beam should not only be designed based on the required in-plane resistance, but should also maximise the out-of-plane resistance. The Energy method and Rayleigh-Ritz methods are combined to develop a prediction model for the critical bending moment of monosymmetrical web-tapered steel beams. The key cross-sectional dimensions and parameters that affect the in-plane and out-of-plane resistance are identified. An overarching strategy for the concurrent optimisation of the in-plane and out-of-plane resistance of monosymmetrical cross-sections is presented without compromising on material efficiency.

Demountability and reuse of structures contributes to the reduction of the environmental impact of the built environment. Welded headed studs used in traditional steel-concrete composite floor systems need to be replaced by demountable shear connectors to enable the transition of the construction sector to a circular business model. The demountable shear connectors are embedded in large prefabricated concrete floor elements and connected to steel beams by bolts. The holes in the beam flange are oversized to account for geometrical and dimensional deviations of all members and to facilitate rapid execution and easy demounting. The goal of this paper is to present a methodology that quantifies the required nominal hole clearance for reusable composite floor systems. Statistical characteristics of dimensional and geometrical deviations serve as input for Monte-Carlo simulations. The aggregated results of the Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine the required nominal hole clearance for a specified probability of successful installation of the demountable shear connectors. The proposed methodology is applied to the composite floor system of a demountable and reusable car park building. The contradicting requirement of oversized holes and composite interaction is solved by injecting the hole clearance with a (steel-reinforced) epoxy resin. The bearing resistance of the (steel-reinforced) epoxy resin is addressed based on preliminary results of creep experiments on resin-injected bolted connections. © 2020 Institution of Structural Engineers","Bearing strength; Composite floor system; Deviation; Resin-injected bolted connection; Sustainability",,Article,Scopus

Experimental results indicated that the shear connector has a high strength and initial stiffness, also the slip capacity that is higher than the requirements of the current codes of practice.

According to the results, the adopted modeling approach can be reliably used for the prediction of the cyclic response of hybrid SESMA-BCJs under changing various design parameters which are beyond the scope of the experimental tests. Furthermore, using the calibrated model, a comprehensive seismic parametric study was conducted to investigate the influence of various design parameters on the seismic performance of SESMA-BCJs. Finally, a new Fe-based SESMA-BCJ with a lower amount of SESMA and higher seismic performance than NiTi-based BCJs was introduced and numerically investigated. © 2019, Brazilian Association of Computational Mechanics.

In addition, there are many different types of mitigation measures, from supply-side investment solutions to demand-side efficiency improvements, which may interact, risking double-counting of abatement potentials. This paper presents a novel, transparent methodology for building a marginal abatement cost curve that allows abatement costs and potentials to be compared. This curve improves over existing methods as it allows for abatement measures to be pursued in parallel, takes into account the interplay between abatement measures and captures data on cost uncertainty. The method is applied to build the first bottom-up marginal abatement cost curve for greater material efficiency steel use in the UK. This curve is demonstrated via four material efficiency measures which do not require large changes in final uses of products: reusing steel beams in construction, specifying optimal lightweight beams in construction, choosing smaller cars and specifying high strength steel car bodies. The results show that these strategies could reduce UK steel demand and associated global emissions by approximately 12%. 17% of this potential would be viable at the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) 2030 carbon price for policy appraisal (79 £/t CO2) taking into account emissions savings associated with steel demand only. Once use-phase emissions savings are taken into account this share increases to 60%. These results can be traced directly back to underlying assumptions regarding costs and emissions allocations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","MACC; Material efficiency; Policy guidance","Cost estimating; Greenhouse gases; High strength steel; Industrial emissions; Investments; Uncertainty analysis; Abatement potentials; Efficiency improvement; Industrial strategies; MACC; Marginal abatement cost curves; Material efficiency; Mitigation measures; Policy guidance; Cost benefit analysis; steel; abatement cost; biomass allocation; carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; uncertainty analysis; Article; building industry; carbon footprint; controlled study; cost control; environmental policy; marginal abatement cost curve; material efficiency; productivity; recycling; United Kingdom; United Kingdom",Article,Scopus

Reuse of traditional composite beams is not possible due to the permanent connection between the steel beam and concrete deck established by welded headed studs. To allow for fast construction, demountability and reuse of composite beams, various demountable shear connectors can be used. In this paper the results of experiments carried out on demountable and reusable tapered composite beams, consisting of a tapered steel beam and large-scale prefabricated concrete decks, are presented. The performance of various arrangements of resin-injected bolt-coupler shear connectors was considered to optimize the beneficial effect of composite action whilst minimizing the number of shear connectors. An advantage of resin-injected bolted shear connectors is that composite action is obtained instantaneously and simultaneously for all connectors. Demountability and reusability of the composite beam were successfully demonstrated experimentally. Experimental and numerical results indicated that the number of shear connectors necessary to fulfil deflection and end-slip limits can be reduced by concentrating them near the supports of a simply-supported beam.

Traditionally, composite beams are cast in-situ and shear interaction between the concrete and steel beam is provided by welded headed studs. The application of welded headed studs prevents the non-destructive separation of the composite beam, which leads to a very low scoring in the sustainable assessment in terms of the reuse of structural components. An alternative to welded headed studs are bolted shear connectors, which allow for demountability and reusability of a (prefabricated) composite floor system. A key challenge for demountable and reusable composite beams consisting of prefabricated elements is to provide sufficient tolerances to allow for easy execution and demounting, but also to achieve a stiff and strong shear connection under live loads. The required tolerances can, for instance, be obtained by using large bolt-to-hole clearances. The, at first glance, contradictory requirement of a large hole clearance in the execution phase and high stiffness under live loading conditions was solved by using injection bolts. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the demountable and composite structures fit in the circular economy framework, and to show that such a demountable and reusable structure was successfully erected and demounted under laboratory conditions.

Push-out tests using different parameters, including the wall thickness of the steel tube and height and width of the steel strips in a perforated plate, were carried out to investigate the shear strength, shear stiffness, failure modes, and relative slip characteristics of demountable perforated square steel-tube shear connectors. By considering the ideal elastic-plastic properties of steel, the plastic deformation model of the concrete, and the nonlinear contact behavior between the steel and concrete interface, an efficient finite-element (FE) model for a demountable shear-connector analysis was established and validated by the test results. A comparison of the shear performance between a square and a circular steel tube connector with the same thickness, perforated shape, and steel weight was conducted using the verified FE models. The experimental and FE analytical results demonstrate that the demountable perforated steel-tube shear connectors possessed not only the equivalent shear strength of perforated rib connectors but also better ductility than the welded stud connectors. The shear strength and stiffness can be improved by increasing the wall thickness of the steel tube. The perforated shape slightly affected the shear stiffness but largely affected the shear strength. The square and circular steel-tube connectors have almost the same shear-yield strength. However, the square steel-tube connector has higher ultimate shear strength, whereas the circular steel-tube connector exhibits better ductility. The calculation formula of the shear-yield strength of the novel demountable perforated steel-tube connectors was provided based on the plastic-analysis principle. Its accuracy and effectiveness were proven by the agreement of the calculation, test, and FE analytical results. Finally, under an applied load, concrete slabs are considered to do not crack or crush, and the demountable connectors can transform into a plastic state. Therefore, the concrete slabs and steel beams can be easily replaced, repaired, or reused. © 2018, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

A finite element (FE) model was developed incorporating geometrical and material nonlinearities to evaluate the behaviour of joints subjected to bending moments. The numerical outcomes were validated with experimental results and compared with EN1993-1-8. The demountability of the structure was discussed based on the tested specimen. A parametric analysis was carried out to investigate the effects of steel yield strength, end-plate thickness, beam thickness, column wall thickness, bolt diameter, number of bolts and location. Consequently, an analytical model was derived based on the component method to predict the moment-rotation relationships for the sub-assemblies with extended end-plates. The accuracy of the proposed model was calibrated by the experimental and numerical results. It is found that the FE model is fairly reliable to predict the initial stiffness and moment capacity of the joints, while EN1993-1-8 overestimates the initial stiffness extensively. The beam-to-column joints are shown to be demountable and reusable with a moment up to 53% of the ultimate moment capacity. The end-plate thickness and column wall thickness have a significant influence on the joint behaviour, and the layout of double bolt-rows in tension is recommended for joints with extended end-plates.

The connector uses high-strength steel bolts, which are fastened to the top flange of the steel beam with the aid of a special locking nut configuration that prevents bolts from slipping within their holes. Moreover, the connector promotes accelerated construction and overcomes the typical construction tolerance issues of precast structures. Most importantly, the connector allows bridge disassembly. Therefore, it can address different bridge deterioration scenarios with minimum disturbance to traffic flow including the following: (1) precast deck panels can be rapidly uplifted and replaced; (2) connectors can be rapidly removed and replaced; and (3) steel beams can be replaced, whereas precast decks and shear connectors can be reused. A series of push-out tests are conducted to assess the behavior of the connector and quantify the effect of important parameters.

This paper investigates innovative connections which enable steel and concrete framed structures to be made demountable. Demountable connections considered in this paper include beam-beam connections, column-column connections and beam-slab connectors. The finite element models for the nonlinear inelastic analysis of coped beams, column-column connections and composite beams are developed based on nonlinear finite element analysis techniques using the commercial finite element program, ABAQUS. The behaviours for coped steel beams and composite beams are then compared with the corresponding experimental results. The finite element models are used to investigate the effects of material and geometric properties on the behaviour of demountable connections. The finite element models can efficiently predict the plastic damage in the coped steel beam used in beam-beam connections. It is demonstrated that the coped beam can be made demountable up to a load of about 50% of the ultimate load which is greater than typical service loads.

However, within current paradigms of lowering carbon emissions and enhancing the possibly of material recycling, such traditional composite beams cannot be deconstructed easily and their elements are not recyclable because they rely on welded headed stud connectors that are encased within cast in situ concrete to achieve the necessary shear connection. This paper presents the detailed results of quasi-static tests conducted on full-scale composite beams as part of a novel deconstructable and sustainable structural system. For this system, precast concrete slabs are attached to a steel beam using tensioned high-strength friction-grip bolts in clearance holes as the elements to provide the shear connection. The precast slabs are made using geopolymer concrete in lieu of concrete made from ordinary Portland cement, whose manufacture is a major contributor to anthropogenic CO2 emissions worldwide, thereby enhancing the low-carbon attributes of the structural system. The test results demonstrate the very significant ductility of the beams, with substantial interface slips being developed and sustained at loads close to the ultimate strength limit state. The tension induced in the bolts provides sufficient frictional resistance between the precast slabs and steel beams to ensure that the composite system has full shear interaction throughout the range of service loading.

Unknown bridge foundations pose a significant problem to the assessment of hydraulic and seismic vulnerability and post-hazard evaluation of bridges. In addition, bridge foundations reuse could become a viable option in the replacement of structurally deficient superstructures, potentially providing technical, economic, time and environmental benefits. Characterization and evaluation of existing bridge substructures has become an essential issue for the safety and serviceability of bridges. In recent years experimental modal analysis has become an effective tool for bridge condition assessment and system identification. However, many studies tend to emphasize dynamic testing and analysis of bridge superstructures with little consideration given to bridge substructure and their foundations. In this paper, a 3 non-continuous spans bridge with concrete deck and steel girders is used as a case study to investigate the possibility of characterization and condition evaluation of the substructure system leveraging dynamic testing methods. MIMO impact testing and operating modal analysis was operated on one of the piers of this bridge. Corresponding modal identification algorithms including CMIF and Bayesian operational modal analysis method is discussed. Modal parameters, including modal frequencies and mode shapes obtained from two experimental modal analysis methods, are presented and compared. © ASCE.",,"Bridges; Concrete beams and girders; Dynamic analysis; Foundations; Geotechnical engineering; Impact testing; Structural analysis; Structural panels; Bridge substructures; Bridge superstructure; Condition assessments; Environmental benefits; Experimental modal analysis; Operational modal analysis; Seismic vulnerability; Substructure systems; Modal analysis",Conference Paper,Scopus

The endplate is made of high strength steels while the beam and the column are made of mild steels. This paper presents a numerical study conducted using ABAQUS on high strength steel endplate connections after cooling down from fire, to reveal more information and better understanding on the post-fire behaviour of high strength steel endplate connections. The validation of this numerical modelling against all representative experimental results was performed on moment-rotation relationship, failure mode and yield line pattern of endplate connections, where it is found that good agreements exist. Hence this numerical analysis method can be employed with reasonable accuracy to predict the behaviour of high strength steel endplate connections after cooling down from fire. This finite element analysis provides an efficient, economical, and accurate tool to investigate the post-fire performance of high strength steel endplate connections, which can be further developed for the parametric study and post-fire evaluation of an entire steel structure with high strength steel members. This study offers a basis for structural engineers to perform accurate evaluation and safe reuse of structures with members made of high strength steels after fire. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This was the case in the design of a new art gallery constructed within the footprint of an existing 1930s apartment building for which Thornton Tomasetti (TT) performed structural engineering services. Zoning restrictions necessitated preservation of the existing exterior masonry walls. A steel skeleton was constructed within the building for bracing before removing the existing floors, and the steel was repurposed in the final composite steel/concrete frame system. Fully encased composite steel beams and columns, and concrete pan joists, were deemed best suited for the high design loads (as much as 300 psf), staged construction, and minimal structural floor depths. Thermally broken connections between the new interior framing and existing walls were required by the owner to optimize building performance. Additional structural innovations included the implementation of push piles to support the existing wall, the excavation of a new basement four feet beneath the existing foundations, a 10-foot thermally broken cantilever at the roof level, and the conversion of a portion of the building into a 40-foot high atrium.

Composite steel-concrete structural systems are very popular for medium-sized office buildings, but deconstruction and re-use in deference to demolition is difficult because the headed stud shear connectors in the composite slab and steel beam flooring system cannot be detached easily, and reuse is virtually impossible. As an alternative, it is proposed that precast geopolymer concrete panels can be attached to steel beams using pre-tensioned high-strength bolts, instead of cast in-situ floors with pre-welded headed stud connectors. The proposed floor system can be deconstructed by unbolting the precast panels, enabling recyclability of the system and providing significant advantages in a paradigm within the construction industry focussed on low emissions. A computational modelling of this structural system using ABAQUS software is presented in the paper, so that the influence of the various parameters can be undertaken without the need for expensive full-scale testing. Following calibration with push-out tests, some parametric studies are presented and an empirical equation for the strength of the shear connection is proposed.","Composite beams; Deconstructability; Friction-grip bolting; Partial interaction","Concrete slabs; Connectors (structural); Construction industry; Floors; Friction; Office buildings; Precast concrete; Steel beams and girders; Structure (composition); Studs (fasteners); Composite beam; Computational modelling; Deconstructability; Empirical equations; Friction-grip bolting; Headed stud shear connectors; High strength bolts; Partial interaction; Composite beams and girders",Conference Paper,Scopus

Steel beams are well suited to reuse, but are difficult to reuse when connected compositely to concrete slabs using welded studs. A demountable connection would allow composite performance but also permit reuse of both components at end-of-life. Three composite beams, of 2 m, 10 m and 5 m length, are constructed using M20 bolts as demountable shear connectors. The beams are tested in three-, six- and four-point bending, respectively. The former two are loaded to service, unloaded, demounted and reassembled; all three are tested to failure. The results show that all three have higher strengths than predicted using Eurocode 4. The longer specimens have performance similar to previously published comparable welded-connector composite beam results.

Much of the environmental impact of buildings is associated with consumption of resources and generation of waste, therefore reducing waste in construction is becoming a top priority for all the European governments. Composite structures formed by connecting the concrete slabs to the supporting steel beams have been widely used for many years throughout the world, this cost-effective arrangement for floor system in multi-storey steel frame building structures is responsible for a considerable increase in the load-bearing capacity and stiffness of the steel beams, which has resulted in significant savings in steel weight and construction cost. However, shear connectors are welded through the steel decking and cast into the concrete; this made deconstruction and reuse of the steel components almost impossible. A demountable shear connector is developed to assess its potential and suitability in term of replacing the welded through headed shear studs. Test results shown that these shear connectors can be easily demounted both at working and ultimate load and have a similar capacity to the traditional welded shear connectors.
