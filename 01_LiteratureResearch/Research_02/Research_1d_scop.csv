Herein, an interface engineering of g-C3N4 quantum dots anchoring on the CuFe2O4/Cu0 hollow microspheres (CNQDs@CFO) was developed to construct a novel 0D/3D broad-spectrum-response photocatalyst. In the relaying PMS-photocatalysis process, 30 μM 5-fluorouracil (5-FLU, 50 mL) was degraded by 99.4 % in 60 min with 0.2 g L−1 1.0CNQDs@C1F1O and 0.3 mM PMS. The reusability test showed that 1.0CNQDs@C1F1O maintained superior performance with a 5-FLU removal of 92.6 % after the fifth run. Meanwhile, this newly-designed material can be applied in a large temperature and pH range, and even actual water bodies with strong environmental adaptability. Theoretic and experimental analysis demonstrated that the CNQDs and Cu0 sites on CNQDs@CFO promoted the earlier PMS activation, and then dual Z-scheme heterostructures (CNQDs/CuFe2O4/CuO) was established, boosting the follow-up photocatalytic activity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Broad spectrum photoresponse; CNQDs/CuFe2O4/Cu0; DFT computation; Dual Z-scheme heterostructures; PMS induced strategy","Activation analysis; Charge transfer; Design for testability; Photocatalytic activity; Redox reactions; Reusability; Semiconductor quantum dots; Solar energy; 5-fluorouracil; Broad spectrum; Broad spectrum photoresponse; CNQD/cufe2O4/cu0; DFT computations; Dual Z-scheme heterostructure; Peroxymonosulfate; Peroxymonosulphate induced strategy; Photoresponses; Structural evolution; Copper compounds",Article,Scopus

Currently, the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants by photocatalysis are mostly in own single-pollutant environment, not in multi-pollutants system, where the common photocatalysts cannot achieve efficiently charge separate and transfer with low reactive oxygen species (ROS) efficiency. Herein, we constructed an efficient cascaded Z-scheme heterojunction Co9S8 @defective ZnS/g-C3N4 (C@DZ/N) composed of defective engineering in hollow nanocubes, which achieved excellent photodegradation activity (98.93 % for ciprofloxacin (CIP) and 97.18 % for Cr(VI) at 90 min) in multi-pollutants environment, significantly higher than the hollow cubic with Z-scheme heterojunction in single-pollutant environment (98.07 % for CIP and 98.72 % for Cr(VI) at 140 min). Defective ZnS acts as the core for direct charge transfer and separation to form a unique cascaded Z-scheme heterojunction system that blocks the type II charge transfer pathway to achieve ultra-efficient charge transfer. Furthermore, the structural characterization and ROS experimental results based on multi-pollutants models show that the cascade Z-scheme system greatly facilitates the ROS release kinetics and further leads to more electron-deficient cubic surfaces while increase the directional conversion to singlet oxygen (1O2) in multi-pollutants environment. Further tests of intermediates and reusability indicated its potential for the high-efficient treatment of multiple pollution systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Cascade Z-scheme heterojunction; Chromium; Ciprofloxacin; Defect interface; Hollow cubic structure","Antibiotics; Biodiversity; Charge transfer; Chromium compounds; Defects; II-VI semiconductors; Organic pollutants; Oxygen; Reusability; Water pollution; Water treatment; Zinc oxide; Zinc sulfide; Cascade Z-scheme heterojunction; Ciprofloxacin; Cubic structure; Defect interface; Hollow cubic structure; Inorganic pollutants; Organics; Pollutants removal; Reactive oxygen species; Water security; Heterojunctions",Article,Scopus

Designing novel metal-based catalysts and exploring their structural-activity relationship continued to be a hot topic in HCO. Herein, we reviewed the recent development of metal-based catalysts (including monometallic and polymetallic catalysts) in HCO. Regulation of metal based active sites (surface hydroxyl groups, Lewis acid sites, metal redox cycle and surface defect) and their key roles in activating O3 were explored. Advantage and disadvantage of conventional characterization techniques on monitoring metal active sites were claimed. In situ electrochemical characterization and DFT simulation were recommended as supplement to reveal the metal active species. Though the ambiguous interfacial behaviors of O3 at these active sites, the existence of interfacial electron migration was beyond doubt. The reported metal-based catalysts mainly served as electron donator for O3, which resulted in the accumulation of oxidized metal and reduced their activity. Design of polymetallic catalysts could accelerate the interfacial electron migration, but they still faced with the dilemma of sluggish Me(n+m)+/Men+ redox cycle. Alternative strategies like coupling active metal species with mesoporous silicon materials, regulating surface hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties, polaring surface electron distribution, coupling HCO process with photocatalysis and H2O2 were proposed for future research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Metal-based active sites; Ozone activation; Regulation and Authentication of active sites; Sluggish Me(n+m)+/Men+ redox cycle","Authentication; Catalysts; Design for testability; Electrons; Metals; Ozone; Ozonization; Redox reactions; Reusability; Surface defects; Active site; Heterogeneous catalytic ozonation; Metal-based active site; Metal-based catalysts; Ozonation process; Ozone activation; REDOX cycles; Regulation and authentication of active site; Sluggish me(n+m)+/men+ redox cycle; Chemical activation; ozonation; purification; simulation",Review,Scopus

In order to overcome these shortcomings and provide a viable proteolytic membrane with increasing enzyme activity and substrate accessibility, a pulsed electric field (PEF)-assisted proteolytic membrane (PAPM) was constructed by immobilizing PEF-treated pepsin on PDA and PEI co-deposited ultrafiltration membrane. The PEF-treated pepsin endowed high activity (165.33 ± 2.31 %) and charge amount (−3.95 mV), with stable and uniform particle size (39 nm). These phenomena were attributed to the multiple effects driven by PEF, including the diffusion effect, electrolysis reactions, and microstructural regulation. Specifically, PAPM retained 80 % of original pepsin activity and enhanced 25 % pepsin activity compared to the conventional proteolytic membrane (PM). Such improvement can be ascribed to two factors: Firstly, PEF regulated pepsin microstructure to an optimal structure (4.6 % increase of the α-helix and 4.0 % reduction of the random coil) for pepsin immobilization. Secondly, PEF changed pepsin charge properties from positive (+1.62 mV) to negative (−3.95 mV), while substrate charges were positive. Heterogeneous charge interactions between pepsin and substrates increased the accessibility of the substrate to immobilized pepsin, effectively promoting enzymatic reactions.

Herein, defects controlling, elements doping, and crystallinity improving triple-strategy is established to synthesize modified g-C3N4 (SCBCN0.4). The triple-strategy of modification reconciles crystallinity improvement and the decoration of moderate cyano-group defects and B and O co-dopants. Characterization experiments and theoretical calculations reveal microstructure and electronic structure optimization, improved light-harvesting capability, and enhanced carrier separation efficiency. SCBCN0.4 performs admirably in the degradation of diclofenac and a variety of other pharmaceuticals. Through synchronous oxygen reduction and water oxidation processes, SCBCN0.4 has an excellent in-situ photocatalytic H2O2 generation rate of 620 μmol/g/h (309 μmol/g/h without sacrificial agents). SCBCN0.4's detoxification, reusability, and stability were validated in several experiments.

Beyond tuning intrinsic characteristics, it is essential to address inseparability and instability issues of MOFs to fulfill the practical applications. Herein, we successfully constructed macroscopic zeolitic imidazole frameworks-functionalized melamine sponge (MS@ZIFx, x represents the ultrasonication duration) using a facile dip-coating method. By varying ultrasonication duration, the morphology and structure of the loaded ZIF were modulated from leaf-shaped phase to hollow mixed phase to achieve the excellent adsorption performance. The optimized MS-ZIF10 exhibited significantly enhanced performance for Pb(II) and Cu(II) adsorption. Specifically, the MS-ZIF10 combined high adsorption capacities (624.8 and 588.6 mg g−1 for Pb(II) and Cu(II), respectively), rapid kinetics, excellent anti-interfering capability (e.g., cations, dissolved organic matters) with outstanding reusability (removal efficiency &gt; 91.8 % after 10 cycles). The MS-ZIF10 presented satisfactory performance on Pb(II) and Cu(II) removal in various real water matrices. Fixed-bed experiments were performed to assess the practicality of MS-ZIF10, and 1821 bed volumes (BVs) and 1630 BVs of feeding streams containing Pb(II) and Cu(II) were effectively treated.

It is deduced from the results of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical quenching tests that both the radical (•OH and SO4•-) and non-radical (1O2) pathways were engaged in the CN@I/PMS degradation of PVA. In addition, the possible degradation pathways of PVA were proposed based on the DFT calculation. The optimum operational conditions, impacts of ions and the reusability of catalyst during CN@I/PMS degradation of PVA degradation were further investigated.

About 1.5 billion units are generated annually, constantly discharged in the environment with a few reusability alternatives. Therefore, rubber recovery methods and these residues’ transformation into a cost-effective product have gained attention. Aiming to minimize the usage of fossil resources and contributes to a circular economy, it was analyzed the usage of WTR particles (5–20% by weight) in castor oil-based polyurethane foams under natural aging to promote a holistic view of all factors involved in the performance of the foams. Morphological, thermal, chemical, and mechanical properties were determined before and after exposure to open air to observe the impact of photo-oxidation and hydrolysis. The increase in viscosity of pre-polymer during the rubber loading produced greater density foams with smaller cell sizes than neat PU, in which the average cell size increased after the weathering. The rubber contributes to enhancing the compressive behavior in the non-exposed samples. After exposure, the results suggest that degradation may act to increase the crosslinking density even with the presented structural changes such as yellowing and voids. Regarding thermal stability, the rubber promotes a slight decay in the ability to resist a heat flow before and after weathering. Still, the char yield increased, showing a possibility of better fire retardancy for composites. FTIR and UV–vis showed chemical structure changes as Photo-Fries network rearrangement, Norrish I random chain scission, and Norrish II β-scission.

The remarkable potential of this pain-killer leads to its excessive use and, therefore, a persistent water contaminant. Its presence in aqueous bodies is hazardous for both humans and the environment because it causes the growth of harmful drug-resistant bacteria in water. Herein, we present a comparative study of the ZnO and ZnFe2O4 as photocatalysts for the degradation of diclofenac sodium, along with their structural and morphological studies. A simple co-precipitation method was used for the synthesis of ZnO and ZnFe2O4 and characterized by various analytical techniques. For instance, the UV–Vis study revealed the absorption maxima of ZnO at 320 nm, which was shifted to a longer wavelength region at 365 nm for zinc ferrite. The optical band gaps obtained from the Tauc plot indicated that the incorporation of iron has led to a decreased band gap of zinc ferrite (2.89 eV) than pure ZnO (3.14 eV). The metal-oxygen linkages shown by FTIR indicated the formation of desired ZnO and ZnFe2O4, which was further confirmed by XRD. It elucidated the typical hexagonal structure for ZnO and spinel cubic structure for ZnFe2O4 with an average crystallite of 31 nm and 44 nm for ZnO and ZnFe2O4, respectively. The micrographs obtained by SEM showed rough spherical particles of ZnO, whereas for ZnFe2O4 flower-like clustered particles were observed. The photocatalytic investigation against diclofenac sodium revealed the higher degradation efficiency of ZnFe2O4 (61.4%) in only 120 min, whereas ZnO degraded only 48.9% of the drug. Moreover, zinc ferrite has shown good recyclability and was stable up to five runs of photodegradation with a small loss (3.9%) of photocatalytic activity.

In this paper, the mechanical, electrically conductive, and self-sensing performances of SSWs reinforced UHPC were investigated. The modification mechanisms of SSWs to UHPC were revealed by microstructure, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intrinsically electrical conductivity analysis. The results show that the 1.5 vol. % of SSWs can increase the flexural strength, flexural toughness of UHPC unnotched beams and equivalent flexural strength of UHPC notched beams by 103.2%, 146.5% and 80.0% respectively. Meanwhile, the dynamic impact toughness and dissipate energy of SSWs reinforced UHPC with the strain rate ranging from 94 /s to 926 /s are increased by 43.5% and 58.2%, respectively. The electrical resistivity is reduced by six orders of magnitudes and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy only shows small flat arcs in the first quadrant in UHPC containing 0.5 vol.% of SSWs in diameter of 20 μm. The gauge factor of UHPC reinforced with SSWs in diameter of 8 μm can reach up to 22.5, 94.9 and 43.6 under cyclic compression, monotonic compression and flexure, respectively. The microstructure analysis indicates that the modification effect of SSWs on UHPC results from the extensive network of SSWs in UHPC, the inhibition on micro-cracks propagation and the pull-out and stripping of SSWs under loading. SSWs reinforced UHPC has great potential for developing pre-cast structural elements or cast-in-place joints for prefabricated structures, which will achieve the monitoring for structural key positions and can be efficiently used for health monitoring and safety assessment of prefabricated structures driven by the sensing information of multifunctional concrete. This will further avoid the issue concerning high cost of large scale application of multifunctional concrete. In addition, the smart pre-cast structural elements can be reusable and replaceable. Therefore, developing SSWs reinforced UHPC for prefabricated structures can make infrastructures safer, more durable and sustainable. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Multifunction; Prefabricated structures; Smart; Super-fine stainless wire; UHPC","Aspect ratio; Bending strength; Computer software reusability; Concrete buildings; Durability; Electric conductivity; Electric impedance; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; High performance concrete; Microstructure; Reinforcement; Software testing; Spectrum analysis; Strain rate; Strengthening (metal); Electrochemical-impedance spectroscopies; Electromagnetic characteristic; Mechanical; Multi-functions; Pre-cast; Prefabricated structures; Smart; Structural elements; Super-fine stainless wire; Thermal; Wire",Conference Paper,Scopus

With building codes relaxing height limitations, there is a need for novel connection solutions for the next generation of tall timber buildings. There is also a need to ensure that mass timber products are being used responsibly and sustainably, with deconstruction and reuse being identified as important factors in this pursuit. This paper presents and discusses a new hybrid shear connection for mass timber buildings that allows for easy construction, deconstruction, and reuse of the structural elements. The connection consists of a fully threaded steel rod embedded into a CLT panel and reinforced with a layer of epoxy-based grout. The structural performance of shear connections with varying rod diameter and steel strength-grade, grout thickness, and CLT grade is analyzed. An insight into the behaviour under quasi-static monotonic incremental loads is given based on a comprehensive experimental campaign, with a total of 84 push-out tests performed on squared CLT specimens. Experiments show that strong and stiff behaviour can be achieved and that the yield point is clearly identifiable, supporting optimum capacity design strategies. This allows for the connection to be protected from damage and therefore reusable. Observed failure modes suggest that load-carrying capacity and stiffness models, as per common wood bolted connections, can be developed. This high-performance shear connection has great potential for deconstruction and reuse and supports prefabricated hybrid CLT-based structural solutions for large-scale building construction. © 2023, Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.",,"Building codes; Concrete construction; Grouting; Mortar; Reinforcement; Structural analysis; Wooden buildings; Epoxy-based; Performance; Reuse; Shear connections; Steel rod; Steel strength; Structural elements; Structural performance; Timber buildings; Timber products; Timber",Conference Paper,Scopus

This paper focuses on the thermal cycling durability of PZT piezoelectric transducers bonded on a Carbon Fiber Reinforce Polymer (CFRP) composite plate. The temperature cycles are set to be representative of the thermal loadings that the structure of a launcher could experience under a thermal barrier: limited number of cycles (&amp;lt;10) of short duration (&amp;lt;10 min) and high temperatures for thermoset-matrix composites (150∘ C). The heating is generated using a CO2 laser in order to obtain the steep thermal ramps (60∘ C/min) and gradients through the plate thickness to best reproduce flight conditions. To our knowledge, very few research studies have been carried out so far on the resistance of SHM systems under such environment. The degradation of the system formed by the composite plate, the adhesive and the PZT transducer is studied, in comparison with the state of reference before cycling, with three different approaches. First, electromechanical impedance is measured during the entire thermal cycling. Then the functionality of a guided wave SHM system is evaluated based on the emission and reception of Lamb waves between PZTs attached to the surface of the plate. Finally, Laser vibrometry is used to provide a mapping of the emitted Lamb waves propagation and to identify possible debondings or changes of amplitudes of waveforms after the thermal cycles. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon Fiber Reinforce Polymer (CFRP); Composite; Durability; Electro-mechanical impedance (EMI); Guided waves (GW); Laser Doppler Vibrometry (LDV); Reusable launch vehicle (RLV)","Adhesives; Carbon fibers; Guided electromagnetic wave propagation; Laser Doppler velocimeters; Launch vehicles; Reusability; Structural health monitoring; Surface waves; Thermal cycling; Transducers; Carbon fiber reinforce polymer; Carbon fiber reinforce polymers; Electro-mechanical impedance; Electromechanical impedance; Guided wave; Laser dopple vibrometry; Laser Doppler Vibrometry; Reusable launch vehicle; Reusable launch vehicles; Thermal-cycling; Durability",Conference Paper,Scopus

Various ceramic based nanomaterials have been used in efficient photocatalytic degradation of different industrial dyes. However, the major factors that restrict efficacy of these systems are requirement of UV source for activating dye degradation process, prolonged time for degradation and lower efficiency. This paves way to development of alternative material systems that can resolve above problems by not only ensuring maximum dye degradation in minimum time in presence of visible light but also reusability in several cycles. In this work, we report visible light driven photocatalytic degradation of methyl blue (MB) using Sn-doped bismuth ferrite (BFO) nanoparticles. Different concentrations (0, 1%, 1.5%, 2%) of Sn-doped BFO nanoparticles were synthesized using facile sol-gel methods. It was observed that 1.5% Sn-doped BFO nanoparticle exhibits highest photocatalytic activity towards MB degradation compared with pure and other doped BFO nanoparticles. 1.5% Sn-doped BFO nanoparticle delineates 70% dye degradation capability within 10 min of irradiation under visible light. 1.5% Sn-doped sample shows 99% degradation capability within 2 h of visible light irradiation while pristine BFO nanoparticles can degrade only 20% under identical conditions. Additionally, 1.5% Sn-doped BFO nanoparticles are also capable of degrading RhB, another important contaminant. The 1.5% Sn-doped BFO nanoparticle could be a promising photocatalyst for efficient degradation of industrial effluents having various dyes. The efficient dye degradation of 1.5% Sn doped BFO nanoparticle has been explained in terms of increased density of surface active sites evident from bulk structural analyses and greater probability of generation of electron-hole pairs on surface by virtue of reduced band gap. A theoretical modelling of band structure has been done to identify surface .OH ions as most effective species to promote dye degradation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Dye degradation; Methyl blue; Photocatalysis; Sn-doped BFO nanoparticles; Visible light","Bismuth; Bismuth compounds; Effluents; Energy gap; Ferrite; Irradiation; Light; Palladium; Photocatalytic activity; Reusability; Rhodium compounds; Sewage; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Synthesis (chemical); Water pollution; Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles; Dye degradation; Methyl blue; Methyl blue degradation; Photocatalytic degradation; Sn-doped; Sn-doped BFO nanoparticle; Ultra-fast; Visible light; Visible light induced; Nanoparticles",Article,Scopus

However, the catalytic activity is still limited by the low redox property of the active site. In this study, a novel and robust fiber-shaped cobalt ferrite catalyst was synthesized through a magnesium doping strategy. Detailed structural characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrated that the doping of Mg into CoFe2O4 maintains the spinel structure but increased the electron density of Co sites due to its similar atomic radius but different electronegativity to Co. Remarkably, the optimized MCFO-0.4 achieved superior capability for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation and outstanding performance for the catalytic degradation of Ponceau 2R (PR). Furthermore, the inherent crystal stability and magnetic nature of spinel allows for magnetically reusability and ultra-low cobalt leaching of MCFO-0.4. Radical quenching and EPR results confirmed the involvement of singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals during PMS activation, and a possible catalytic mechanism was finally proposed.

The formation of a 1T/2H mixed phase in MoS2 has been revealed by XRD and XPS analysis. Consequently, the sonocatalytic performance of the nanocomposite membrane was investigated through ciprofloxacin (CIP) and organic pollutants (Rhodamine B (RhB)). As a result, MoS2/PVDF (PM4) nanocomposite membrane exhibited a superior sonocatalytic activity with 94.37% and 84.37% of RhB and CIP degradation efficiency with pseudo-first-order kinetic constant (k) of 0.0187 min−1, and 0.0044 min−1. The sonocatalytic property of the nanocomposite membrane is related to 1T/2H mixed-phase and PVDF. Additionally, the metallic based 1T phase MoS2 helps to promote electrons and holes and reduce the recombination rate. Moreover, it promotes the generation of more hydroxy radicals (.OH), and superoxide radicals (∙O2−) play a significant role in sonocatalytic degradation of RhB pollutants. Thus, the improved sonocatalytic degradation of 1T/2H MoS2/PVDF composite membrane exhibited its application in real-time wastewater treatment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","1T/2H MoS2; Ciprofloxacin; Membrane; PVDF; Sonocatalytic degradation","Composite membranes; Fluorine compounds; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Layered semiconductors; Molybdenum compounds; Nanocomposites; Organic pollutants; Photodegradation; Rate constants; Reusability; Rhodium compounds; Wastewater treatment; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; 1t/2h MoS2; Ciprofloxacin; Effective property; Mixed phase; Nano-composite membranes; Polyvinylidene fluorides; Recyclable catalyst; Rhodamine-B; Sonocatalytic; Sonocatalytic degradation; Antibiotics; alcohol; ciprofloxacin; dimethyl sulfoxide; disulfide; edetic acid; hydroxyl radical; molybdate sodium; molybdenum; molybdenum disulfide; nanocomposite; polymer; polyvinylidene fluoride; rhodamine B; superoxide; thiourea; unclassified drug; ciprofloxacin; fluorocarbon; polyvinyl derivative; polyvinylidene fluoride; degradation; fluoride; membrane; nanocomposite; polymer; wastewater; wastewater treatment; X-ray diffraction; Article; artificial membrane; catalyst; controlled study; degradation; field emission scanning electron microscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; hexagonal crystal; pollutant; synthesis; tetragonal crystal; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; waste water management; X ray diffraction; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; chemistry; wastewater; Ciprofloxacin; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbon Polymers; Molybdenum; Nanocomposites; Polyvinyls; Superoxides; Waste Water",Article,Scopus

Firstly, a new quasi-3D dynamic landing model of vehicle under 2-2 and 1-2-1 symmetric landing mode is established, which can predict the plane motion of the main body and the spatial motion of landing struts and footpads. The strut force, footpad-ground contact force and the liquid spring damper are also included in the model. Secondly, the landing impact experiments are performed for 2-2 and 1-2-1 symmetric landing mode. The main and auxiliary strut force are obtained, along with the force-stroke diagram of damper. By comparing with experimental data, the accuracy of simulation model is verified. It is found that the simulation model possesses good match with tested responses in damping stroke and main strut force. The simulation and experiment also indicate the same trend in auxiliary strut force and main body acceleration.

Exceptionally high structural activity and excellent reusability of catalysts up to 15 cycles have been demonstrated due to the accessibility of a large number of active sites from pyridinic N-anchored Ag2O and Au particle surfaces. CG-Ag2O/Au-SiO2 with the lower Ag and Au contents of 0.59 and 0.11 wt% (ICP-MS) of active catalytic sites exhibit a superior activity parameter of 6000 s−1 g−1 (4-NP), 6357 s−1 g−1 (MB), and 2892 s−1 g−1 (R6G) than chemically synthesized and reported, bare and hybrid structures. Furthermore, the CG-Ag2O/Au-SiO2 shows excellent stability in marine water with promising reusability performance (≈93% after 15 successive cycles).

Attempting to meet the same purpose, in this study, a visible-driven nanocomposite, L-Histidine (2 wt%)-TiO2-CdS (7:1) nanocomposite, was dip-coated on the glass disc (rough vs. smooth) after the optimum composition was identified by varying the L-Histidine and CdS quantities. The prepared nanoparticles and coated catalyst on the disc were characterized by XRD, FT-IR, X-ray (FE-SEM/EDX), DRS, PL analyses in terms of their structural and optical properties as well as morphology. The coated photocatalyst was tested for photocatalytic degradation of direct red 16 (DR16) as an azo dye. The photodegradation process variables, including disc rotation speed, light intensity, irradiation time, and type of disc (smooth vs. rough glass disc)) were also modeled and optimized by central composite design (CCD). At the optimum conditions obtained, the effects of reaction time, pH, DR16 concentration, and aeration were investigated. After 3 h of using the rough disc (disc II) at a disc rotation speed of 100 rpm as well as a light intensity of 13 lumens per m2, DR16 was completely degraded. The pH and DR16 concentration seemed to have the reverse impact on the photodegradation process, whereas aeration had such a positive effect. By analyzing the effects of various scavengers, the contribution of reactive species in the photodegradation process was thoroughly investigated. Furthermore, the reusability results indicate no significant change in the photodegradation efficiency after four cycles. © 2022","Direct red 16; L-histidine-TiO2-CdS; Photocatalyst; Response surface methodology (RSM); Rotating disc photoreactor; Thin film photoreactor","Amino acids; Azo dyes; Cadmium sulfide; Glass; II-VI semiconductors; Light; Morphology; Nanocomposites; Optical properties; Photocatalytic activity; Photodegradation; Reusability; Direct red 16; L-histidine; L-histidine-TiO2-CdS; Photoreactors; Response surface methodology; Response-surface methodology; Rotating disc; Rotating disk photoreactor; Thin film photoreactor; Thin-films; Titanium dioxide",Article,Scopus

Among them, sulfonamide antibiotics widely used in humans and animals are considered to be one of the most crucial antibiotics. However, antibiotics are difficult to degrade naturally, leading to an accumulation in the environment and a potential hazard to human health. In this paper, WS2 as a co-catalyst could reduce trace Fe(III) to Fe(II) which exhibited a great activating ability to PS through the exposed W(IV) active sites, and formed the Fe(III)/Fe(II) cycle to degrade sulfachloropyridazine (SCP) continuously. This paper systematically discussed the degradation of SCP under different conditions in the PS/WS2/Fe(III) system, including the amount of WS2, Fe(III) concentration, PS concentration, initial pH, natural organic matter (NOM) and common anions (NO3−, Cl−, HCO3−, HPO42− and H2PO4−). The experimental results showed that PS/WS2/Fe(III) system possessed a strong degradation ability for SCP in a wide pH range. NO3− and Cl− could promote the degradation of SCP a little. HCO3−, HPO42− and H2PO4− could significantly inhibit the degradation of SCP. The main types of free radicals that degraded SCP were explored. In addition, the stability and reusability of WS2 were examined, and two possible degradation pathways of SCP were proposed. © 2022","Activation; AOPs; Degradation; Iron ions; Tungsten disulfide","Antibiotics; Catalyst activity; Chemical activation; Free radicals; Iron compounds; Metal ions; Reusability; Sulfur compounds; Active site; AOP; Co catalysts; Condition; Human health; Human society; Iron ions; Persulphate; Potential hazards; Sulfonamide antibiotics; Tungsten compounds; anion; bicarbonate; chlorine; dihydric phosphate; iron; methanol; natural organic matter; nitrate; persulfate; phosphate; sulfachlorpyridazine; sulfate; tert butyl alcohol; tungsten disulfide nanoparticle; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; ferric ion; ferrous ion; sulfate; antibiotics; catalyst; concentration (composition); degradation; drug; ion exchange; iron; advanced oxidation process; Article; biogeochemical cycle; catalyst; chemical parameters; concentration (parameter); controlled study; degradation; hydroxylation; iron cycle; oxidation; pH; structural stability; chemistry; human; oxidation reduction reaction; water pollutant; Anions; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Ferric Compounds; Ferrous Compounds; Humans; Oxidation-Reduction; Sulfachlorpyridazine; Sulfates; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,Scopus

Developing self-disinfecting surfaces can be a potential route for reducing fomite transmissions of infectious viruses. We show the effectiveness of TiO2 nanotubes (T_NTs) on photocatalytic inactivation of human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, as well as SARS-CoV-2. T_NTs were synthesized by the anodization process, and their impact on photocatalytic inactivation was evaluated by the detection of residual viral genome copies (quantitative real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) and infectious viruses (infectivity assays). T_NTs with different structural morphologies, wall thicknesses, diameters, and lengths were prepared by varying the time and applied potential during anodization. The virucidal efficacy was tested under different UV-C exposure times to understand the photocatalytic reaction's kinetics. We showed that the T_NT presence boosts the inactivation process and demonstrated complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 as well as HCoV-OC43 within 30 s of UV-C illumination. The remarkable cyclic stability of these T_NTs was revealed through a reusability experiment. The spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses have been reported to correlate and quantify the effects of the physical features of T_NT with photoactivity.

In our study, water-soluble polysaccharides were used to enhance the cellulose hydrogel adsorption capacity. Pectin, chitosan, sodium alginate, and three heteropolysaccharides (from corn stalk, ginkgo folium, and licorice) were crosslinked with corn stalk cellulose to form composite hydrogels.

This nanomaterial possessed strong magnetism due to the presence of Co-Ni alloy, abundant defect sites owing to N doping, and a 3D multi-porous structure resulting from CNT in-situ growth on the graphene surface. Based on DFT calculations, H-bonding, hydrophobic and π-π conjugation were inferred to facilitate bisphenol adsorption by nanocomposites, among which π-π interactions provided the greatest adsorption contribution within a given N-doping type. By employing BPM as model compound, the adsorption energies (ΔEa) for π-π conjugation were −1.80, −1.59 and −2.08 eV for graphitic-N, pyridinic-N, and pyrrolic-N, respectively. This infers that pyrrolic-N sites form the strongest BP sorption bonds with the nanocomposite. The nanocomposites were utilized as an extractant in an effervescence tablet-assisted magnetic solid-phase microextraction (ET-MSPE) procedure that was optimized using Plackett-Burman design (PBD) and central composite design (CCD). Under optimized conditions, the ET-MSPE/HPLC-FLD method provided strong analytical performance for quantification of six BPs in juice with limits of detection of 0.06–0.20 μg/L, recoveries of 82.4–103.7 % and RSDs of 1.2–5.3 %.

Various insights can be gained by displaying the model as a formal graph and querying it.

Which other components are now offline and which data cannot be gathered anymore? If a component becomes unresponsive, which alternative routes can be established to obtain data processed by it. We build on the use case of qualification and operations of a small spacecraft. Structural elements of the MBSE model are transferred to a graph database where analyses are conducted on the system.

This paper presents wet-stable, carboxymethylated cellulose nanofibril (CNF) and amyloid nanofibril (ANF) based aerogel-like adsorbents prepared through efficient and green processes for the removal of metal ions and dyes from water. The aerogels exhibit tunable densities (18-28 kg m-3), wet resilience, and an interconnected porous structure (99% porosity), with a pH controllable surface charge for adsorption of both cationic (methylene blue and Pb(II)) and anionic (brilliant blue, congo red, and Cr(VI)) model contaminants. The Langmuir saturation adsorption capacity of the aerogel was calculated to be 68, 79, and 42 mg g-1for brilliant blue, Pb(II), and Cr(VI), respectively. Adsorption kinetic studies for the adsorption of brilliant blue as a model contaminant demonstrated that a pseudo-second-order model best fitted the experimental data and that an intraparticle diffusion model suggests that there are three adsorption stages in the adsorption of brilliant blue on the aerogel. Following three cycles of adsorption and regeneration, the aerogels maintained nearly 97 and 96% of their adsorption capacity for methylene blue and Pb(II) as cationic contaminants and 89 and 80% for brilliant blue and Cr(VI) as anionic contaminants. Moreover, the aerogels showed remarkable selectivity for Pb(II) in the presence of calcium and magnesium as background ions, with a selectivity coefficient more than 2 orders of magnitude higher than calcium and magnesium.

To characterize their chemical composition, information from drilling campaigns can be used. However, the evaluation of resources in tailings deposits has several complexities such as the poor grade spatial continuity and its narrow geometry, reasons for which traditional geostatistics is not adapted to model this type of deposit. In contrast, transitive geostatistics can be an opportunity to tackle this taking advantage of the fully delimited domain in a tailings dam and a different structural analysis. By achieving a better characterization of tailings composition, it is possible to make better decisions for their reprocessing, thus supporting cleaner mining production. This study aims to provide a framework for the geostatistical modeling and prediction of remaining metal resources of the Haveri tailings in southwestern Finland. The modeled variables are the gold, cobalt, copper and iron grades, with cobalt being of special interest as a critical material. The grades have been measured at 165 drill holes, totaling 1201 samples composited at 1 meter. An exploratory data analysis is performed first to clean the database and to identify the statistical and spatial distributions of the data. Then a structural analysis is applied to model the grade spatial continuity. Leave-one-out cross-validation is subsequently used to validate the fitted model and to quantify the prediction errors. Finally, 3D block models of the gold, cobalt, copper and iron grade are constructed with ordinary kriging and transitive kriging and are compared. Cross-validation shows that both kriging methods yield a good precision of the predictions and perform equally well for copper and iron, but transitive kriging significantly outperforms ordinary kriging for gold and cobalt and also provides less smoothed block models than ordinary kriging. Transitive kriging thus appears as an effective alternative for assessing resources in tailings and other narrow deposits. Recommendations on the sampling design to optimize the coverage of the target area and to ease the covariogram inference are also given. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Covariogram analysis; Spatial prediction; Tailings revalorization; Transitive geostatistics","Chemical analysis; Cobalt; Copper; Data handling; Deposits; Economic geology; Forecasting; Infill drilling; Iron; Spatial variables measurement; Structural analysis; Sustainable development; Circular economy; Covariogram analyse; Geo-statistics; Kriging; Ordinary kriging; Revalorization; Spatial prediction; Tailing revalorization; Tailings deposits; Transitive geostatistic; Kriging",Article,Scopus

The recent literature has suggested a great potential of plasticizers to be used for rejuvenating the oxidated paving asphalts. This study was aimed at assessing the rejuvenating effectiveness by rheological characterizations of two typical plasticizers, dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and tributyl citrate (TBC), selected based on the molecular structural differences. The underlying rejuvenating mechanisms were approached using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, for probing the interactions between the plasticizers and oxidized asphaltenes and examining the outcomes in terms of deagglomeration. The results indicated that both plasticizers were highly effective in restoring the stiffness and elasticity properties as well as fatigue resistance of the aged asphalt. According to the simulations, the two plasticizers were able to deagglomerate the asphaltene associations. Owing to the high polarity and hydroxyl group, TBC appeared to be slightly more efficient in dissociating the asphaltenes, which explained its higher effectiveness in restoring the rheological properties as compared to DBP. Both the rheology and simulation results suggested that the plasticizers were rejuvenating instead of simply softening the aged asphalt. © 2022 by the authors.","asphalt rejuvenators; asphaltene deagglomeration; molecular interactions; pavement sustainability; performance restoration","Asphalt; Asphaltenes; Molecular dynamics; Pavements; Reinforced plastics; Solvents; Sustainable development; Asphalt materials; Asphalt rejuvenator; Asphaltene deagglomeration; De agglomerations; Di-butyl phthalate; Dibutyl phthalates; Pavement sustainability; Performance; Performance restoration; Reuse; Plasticizers",Article,Scopus

Here, we attempt to increase the capacity of instability-based architected materials by inducing material nonlinearity of metallic materials. Through experimental tests and numerical simulations, this work investigates the plastic deformation of metallic architected materials using curved beams (MAM-CB) and their resulting energy dissipation capacity. We first investigated the mechanical properties of various MAM-CB unit cells, and finally studied the tradeoff between energy dissipation and fatigue life by embedding a geometrical gradient. In addition, we presented a method to enhance the energy dissipation capacity of a conventional structure by adapting MAM-CB units to form a new hybrid structural device. Furthermore, this method is showcased by using MAM-CB units under a possible scenario in seismic engineering, aimed to develop novel damping components with enhanced and customizable energy-dissipating properties.

Novel synthesis routes and methods reviewed within this work, range from the use of porous precursor silica seeds, green organic templating methods, supramolecular-assembly routes, to modern mesoporogen free approaches. Five novel MPS zeolite framework families (EL-SSZ, EL-EMM, M-NUD, M-Si-Beta and M-Silicalite-1) were discussed in comprehensive fashion in relation to their synthesis methods, architectural components, and applications in the fields of catalysis and mass transport. Synthesis principles and mechanisms related to mesoporous pure silica zeolite production were addressed in comprehensive fashion with relevant mechanisms schematically represented. Applications for these materials in heterogenous catalysis exhibited high catalytic activity in high-energy conditions while maintaining their structural stability and lifetime of the matrix phase, avoiding interference with the reaction phases. The reusability and high surface area of these materials offers an eco-friendly alternative to the use of non-durable catalytic platforms such as Palladium on Carbon, while performing with equal or superior activity.

This paper investigates the mechanical properties, durability, and eco-efficiency of non-structural concrete produced with 15% and 30% of portland cement replaced by wood biomass fly ash under combined effects of w/b ratio, ash content, and curing age. Two post-treatment to improve ash reactivity (grinding and grinding followed by re-calcining) were investigated. Concrete series with 15% ash presented higher relative compressive strength than 30% series regardless of the w/b ratio. Concrete mixtures produced with a w/b ratio of 0.35 did not reach the reference compressive strength regardless of the ash content. The ash re-calcining did not improve the concrete durability and mechanical properties. The carbonation increased in blended mixtures, but at acceptable levels. The absorption by capillarity increased overmuch in blended mixtures with re-calcined ash. The energy demand for re-calcining reduced the concrete eco-ecoefficiency. Concrete produced with 30% ash are less eco-efficient than those produced with 15%, except for w/b ratio of 0.35 due to the high cement consumption.

The structural properties of this adsorbent were characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm, XRD, FTIR spectroscopy. Meanwhile, the adsorption conditions, such as contact time, initial concentration and pH, were examined to evaluate the effect of fluoride adsorption. The adsorption properties are stable under acidic conditions. Chemisorption is a rate determining step because it complies with the Langmuir model and the pseudo second order model. The adsorption equilibrium was quickly reached in 30 min (117.98 mg g−1). With good cycling performance, 98.20% of the initial adsorption capacity was maintained after 5 cycles.

In response, the Circular Economy has become a popular agenda in the construction, renovation, and demolition sector as it offers a new model that not only maximizes materials reuse and recovery but also reframes urban systems and the built environment in a closed-loop (cradle-to-cradle) paradigm. In particular, popular visions of the Circular Economy promote, among other actions, ‘optimizing’ the end-of-the-life of buildings and their materials. Deconstruction (i.e. piece-by-piece demolition) is one key optimization strategy that has received increasing, yet limited, attention by researchers. This paper traces the development of an incipient deconstruction sector in Vancouver, focusing on the possibilities and challenges of deconstruction and material recovery practices as viable strategies for a transformative Circular Economy. I investigate two related aspects: first, the emerging policy landscape surrounding green demolition, and second, the development of ‘unbuilding’ practices and more formal ‘Deconstruction Hubs’. Overall, the paper finds that while these developments represent fundamental steps towards a more sustainable built environment, there remain a number of significant social, political and economic limitations that must be confronted if we are to meet the growing demands for more radical sustainability and ‘circularity’ not only in Canadian construction, renovation, and demolition sectors, but across Canadian cities and beyond. © The Author(s) 2022.","Circular economy; construction; deconstruction; renovation and demolition (CR&D); Vancouver; waste","architectural design; construction; demand analysis; energy efficiency; optimization; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver [British Columbia]",Article,Scopus

The semiconducting metal oxides are a class of materials with high photocatalytic activity and structural stability that can be potential candidates to treat industrial effluents. Though ZrO2 has been investigated for its photocatalytic activity, the wide bandgap has limited its application in sunlight photocatalytic degradation. In an attempt to tune the bandgap of ZrO2, a heterogeneous ZrO2/g-C3N4 photocatalyst has been synthesized via a simple hydrothermal method at different weight proportions. The structural characteristics were ascertained by the XRD and FTIR which confirms the formation of the ZrO2/g-C3N4 composite. The dye degradation characteristics were investigated for g-C3N4, ZrO2 and ZrO2/g-C3N4 composite and their photocatalytic kinetics were studied. The photocatalytic activity degraded 65%, 41%, 89% of methylene blue (MB) and 60%, 38%, 77% of xylenol orange (XyO) dyes in 75 min under solar light irradiation. Further, the ZrO2/g-C3N4 (1:1 wt%) nanocomposite improves the photocatalytic rate five times for MB and three times for XyO. In addition, band gap tuning, surface morphology, and pore formation were ascertained by optical absorption, SEM and BET analysis. The optical absorption spectrum reveals that the ZrO2/g-C3N4 (1:1 wt%) nanocomposite tunes the bandgap of ZrO2 from 3.67 to 2.87 eV. BET surface analysis confirms the enhancement of the surface area upon the nanocomposite formation. These results suggest that a high photocatalytic activity has been achieved via bandgap tuning for efficient charge carrier generation and enhancement of surface area for efficient charge transfer in ZrO2/g-C3N4.

This paper provides an overview of the current state of the art in the recycling and reuse of end-of-life (EOL) fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) products. A significant proportion of EOL FRP products are thermally recycled or used as fillers in the cement industry. Complementary to the existing approaches of structural reuse of FRP is presented in this paper as component reuse strategies (CRS). Both approaches avoid separation or destruction (downgrading) of the composite materials. An application example for the reuse of a carbon-fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) base frame of an electric vehicle platform is given and analyzed with respect to known design for reuse approaches. The proposed CRS has great potential to complement existing approaches and slow down resource consumption. In addition, extended service life can make CFRP materials more economically attractive. However, further developments are needed as well as the transfer of the principle to other applications. © 2022, The Author(s).","Automotive; Carbon fiber; Circular economy; Design for reuse; Fiber reinforced plastics",,Article,Scopus

There have been an increasing number of studies in sustainable supply chain practices in the recent past. Limited studies have been done to identify the key strategic factors for sustainable operations of automotive sector in context to developing countries like India. The primary goal of this research is to undertake a thorough assessment and give a brief understanding of the barriers of sustainability in the automotive supply chain. Various barriers are identified from experts' interviews and past academic literature. An integrated approach comprising of the “decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory method” (DEMATEL) and “interpretive structural modelling” (ISM) method is employed to develop a contextual and hierarchical relationship among the identified barriers. The lack of awareness concerning reverse logistics adoption has the greatest causal effect. This is followed by a lack of information sharing on sustainable practices and complexity in measurement and monitoring of suppliers' environmental activities. To ensure the robustness of the model, sensitivity analysis has been also performed. The novelty of this work is that it identified several barriers towards a sustainable supply chain in automotive sector with a special focus on India. This work will help the practitioners to prioritize the strategic actions needed to be taken for developing sustainable supply chain management.

The adsorption capacity of these CNT-CNF-GA (CCGA) towards cationic dyes (rhodamine 6G (R6G) and methylene blue (MB)) and anionic dyes (methyl orange (MO)) was examined. The presence of oxygen functionalities gives an overall negative charge to CCGA, which exhibited a high adsorption capacity for cationic MB and R6G (96.1 mg/g and 79.2 mg/g, respectively) dyes and a relatively low adsorption capacity towards MO (51.6 mg/g). Further, by adjusting the hydrothermal treatment time, the oxygen functional group content and the surface area of CCGA were optimized to improve the adsorption capacity. All these imply that the porosity of GA, chemical and physical interaction of functional groups, overall charge on GA and the dye molecules, and the size of the dye molecules are the main criteria that affect the selective dye adsorption.

First, wool keratin was transformed to a reduced structure (WSH) with NaHS by extracting -SH groups and then reconstructed to the S-S linkages by the covalent attachment of 2-amino thiophenol (2-ATP). The graft copolymerization of 2-ATP onto this 2-ATP/WSH surface was ensured to prepare a P2ATP-g-WSH copolymer fabric. As the second process, the polymerization of 2-ATP was also performed on the WSH fabrics to prepare a P2ATP/WSH composite. The PdNP anchoring was subsequently ensured onto these copolymer and composite samples through the in situ reduction of Pd2+ to the PdNPs. The conditions yielding the highest PdNP content were investigated in detail, and the PdNP formation abilities of both fabrics prepared by different routes were compared. It was observed that the contribution of PdNPs through the P2ATP/WSH composite route was relatively high compared to that of the copolymer route. The structural and morphological alterations in the wool nature, the existence, the oxidation state, and the relative abundance (%) of PdNPs with respect to the Pd2+ ions were evidenced by many techniques in detail. After examining the performance of the PdNP composites in the catalytic reduction of two nitroarenes to the aminoarenes, the Pd/P2ATP/WSH demonstrated satisfactorily high performance in terms of reduction yield (%), reduction rate constant (min-1), and reusability, compared to that of Pd/P2ATP-g-WSH. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","2-amino thiophenol; catalytic reduction; chemical surface functionalization; Pd nanoparticles; wool fabric","Grafting (chemical); Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Palladium; Rate constants; Reusability; Sodium compounds; Wool; 2-Amino Thiophenol; Anchorings; Catalytic reduction; Chemical surface functionalization; Chemical surfaces; Heterogeneous catalyst; Pd nanoparticles; Performance; Surface Functionalization; Wool fabric; Yarn",Article,Scopus

The quest for globalisation, structural developments and other related anthropogenic activities promote the release of contaminants that induce water pollution. Hence, treatment and remediation options that can remove pollutants from watercourses and wastewater have been developed. Applied nanotechnology using carbon nanocomposites has recently drawn attention because it has the advantages of low preparation cost, high surface area, pore volume and environmental stability. Magnetic carbon nanocomposites usually exhibit excellent performance in adsorbing contaminants from aqueous solutions, and thus expanding the use of nanotechnology in water treatment is of great importance. Therefore, this review explores the geographical outlook of water pollution, sources of water pollution and types of contaminants found in water and discusses the use of carbon nanocomposites as an emerging sustainable technology for water pollutant removal. The various properties of carbon-based composites influence the extent of pollutant adsorption during water treatment processes. Most carbon-based nanocomposites are generated from biomass produced by agro-waste materials. Magnetic activated carbon nanocomposites produced from walnut shells and rice husk waste can remove 78% of Cd(II) from contaminated aqueous systems. Magnetic nanocomposites from peanut shell, tea waste, curcumin nanoparticles, sunflower head waste, rice husk, hydrophyte biomass, palm waste and sugarcane bagasse facilitate hydrothermal carbonisation, chemical precipitation, co-precipitation, chemical activation, calcination and fast pyrolysis. These nanocomposites have benefitted wastewater treatment by increasing efficiency in removing pharmaceutical, dye and organic contaminants, such as promazine, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, rhodamine 6G, methyl blue, phenol and phenanthrene. Hence, this review discusses the relatively low costs, good biocompatibility, large surface-to-volume ratio, magnetic separation capability and reusability carbon materials and highlights the advantages of using magnetic carbon nanocomposites in the removal of contaminants from water or wastewater through adsorption mechanisms. © 2022","Environment; Magnetic carbon nanocomposite; Nanotechnology; Pollutant; Water pollution","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Adsorption; Biocompatibility; Cadmium compounds; Carbonization; Chemical activation; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Contamination; Heavy metals; Magnetic separation; Nanocomposites; Nanomagnetics; Precipitation (chemical); Reusability; Wastewater treatment; Agro-wastes; Carbon nanocomposite; Environment; Magnetic carbon nanocomposite; Magnetic carbons; Pharmaceutical compounds; Pollutant; Rice husk; Water and wastewater; Water usage; Water pollution; activated carbon; carbon; dye; endocrine disruptor; heavy metal; nanocomposite; organic compound; cellulose; coloring agent; activated carbon; biomass; nanocomposite; nanotechnology; pollutant removal; separation; wastewater treatment plant; water pollution; Africa; agricultural waste; aqueous solution; Asia; biocompatibility; biomass; carbonization; Europe; hydrophyte; infectious agent; magnetic separation; nonhuman; pore volume; pyrolysis; Review; rice husk; sunflower; surface area; United States; walnut; waste component removal; waste water management; water pollutant; water pollution; adsorption; chemistry; magnetism; pollutant; sugarcane; wastewater; water management; water pollutant; Adsorption; Cellulose; Coloring Agents; Environmental Pollutants; Magnetic Phenomena; Nanocomposites; Saccharum; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Review,Scopus

It is highly necessary to disinfect and recycle the used masks. In this paper, a sustainable vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) treatment for disinfection of N95 masks was first studied. Typical antibiotic-resistant E. coli were completely inactivated with decreased abundances by 65.82% for 16S rRNA and 76.75% for SHV-4 (an antibiotic-resistance gene) in 5 min, which was further decreased by more than 90% after the prolonged treatment. The mechanism was demonstrated that VUV could damage the exterior structure and interior DNA of E. coli cells due to the synergy of UV, O3 and extensive reactive oxygen species (ROS).

As the global supply of fossil fuels becomes critical, it is important to quantify how virgin plastic made from fossil fuel sources is recovered, reused, and remanufactured. In this study, the authors undertook the first systematic literature review of Australia's plastic waste (PW) management system to assess challenges and opportunities in moving towards a circular economy. Sources included government reports, industry survey reports, academic research articles, and national household and waste data. Results of the study showed that despite the sharp exponential growth in consumption of plastics (3.5 million tonnes (Mt) in 2018–19), Australia's national recovery rate is only 11.5%, which leaves substantial room for improvement. From 2007 to 2019, average PW generation was just over 2.6 Mt and in 2019, the generation was close to 2.55 Mt. In terms of polymer types, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) generated the most, followed by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE). Close to half (47%) the volume of plastic waste is generated by households (specifically, PET and HDPE). Market growth was of biodegradable plastics is much slower than expected. Most recycling facilities use mechanical recycling as the main processing technology, and more facilities are required to process PET (especially in NSW and Victoria). The construction (built environment) sector consumes the largest quantity of recycled plastics; however, local recycled material use was only 10% in all the Australian sectors. Plastic waste is also used for energy recovery, with polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS). This study also discusses the benefits of implementing state-of-the-art processing facilities using diversified recycling technology; vertical integration of plastic manufacturers and pre-processors; regulatory and structural reform; and development of local manufacturing industries using recycled plastics. It is incompetent to efficiently resolve the Australian plastic waste problem with simply bans, it is a global cross-sectoral issue that calls for cross-departmental cooperation. The future of plastic waste management not only relies on the effectiveness of local government and recyclers, but also on community involvement, and initiatives on national, regional, and global level. Numerous stakeholders including industry insiders, governments, customs agencies, regulators, intergovernmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, and civil society need to be involved. © 2022 The Authors","Australia; Energy recovery; HDPE; Households; Mechanical recycling; PET","Elastomers; Fossil fuels; High density polyethylenes; Plastic bottles; Plastic recycling; Polypropylenes; Waste management; Australia; Circular economy; Energy recovery; High-density polyethylenes; Household; Mechanical recycling; Oil consumption; Plastics manufacturing; Plastics waste; Recycled plastics; Polyethylene terephthalates",Review,Scopus

The optimal preparation conditions of the composite photocatalyst were determined using orthogonal experiments. Through range analysis and variance analysis, the optimal preparation conditions were as follows: a molar ratio of anhydrous ethanol, glacial acetic acid, and tetrabutyl titanate of 3:175:100, and hydrothermal temperature of 150°C and hydrothermal time of 12 h. The catalyst prepared under these conditions showed high catalytic activity, with 100 % degradation of methyl orange when irradiated with a xenon lamp light source for 60 min, and the preparation conditions were feasible. The F-N-TiO2/AC composite photocatalysts were characterized using x-ray diffraction and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. On the basis of this analysis, it was found that the doping of fluorine and nitrogen did not change the anatase structure of titanium dioxide but affected the grain growth and changed the structural properties of the F-N-TiO2/AC photocatalyst.

Strategic remediation techniques for the abatement of VOCs are immensely important and immediately needed. Given a unique set of optical, mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics, inimitable surface functionalities, porous structure, and substantial specific surface area, graphene and derived nanohybrid composites have emerged as exciting candidates for abating environmental pollutants through photocatalytic degradation and adsorptive removal. Graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) containing oxygenated function entities, i.e., carbonyl, hydroxyl, and carboxylic groups, provide anchor and dispersibility of their surface photocatalytic nanoscale particles and adsorptive sites for VOCs. Therefore, it is meaningful to recapitulate current state-of-the-art research advancements in graphene-derived nanostructures as prospective platforms for VOCs degradation. Considering this necessity, this work provides a comprehensive and valuable insight into research progress on applying graphene-based nanohybrid composites for adsorptive and photocatalytic abatement of VOCs in the aqueous media. First, we present a portrayal of graphene-based nanohybrid based on their structural attributes (i.e., pore size, specific surface area, and other surface features to adsorb VOCs) and structure-assisted performance for VOCs abatement by graphene-based nanocomposites. The adsorptive and photocatalytic potentialities of graphene-based nanohybrids for VOCs are discussed with suitable examples. In addition to regeneration, reusability, and environmental toxicity aspects, the challenges and possible future directions of graphene-based nanostructures are also outlined towards the end of the review to promote large-scale applications of this fascinating technology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Adsorption; Environmental toxicity; Graphene; Graphene-based nanocomposites; Photocatalysis; Porous materials; Regeneration; Volatile organic compounds","Graphene; Nanocomposites; Pore size; Porous materials; Remediation; Reusability; Specific surface area; Electrical characteristic; Environmental toxicity; Graphene-based nanocomposite; Mechanical characteristics; Nano-hybrid composites; Nanohybrids; Optical characteristics; Photo-catalytic; Regeneration; Thermal characteristics; Volatile organic compounds; adsorption; aqueous solution; chemical compound; nanocomposite; photodegradation; porous medium; remediation; toxicity test; volatile organic compound; graphite; nanocomposite; volatile organic compound; chemistry; ecosystem; human; porosity; Ecosystem; Graphite; Humans; Nanocomposites; Porosity; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,Scopus

There, the conditions and constraints within which structural design and assembly should be developed are extreme – for example, scarcity of processed structural material, labour, machinery and imports from Earth. Consequently, the guiding design principles for building off-Earth should include efficient In-Situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU) and reusability. Significantly, these aspects have striking similarities to some characteristics of our vernacular construction history on Earth, such as inherent material efficiency and use of local materials. The majority of contemporary proposals for off-Earth design concern 3D-printed monolithic structures which are not reusable nor reconfigurable. As a result, there is scope for developing component-based, recyclable infrastructure which is based on efficient ISRU. In this research paper, we propose a two-fold assembly and structural design methodology which synthesises three-dimensional geometries in static equilibrium and vernacular construction techniques for deriving scaffoldless, component-based structures. This framework is underpinned by the development of a bespoke mechanically interlocking system which enables mortarless construction. This minimises the need for importing material binders and maximises the reconfigurability and reusability of off-Earth infrastructure. © The Author(s) 2022.","design for deconstruction; graphic statics; in-situ resource utilisation; interlocking components; Off-Earth design; reusability; structural design","3D printers; Binders; Machine design; Machinery; Structural design; Component based; Conceptual methods; Design for deconstruction; Graphic statics; In-situ resource utilizations; Infrastructure design; Interlocking component; Interlockings; Off-earth design; Static equilibrium; Reusability",Article,Scopus

Concrete also contributes to a large share of demolition waste, usually coming from building structures that are discarded because of functional obsolescence rather than of technical deficiency. Current practice for treating end-of-life concrete is to landfill it or crush it into aggregates used in new concrete mixes. Instead, a little-explored strategy consists in extending the service life of concrete elements by reusing them in new constructions. Following this paradigm, this paper presents a proof-of-concept prototype that reuses blocks cut out of obsolete cast-in-place concrete walls for a new structural application: a 10 m-long post-tensioned segmented arch footbridge. The paper details the design, material sourcing, and construction processes while highlighting the unusual features of the approach. The structural behavior is verified with a finite element analysis model and validated by load testing. A comparative life cycle assessment shows that the arch construction presents a significantly lower global warming potential then recycled concrete (−71%) or steel (−74%) alternatives and is very competitive to a timber one (+9%). In conclusion, the project proves the feasibility of a new circular economy application for the construction industry, in which new and reliable concrete structures are built with little to no cement inputs. © 2022 The Author(s)","Arch; Circular Economy; Concrete; Existing Structures; Footbridge; Life Cycle Assessment; Reuse; Structural Design",,Article,Scopus

Current protective textiles against biohazards are fabricated through finishing of textiles with bioactive agents. However, bioactive agents are leached from the treated textiles due to the poor durability following their accumulation in environment. The objective of this research was to design a sustainable approach for developing ecologically sound antimicrobial textiles in which the antimicrobial agent is covalently bonded to fabric and does not leach into the effluent when laundered. For this, a novel bifunctional reactive finish was synthesized in which chloroxylenol (antimicrobial agent) was covalently integrated into two reactive systems (triazine and vinyl sulfone). For structural validation, 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and, FTIR characterization were employed. The as-synthesized reactive finish was applied on the cotton fabric through pad-dry-cure method. The antimicrobial action of treated fabric (before and after 20 laundry cycles) towards viruses, bacteria, and fungi as well as ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) were evaluated according to standard. The treated fabric showed significant fungicidal (&gt;85 %) bactericidal (&gt;95 %), and viricidal (&gt;85 %) action, that remained effective even after 20 washes, revealing that antimicrobial agent has not leached during washing of treated textiles which established non-leaching behavior of the treated textiles.

Concrete component reuse in urban renewal will be an effective means to reduce concrete and steel production demands, whereas the conventional structural design encounters difficulties to ensure the reliability of reused components. In this work, we propose a novel paradigm for sustainability-based reliability design for the reuse of concrete components (abbreviated to sustainability-based reuse design paradigm), and a domain-specific machine learning approach is adopted to identify the reusability of concrete components and evaluate possible risks under the uncertain environment due to climate change, on the basis of the carbonation-induced degradation pattern and in-situ structure and climate data collected. The proposed paradigm has been implemented and validated in a case study of reused concrete structure design in Guangzhou area. Our results have shown that the proposed sustainability-based reuse design paradigm improves the design credibility, while the conventional design, which ignores climate change, underestimates failure probabilities grossly and overestimates the component's maximum service life by up to 22.5 years.

The present study’s aim is the utilization of g-C3N4@Cu/ZIF-8 nanocomposite to eliminate its structural defects by applying two strategies viz. doping Cu and core-shelling ZIF-8 on g-C3N4. The solvothermal method was used to prepare g-C3N4@Cu/ZIF-8 nanocomposite. Chemical and physical characterizations of the nanocomposite were identified by the different analyses. Photoreduction of CO2 was implemented in a 200-mL domestic Pyrex batch reactor under environment temperature as well as atmospheric pressure and sunlight was used as the light source. The results indicated that the CH3OH production performance in g-C3N4@Cu/ZIF8 (1%) nanocomposite was about three times higher than ZIF-8, which emerged via an increase in the surface area, decrease in electron–hole recombination rate, increase in conductivity, and decrease in bandgap invoking CO2 adsorption capacity increase. The amount of CO2 absorption in samples was 0.039 (ZIF-8), 0.043 (Cu/ZIF-8), 0.051 (g-C3N4), and 0.12 (g-C3N4@Cu/ZIF-8 (1%)) mmolg - 1 respectively. In addition, reusability and stability testing showed that after 5 reuses of the prepared nanocomposite, the degradation efficiency of CO2 photoreduction decreased from 82.1 to 71.8%.

In this study, a facile fabrication of a new recyclable reduced graphene oxide-based superhydrophobic magnetic nanomaterial is described for selective oil/organic solvent absorption from wastewater. First, synthesis and physicochemical characterizations of graphene oxide and RGO are performed. GO and RGO are obtained using the modified Hummers method from graphite and chemical reduction of GO, respectively. Second, magnetic MgFe2O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are obtained by sol–gel process and their structural/morphological characteristics are also determined. Finally, new superhydrophobic magnetic sponges, named PU/MgFe2O4/PDMS and PU/MgFe2O4/RGO/PDMS, are elaborated using polyurethane sponge, magnetic MgFe2O4 NPs, polydimethylsiloxane and with or without RGO through the immersion coating method. Studies of PU/MgFe2O4/PDMS and PU/MgFe2O4/RGO/PDMS sponges as sorbents have investigated and highlighted the positive impact of using RGO into the superhydrophobic magnetic sponge to enhance absorption capacity for oil and various organic solvents. PU/MgFe2O4/RGO/PDMS sponge shows i) excellent mechanical/superhydrophobic properties, ii) an ability to repel water whilst highly absorbing oil and organic liquids of various densities (i.e., absorption capacity of 12–36 g/g and separation efficiency up to 99.7%), iii) a reusability for oil and organic solvent removals for more than 20 cycles, and iv) an easy separation from water with a magnet.

However, there is still a lack of quantitative studies on the corresponding environmental benefits in this regard. In the present study, a life cycle assessment of a multi-storey residential reference building is carried out, comparing a flexible, reversible building design using a load-bearing steel structure and wooden ceiling elements to a conventional, monolithic design based on reinforced concrete. The assessment is carried out on a whole building level, including construction, operation, maintenance, and the end-of-life phase. Both building designs show similar results for a regular life cycle of 60 years without major refurbishment (13 and 14.5 kg CO2-eq/m2 per operational year). When longer building lifetimes are considered, the environmental impact of the reference building per operational year decreases significantly. In this context, flexible building design is advantageous as it facilitates the refurbishment of buildings, while monolithic building design often leads to premature demolition due to low adaptability. Further advantages of reversible building design include the increased potential of materials to be recirculated at the end-of-life stage of a building and in the potential reuse of structural elements. This study shows that 14% of the embodied greenhouse gas emissions of the flexible building can be avoided if the foundation, load-bearing structure and ceiling elements are kept in place for a subsequent building. Such direct reuse leads to a substantially higher environmental value retention than recycling of the same materials. © 2022 The Authors","Circular economy; Comparative LCA; Construction sector; Flexible building design; WBLCA; Whole building LCA","Architectural design; Construction industry; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Reinforced concrete; Sustainable development; Building design; Circular economy; Comparative LCA; Construction sectors; End of lives; Flexible building; Flexible building design; Monolithics; WBLCA; Whole building LCA; Life cycle; architectural design; comparative study; construction industry; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; reinforced concrete; steel structure; sustainability",Article,Scopus

Despite a rapid growth of research interest in developing Circular Economy strategies for concrete, this has mostly focussed on technical and environmental issues at the material and product scale. Holistic approaches considering wider social and political aspects as well as system-scale perspectives have been relatively neglected. This article uses a narrative review to investigate three outstanding questions to help address this gap: how concrete's material, product and system-scale attributes influence the interpretation of Circular Economy principles; how the full range of Circular Economy strategies can be implemented for concrete; and what the likely implementation issues will be when integrating different Circular Economy strategies (such as design for durability, component reuse and material recycling). From a product-scale perspective, it is argued that greater specificity is needed around the growing diversity of concrete materials and products in Circular Economy discourse - their properties are often distinct and hence specific strategies are not necessarily universally applicable. At the same time, a solely product-centric Circular Economy perspective is insufficient for concrete, and only joint consideration of structural and systemic perspectives will yield satisfactory solutions. ‘Soft’ perspectives of social, political and legal aspects cannot be viewed simply as an added bonus, but are essential to reconciling the ‘hard’ issues of technical, environmental and economic aspects that dominate discussions. Whilst concrete can and should have a key role in a Circular Economy, its success will require more than just extensions of linear economy thinking. © 2022 The Authors","Cement; Circular economy; Recycling; Resource efficiency; Reuse; Sustainability","Concrete products; Environmental regulations; Product design; Recycling; Anthropogenics; Circular economy; Concrete materials; Material economies; Materials and products; Political aspects; Product scale; Rapid growth; Resource efficiencies; Reuse; Sustainable development",Review,Scopus

Meanwhile, NAO is also suitable for seismic energy dissipation of building structures, but further research was required. Configuration and loading rate are significant factors affecting the hysteretic performance of the friction damper. Thus, cyclic loading tests were conducted to evaluate the friction behavior of friction dampers with non-metallic friction pads (Non-Asbestos Organic (NAO) and Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)), and the friction pairs were NAO-Steel and PTFE-Steel, respectively. A total of 13 specimens were designed to comparatively analyze the effects of the following factors on the mechanical performance of the friction damper: the configuration of the friction damper, loading rate, and reloading process after a reassembly. Firstly, some unnecessary friction needed to be avoided to keep the stable performance of the damper, such as the contact friction between the slot of the inner steel plate and friction pads or bolts. Secondly, the normal force of both NAO and PTFE friction dampers reduced gradually during the loading process. The former showed a higher cumulative loss rate, which increased with the initial nominal pressure. Again, the dynamic friction coefficients of NAO and PTFE friction dampers tended to be constant under high-speed loading, which was remarkably higher than that under low-speed loading. The dynamic friction coefficients of NAO and PTFE friction dampers were suggested to be 0.229 and 0.121 for structural analysis, respectively. Finally, compared with the first test of the friction damper, the reloading test results after a reassembly showed excellent reusability of both NAO and PTFE friction dampers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic friction coefficient; Friction damper; Loading rate; Non-metallic friction material; Reassembly; Static friction coefficient","Asbestos; Braking performance; Cyclic loads; Damping; Energy dissipation; Reusability; Stiction; Tribology; Dynamic friction coefficient; Friction damper; Loading rate; Metallic friction; Non-asbestos organics; Non-metallic; Non-metallic friction material; Reassembly; Stable performance; Static friction coefficient; Friction materials",Article,Scopus

The results showed that the adsorbent with 40% Al had the best adsorption rate (95.6%). The adsorbents were characterized by SEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TG-DSC, XPS and N2 adsorption-desorption, and the results showed that the adsorbents had a stable three-dimensional network structure.

Fe, Cu-codoped TiO2-SiO2 was synthesised as a novel photocatalyst active under sunlight irradiation to treat model pollutants. The synthesised catalyst samples were meticulously characterised using various techniques to evaluate their morphological, optical, and structural properties. The results of BET analysis showed that the TSFC1 sample has a large specific surface area of 288 m2g-1. Maximum degradation of DOX and OFLX (about 98%) was achieved with the TSFC1 catalyst. The photocatalytic reusability was investigated for up to seven successive cycles, and the composite particles maintained their high photodegradation activity for DOX and OFLX. TFSC1 composite, in particular, demonstrated high catalytic activity as well as excellent recovery potential, and its combination with solar light, silica, and dopants can be introduced as a promising strategy for efficiently destroying both DOX and OFLX antibiotics.

The synthesized particle was characterized to understand the structural and morphological features using HR-TEM, XRD, SEM, PL, ESR, FT-IR, XPS, EIS and N2 adsorption and desorption. The degradation rate constants for MG (0.0132 min−1) were 3.47 and 3.14 times greater than BiOBr and Ag3PO4.

CLT would therefore be a good option for recycling timber due to the high quantity of material used in CLT manufacturing. This paper investigates the possibilities of using recovered timber from demolition to manufacture CLT. Twelve CLT panels from recovered and new timber were manufactured and tested. The static modulus of elasticity was found to be the same between recovered and new timber, while the bending strength of CLT from recovered timber was lower than it was for CLT from new timber.

However, many reported cellulose-based aerogels to have the drawbacks of low oil recovery rate and poor mechanical, which limit their application. In this study, high reusable and excellent mechanical properties silylated TEMPO-oxidized nanofibers/polyvinyl alcohol aerogels (STPA) were fabricated through a three-step process of aqueous silylation, bidirectional freezing, and freeze-drying. A bidirectional freezing technique was employed to obtain two unique structural aerogels by adjusting the methyltrimethoxysilane concentration. The STPA possessed many excellent physical properties, such as ultralight (9.79 mg/cm3), hydrophobicity (136°), and compressibility; as an adsorbent, STPA showed high adsorption capacity (51–111 g/g) for various types of organic solvents. Furthermore, the excellent compressibility enables STPA fast and highly efficient recovery of the absorbed oil by simple mechanical squeeze. It possesses an excellent oil recovery rate of 80% and maintains around 90% of its initial saturated absorption capacity after 50 cycles of absorption–squeezing. Therefore, the successful microstructure design of the biomass-aerogel through bidirectional freezing could provide new thoughts for the design of multifunctional oil absorbents and STPA with good mechanical properties and reusability showing promising prospects in the field of water treatment.

Thus, uranium recovery from secondary resources has become a hot topic in terms of environmental protection and nuclear fuel conservation. Herein, a mesoporous biosorbent of a hybrid magnetic–chitosan nanocomposite functionalized with cysteine (Cys) was synthesized via subsequent heterogeneous nucleation for selectively enhanced uranyl ion (UO22+) sorption. Various analytical tools were used to confirm the mesoporous nanocomposite structural characteristics and confirm the synthetic route. The characteristics of the synthesized nanocomposite were as follows: superparamag-netic with saturation magnetization (MS: 25.81 emu/g), a specific surface area (SBET: 42.56 m2/g) with a unipore mesoporous structure, an amine content of ~2.43 mmol N/g, and a density of ~17.19/nm2. The experimental results showed that the sorption was highly efficient: for the isotherm fitted by the Langmuir equation, the maximum capacity was about 0.575 mmol U/g at pH range 3.5–5.0, and Temperature (25 ± 1◦C); further, there was excellent selectivity for UO22+, likely due to the chemical valent difference. The sorption process was fast (~50 min), simulated with the pseudo-second-order equation, and the sorption half-time (t1/2) was 3.86 min. The sophisticated spectroscopic studies (FTIR and XPS) revealed that the sorption mechanism was linked to complexation and ion exchange by interaction with S/N/O multiple functional groups. The sorption was exothermic, spontaneous, and governed by entropy change. Desorption and regeneration were carried out using an acidified urea solution (0.25 M) that was recycled for a minimum of six cycles, resulting in a sorption and desorption efficiency of over 91%. The as-synthesized nanocomposite’s high stability, durability, and chemical resistivity were confirmed over multiple cycles using FTIR and leachability. Finally, the sorbent was efficiently tested for selective uranium sorption from multicomponent acidic simulated nuclear solution. Owing to such excellent performance, the Cys nanocomposite is greatly promising in the uranium recovery field. © 2022 by the authors.

Meanwhile their ability to be recirculated before being biodegraded is important to maximize their economic value. Like all other polymers, their ability to be recycled and reused is highly dependant of their thermal stability, which also deserves to be investigated. Here, we clarify the potential impact of two natural phenolic additives, quercetin and gallic acid on the thermal stability of a promising microbial biodegradable polyester, poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV). The effect of the structure and the percentage of polyphenols (0 to 15 wt%) on the morphological behaviour and thermomechanical stability of PHBV was studied. Up to 5wt%, homogeneous blends characterized by intermolecular bonding interactions between the phenolic compounds and the polymer matrix were obtained. Above this percentage, a phase separation was observed in the presence of quercetin, while gallic acid crystals were embedded into the PHBV matrix, hindering its crystallization. It was concluded that regardless the additive percentage, the structural evolution of PHBV during the thermal treatment was strongly affected by the polyphenol structure: Quercetin slightly improved the structural integrity and thermo-mechanical stability of PHBV, while the carboxylic group of gallic acid contributed to auto-catalyse the polymer chain scission, accelerating its degradation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Biodegradable polyester; Phbv; Polyphenols; Thermal stability","Additives; Flavonoids; Mechanical stability; Phase separation; Phenols; Polymer blends; Thermodynamic stability; Bio-based; Biodegradable polyesters; Circular economy; ECO systems; Economic values; Gallic acids; Phbv; Plastic pollutions; Polyphenols; Thermomechanical stability; Biodegradable polymers",Article,Scopus

RESULTS: WSe2/In2S3 photocatalysts with favorable photostability and reusability were prepared via a hydrothermal method. The structural and morphological features of WSe2/In2S3 were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Photocatalytic performance of WSe2/In2S3 was tested by the degradation of methylene blue (MB) under visible light. The optimal degradation rate of MB by WSe2/In2S3 reached 92% within 120 min. After eight regeneration cycles, the degradation of WSe2/In2S3 still reached 70% and exhibited good photocatalytic stability. CONCLUSION: The enhanced photocatalytic activity is attributed to the formation of heterostructure of WSe2/In2S3, which could effectively separate the photogenerated e−–h+ pairs. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic degradation intermediates of MB by WSe2/In2S3 heterostructure was investigated by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.

Due to the costs and limitations of ground-based testing for large-scale vehicles, these predictions rely intensively on numerical simulations (CFD). The need of aero-thermal databases, as a fast-response surrogate model for the aero-thermodynamic heating, arises from the practical impossibility of performing unsteady CFD analysis over the entire trajectory due to the large disparity of fluid mechanical and structural time scales. The construction of these databases is based on a representative set of CFD simulations which cover, at a minimum, the flight regimes with significant thermal loads. The aim of this paper is to analyse the results of these representative CFD simulations during both the ascent flight and atmospheric entry for the RETALT1 vehicle to show typical flow field phenomena occurring during these phases and the resulting heating patterns. © 2022, The Author(s).","Aerothermal loads; CFD; RANS; Retro-propulsion; Reusable launch vehicle","Computational fluid dynamics; Database systems; Flight simulators; Launch vehicles; Reusability; Reusable rockets; Thermal load; Aerothermal; Aerothermal loads; CFD simulations; Ground based; Large-scales; Load predictions; Retro-propulsion; Reusable launch vehicles; Thermal; Thermal Protection System; Propulsion",Article,Scopus

In particular, DL-MoS2 showed a quick and overall degradation ability for RhB in just 20 min with good reusability behaviour and photostability. The excellent photocatalytic activity of DL-MoS2 may be due to accelerated electron transfer upon Sn doping and fast generated electron-hole pair because of a higher surface area of 127 m2/g.

Primarily, Mn3O4nanoparticles prepared via pristine synthetic approach at room temperature were integrated with ZIF-67/SiO2(ZFS) to attain Mn3O4/ZIF-67/SiO2(ZFSM). ZFSM was carbonized at 600 °C in an argon atmosphere followed by thermal treatment at 250 °C in air to acquire the final MCCO catalyst. The MCCO was used for the catalytic oxidation of C-H bonds, cycloalkanes, and alcohols under air atmosphere and neat reaction conditions. The other notable aspects of MCCO-catalyzed oxidation reaction include low catalyst loading (2 mg), high yield of oxygenated products, and wide substrate applicability. The exceptional catalytic behavior of MCCO can be attributed to the complementarity among Mn3O4-Co3O4and synergistic contributions from different components of MCCO such as (a) the confinement effect of SiO2coating which stabilizes the catalytic sites via encapsulation and (b) the presence of graphitized carbon component which enhances the electron transport, leading to faster reaction kinetics. The MCCO catalyst can be effortlessly recovered via an external magnetic force and exhibits exceptional reusability up to ten catalytic cycles while preserving high catalytic performance and structural aspects. Moreover, the practical utility of the current protocol was depicted by MCCO catalyzed gram-scale synthesis of high-value chemicals like acetophenone and vanillin. Overall, these outcomes represent a viable approach toward the development of hybrid catalytic systems for achieving high-value chemicals via a green and sustainable route. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

However, the efficient encapsulation of both inorganic magnetic material and organic phase change material is a challenge due to their poor compatibility. In this work, an aqueous dispersion containing methylol melamine and sodium alginate loaded with magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (SA-Fe3O4) was prepared and mixed with a paraffin emulsion. After methylol melamine was initiated to in-situ polymerize at the interface of the paraffin emulsion droplets, primary magnetic phase change microcapsules (P-MPCM) composed of a paraffin core and SA-Fe3O4/melamine formaldehyde resin composite shell were formed. Then, SiO2 sol particles were adsorbed on the surface of P-MPCM to form the final MPCM with a polymer-SiO2 double-shell (PS-MPCM). The magnetic polymer-SiO2 double-shell endows the PS-MPCM with rapid magnetic responsiveness (can be quickly collected under magnetic fields), high phase change enthalpy (184.4 J·g-1) and excellent structural stability. The phase change enthalpy and saturation magnetization of PS-MPCM have changed little after 200 thermal cycles. At the same time, the excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (93.9%) of PS-MPCM benefits for solar energy conversion utilization in actual application.

Design/methodology/approach: A critical and thematic analysis conducted on 115 scientific papers reveals a noticeable growth in adopting digital technologies to leverage a CE system. Moreover, a conceptual framework is developed to show the interrelationship between different I4.0 technologies to foster the implantation of CE in the construction industry. Findings: Most of the existing bodies of research provide conceptual solutions rather than developing workable applications and the future of smart cities. Moreover, the coalescence of different technologies is highly recommended to enable tracking of building assets’ and components’ (e.g. fixtures and fittings and structural components) performance, which enables users to optimize the salvage value of components reusing or recycling them just in time and extending assets’ operating lifetime. Finally, circular supply chain management must be adopted for both new and existing buildings to realise the industry's CE ambitions. Hence, further applied research is required to foster CE adoption for existing cities and infrastructure that connects them.

Achieving semantic interoperability is the first step to enable reuse of healthcare data. To ensure interoperability, metadata repositories (MDR) are increasingly used to manage data elements on a structural level, while terminology servers (TS) manage the ontologies, terminologies, coding systems and value sets on a semantic level. In practice, however, this strict separation is not always followed; instead, semantical information is stored and maintained directly in the MDR, as a link between both systems is missing. This may be reasonable up to a certain level of complexity, but it quickly reaches its limitations with increasing complexity. The goal of this approach is to combine both components in a compatible manner. We present TermiCron, a synchronization engine that provides synchronized value sets from TS in MDRs, including versioning and annotations. Prototypical results were shown for the terminology server Ontoserver and two established MDR systems. Bridging the semantic and structural gap between the two infrastructure components, this approach enables shared use of metadata and reuse of corresponding health information by establishing a clear separation of the two systems and thus serves to strengthen reuse as well as to increase quality. © 2022 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.","HL7 FHIR; Metadata Repository; Secondary Use","Health care; Information management; Interoperability; Medical informatics; Metadata; Semantics; Data elements; Data interpretation; Data specifications; HL7 FHIR; Metadata repositories; Model interpretations; Model specifications; Reuse; Secondary use; Value sets; Terminology; conference paper; Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources; medical information; metadata; nomenclature; health care delivery; health care facility; semantics; Delivery of Health Care; Health Facilities; Metadata; Semantics",Conference Paper,Scopus

Such characteristic methods indicate that the bonding between mesoporous CoAl-LDH nanosheets and open metal sites of metal-organic frameworks leads to non-covalent composite formation. Also, CoAl-LDH linkers add the feature of mesoporosity to MIL-100(Fe). Furthermore, the Fe-O bonds resulting from the coordination of surface -OH groups in the layered double hydroxide structure to FeIII atoms of the crystal create unique optical properties in the hybrid structure, enhancing its photoreactivity. On the other hand, the lack of pore volume changes and differences among the optical properties indicate a non-covalent composite formation between MIL-100 (Fe) and CoAl-LDH.

Based on the obtained results, the samples containing artificial aggregates had lower compressive strength (up to 30%) but better thermal performance (up to 25%) with respect to the reference sample made from natural aggregates. Moreover, substituting 10% of recycled aggregates with PET led to a greater reduction in resistance while improving the thermal conductivity. This type of concrete could improve the economic and environmental aspects by incorporating industrial wastes—mainly fly ash—thereby lowering the use of cement, which would lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions. © 2022 by the authors.

Meanwhile, the effects of diatomite dosage, Ag3VO4 dosage, PS concentration and initial pH value on ATZ removal were studied. The structural stability and reusability of Ag3VO4/Bi2MoO6/diatomite composites can be verified by cyclic experiments.

Structural and morphological characterization was performed by FTIR, SEM and optical microscopy, while the detection and quantification of EE2 were analysed using HPLC. To understand the material characteristics, the feasibility of the results based on contact time and kinetics to determine the adsorption capacity coated PU nanofibers was further investigated. Findings demonstrated that EE2 best fitted pseudo-second-order kinetics. Furthermore, the adsorption process was optimised via response surface methodology using a central composite design model by varying parameters such as pH, temperature, the concentration of adsorbate, and adsorbent dosage to determine. It was found that the modified PU membranes had a maximum adsorption capacity of 2.11 mg/g and high removal percentage efficiency of ~82.20% for EE2. Adsorption mechanism and thermodynamics were also evaluated, and the results depicted the adsorption process of EE2 occurred via intraparticle diffusion and was exothermic in nature. Finally, a reusability study was done over six adsorption-desorption cycles to test the consistent effectiveness of the modified PU membrane, which remained above 80% removal capacity.

Although reusing reclaimed material can significantly reduce the environmental impact in building construction, current design processes are not set up for this shift in thinking. Contrary to conventional practices, designing within the constraints of available material means that geometry and topology cannot be fully pre-determined. This paper introduces a design methodology for corrugated shell structures from folded sheet metal of variable geometries and properties, in which the design goal adapts to available material. It follows a two-fold approach of digital algorithm development and scanning and physical prototyping for robotic fabrication. The scanned materials database is classified based on object geometry data and material properties; such as thickness, type of metal, and spring-back values for fabrication purposes. Together with a target surface, it is an input for a generative design algorithm consisting of surface generation and optimization. The surface generation tries to approximate the target through a translation of search algorithm results for object placement into a 2D mesh graph which is then linked to 3D particle spring based form-finding. The optimization consists of evaluation of structural, fabrication, and design criteria, with finally user selection. Robotic fabrication included object recognition, metal sheet folding and consideration of different metal spring back behavior. These methods were tested on a single curved arch surface and applied to a double curved cantilever canopy as a final demonstrator. The algorithm results showed a generation of different corrugated shell topologies based on iterated object placement. As a demonstrator, a part of the selected canopy was robotically fabricated from local industrial leftovers. © The Author(s) 2022.","computational design algorithm; form-finding; machine learning; material classification; multi-objective optimization; Reuse; robotic folding; search algorithm; sensing/scanning","Architectural design; Availability; Construction; Environmental impact; Fabrication; Geometry; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Metals; Object recognition; Robotics; Sheet metal; Topology; Computational design; Computational design algorithm; Foldings; Form-finding; Material classification; Multi-objectives optimization; Reuse; Robotic folding; Search Algorithms; Sensing/scanning; Multiobjective optimization",Article,Scopus

Among the various existing methods, due to its simplicity of the process and efficiency in removing heavy metals, adsorption is widely used in wastewater treatment. Recently, a new class of materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), synthesized through hydrothermal or heating methods, sonochemistry, microwaves, and chemical ways, has been used as an effective adsorbent to remove toxic heavy metals from aqueous solutions, due to their unique properties such as their high chemical stability, high surface area, structural design, and reusability. In this review, we evaluated the various MOFs (including plain and modified MOFs, magnetic MOFs composites, etc.) for potential applications in the removal of the selected heavy metals. The values reported for the adsorption capacity of the selected heavy metal onto MOFs are in range of a few to several hundred mg/g. The mechanisms associated with these processes, i.e., physical and chemical adsorption, are discussed in detail; we assess the recent works of MOFs application in heavy metals removal, explain in-depth the physico-chemical processes governing adsorption, analyze the MOF categories and critically compare them with the existing technologies available. Overall, this review aims to gather the available knowledge on heavy metals' adsorption by MOFs and act as a guide for the development of either new MOFs or further applications of adsorption. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.","Adsorption; Heavy metals; Synthetic adsorbents; Water contaminants; Water treatment","Adsorption; Chemical analysis; Chemical stability; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Crystalline materials; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Organic chemicals; Organometallics; Reusability; Structural design; Surface waters; Toxic materials; Wastewater treatment; Aqueous matrix; Groundwater contamination; Heavy metal adsorption; Heavy metal removal; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); State of the art; Surface water and groundwaters; Synthetic adsorbents; Water contaminants; Water contamination; Heavy metals",Review,Scopus

The proposed composite material could simultaneously and efficiently remove hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] and imidacloprid and reduced strongly noxious Cr(VI) to weakly noxious trivalent chromium [Cr(III)]. The removal efficiencies of the composite material for Cr(VI) and imidacloprid could reach 95% after 15 h. The adsorption process was determined by kinetics, isotherms, and thermodynamics. The results demonstrated that the adsorption kinetics of Cr(VI) followed the pseudo-second-order model mainly by chemisorption; meanwhile, the adsorption of imidacloprid by the material conformed to the pseudo-first-order kinetics, which indicated that physical adsorption was the main process. Additionally, the intraparticle diffusion model revealed that the uptake of imidacloprid and Cr(VI) occurred via intraparticle diffusion at the composite material. The adsorption procedure for Cr(VI) was fitted to the Langmuir model (R2 = 0.995) via monolayer adsorption, and that for imidacloprid was fitted to the Freundlich model (R2 = 0.995) due to multilayer or heterogeneous adsorption. The thermodynamic research confirmed that the adsorption procedure was exothermic and spontaneous. Infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectra, and the pH effect implied that intermolecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction played a crucial role during the removal process. Fc-MIL-100(Fe) also exhibited long-term stability and satisfactory regeneration and reusability.

For MG and SY, concentration determination and the problems caused by the overlap of the spectrum of the dye, first-order derivative spectrophotometry was used to analyze the simultaneous absorption of the two dyes. The structural, morphological and magnetic property functionalization of Fe3O4-OT was confirmed by FE-SEM, XRD, FTIR spectroscopy, VSM, BET/BJH, and by studying isotherms, kinetics, diffusion, and thermodynamics parameters of adsorption. The response surface methodology (RSM) using a central composite (CCD) combined design was then used to design the experiments and optimize the process.

For optimal modular design, two key questions must be answered: (i) what should the topology of individual modules be like and (ii) how should modules be arranged at the product scale? We address these challenges by proposing a bi-level sequential strategy that combines free material design, clustering techniques, and topology optimization. First, using free material optimization enhanced with checkerboard suppression, we determine the distribution of elasticity tensors at the product scale. To extract the sought-after modular arrangement, we partition the obtained elasticity tensors with a novel deterministic clustering algorithm and interpret its outputs within Wang tiling formalism. Finally, we design interiors of individual modules by solving a single-scale topology optimization problem with the design space reduced by modular mapping, conveniently starting from an initial guess provided by free material optimization. We illustrate these developments with three benchmarks first, covering compliance minimization of modular structures, and, for the first time, the design of non-periodic compliant modular mechanisms. Furthermore, we design a set of modules reusable in an inverter and in gripper mechanisms, which ultimately pave the way towards the rational design of modular architectured (meta)materials. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Agglomerative clustering; Compliant mechanisms; Free material optimization; Modular architectured materials; Modular-topology optimization; Reusability","Clustering algorithms; Elasticity; Mechanisms; Product design; Reusability; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Tensors; Topology; Agglomerative clustering; Architectured materials; Free material optimizations; Free materials; Materials design; Modular architectured material; Modular topologies; Modular-topology optimization; Modulars; Topology optimisation; Compliant mechanisms",Article,Scopus

It is then worth designing reuse techniques for concrete load-bearing elements and to verify their environmental performance using comprehensive methods such as Life Cycle Assessment. Based on the Design for Reuse concept, this article assesses the environmental impacts of a reusable structural portal frame constitutive of a concrete building and compares it to a traditional design with new materials. It relies on data collected through an experimental protocol of reinforced concrete structures construction/deconstruction/reconstruction using hydrodemolition. Impact scores are significantly reduced for all environmental categories after a first reuse cycle, both at the scale of a portal frame or a building. Concrete, and particularly high performance concrete, has durability qualities allowing to undergo several usage cycles. The effectiveness of environmental benefits however depends on functional downgrading and material losses. Guidance should then be provided to insure that future reuse practices will actually provide the expected benefits. This has to be conducted in parallel to full-scale experiments of load-bearing elements disassembly to estimate the realistic rates that can be obtained when deconstructing a building. © 2022","Buildings; Circular economy; Concrete structures; Deconstruction; Design for reuse; Life cycle assessment","Architectural design; Carbon footprint; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Construction industry; Ecodesign; Emission control; Environmental management; High performance concrete; Reinforced concrete; Buildings sector; Circular economy; Construction sectors; Deconstruction; Design for reuse; Load-bearing elements; Portal frame; Reuse; Reuse practices; Structural elements; Life cycle",Article,Scopus

This study investigated the removal of Azo dyes from industrial wastewater effluent using immobilized Lipase enzyme on Graphene Oxide (GO) in batch mode. The Lipase enzyme extracted from Porcine Pancreas was immobilized onto the GO via adsorption, where the enzymes are attached to the support by intermolecular forces. This study aims to investigate the immobilization efficiency of Lipase on the GO and determine the effect of parameters such as Lipase concentration, pH, and temperature on the enzyme activity. The results showed that the enzyme activity increased with the Lipase concentration, pH and temperature until an optimum point was achieved. The saturation of support surface pores causes the loss of enzyme activity due to the excessive Lipase enzyme, structural deformation of the support surface and enzyme denaturation due to extreme pH and temperature. The immobilized Lipase activity and free Lipase activity were compared. The optimum Lipase concentration is 6 mg/mL, with the greatest immobilization efficiency and highest enzyme activity. Besides, the optimum pH for the highest immobilized Lipase activity is 8.0, and the optimum temperature is 40 °C. The characterization results confirmed the immobilization of the Lipase enzyme. Adsorption isotherm and kinetic studies are also carried out to investigate the dye removal performances. The highest Azo dye removal efficiency obtained is 89.47% at 240 min of contact time and 5 mg/L of initial dye concentration. Further, the reusability of the immobilized Lipase was also investigated and found that the immobilized Lipase can be reused up to four cycles. Thus, the adsorption of dyes through immobilized lipase on GO can significantly impact various industrial sectors. © 2022","Enzyme immobilization; Graphene oxide; Isotherm and kinetic; Lipase; Methyl orange dye; Wastewater effluent","Adsorption; Azo dyes; Chemical bonds; Efficiency; Effluents; Enzyme immobilization; Graphene; Reusability; Stripping (dyes); Enzymes activity; Graphene oxides; Immobilization efficiency; Immobilized lipase; Industrial wastewaters; Isotherm and kinetic; Lipase activity; Lipase enzyme; Methyl orange dyes; Wastewater effluents; Enzyme activity",Article,Scopus

However, critical drawback of low specific energy absorption in traditional NS mechanical metamaterials limits them to be applied. In this paper, a reusable continuous carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite NS mechanical metamaterial was proposed and fabricated. A combination of compression tests and numerical simulations have been carried out to gain a comprehensive understanding of the structural quasi-static mechanical properties. Repeatability of the metamaterial was then verified by cyclic compression. The results of quasi-static test show that the metamaterial has excellent reusability characteristics and good energy absorption capability. In addition, the effect of the structural parameters on the mechanical properties was revealed using the experimentally verified numerical model. Moreover, by dint of the numerical model, the effect of stacking sequence of the metamaterial on the mechanical properties was also investigated, and the correctness of the curved beams adopted 0° stacking sequence in this paper was proved. Finally, plate-impact tests were performed to investigate the cushion performance of this metamaterial.

This is a largely novel idea that is under-explored. A structured and generalized framework is presented to address and evaluate this idea. Validation of the efficacy of the framework is based on functional demonstration for a particularly compelling waste stream opportunity presented by the large number of discarded bicycle frames in many world economies. Key impediments include but are not limited to, efficient solutions to materials disassembly, sorting, structural properties assessment, markets, and re-assembly designs. Detailed analysis of modular structural truss assemblies from bicycle frames helps to demonstrate the solution steps included in the framework. In particular, the functional demonstration of the research concepts validates the feasibility of adaptively reusing bicycle frames into a modular assembly with a maximum load capacity of 3.6 kPa. The methodology presented can be used to add value to specific waste streams, contribute to reducing environmental impacts, and serve as a model for other adaptive reuse applications beyond the structural design context. The findings point to implications for product stewardship, as well as design for disassembly, and support future project development plans for policymakers.

The most modulated sample Fe-MOFs-2 exhibit high specific surface areas and higher catalytic activity, which could effectively degrade SMX via PS activation, with almost 95% removal efficiency within 120 min. The results revealed that the % RSE of modulated Fe-MOFs-2 increased from 2.31 to 3.27 when compared with the origin Fe-MOFs.

The batch sorption experiments showed that TZ-PAF possessed fast sorption kinetics, higher sorption capacity (982 mg g−1 for ReO4−) and a highest removal depth (Kd for TcO4− was 5.02 × 106 mL g−1), which could be attributed to the low-density skeleton of TZ-PAF resulting in the high density of sorption sites. XPS and SEM analyses revealed that the mechanism of TcO4−/ReO4− capture was attributed to an anion-exchanged process in which Cl− of TZ-PAF was replaced by ReO4−.

In addition, wood has a high strength-to-weight ratio and outstanding acoustic and thermal insulation properties, which make it an appropriate construction material in numerous applications, including in main structural members such as beams, columns and flooring systems as well as in non-structural members, such as windows, doorframes and insulating envelopes. Recent advancements in the production of engineering wood and efficient adhesives have made the fabrication of structural members with large cross sections, long spans and structural properties comparable to steel and reinforced concrete, feasible and cost-effective. As a result, interest in long-span timber buildings has increased greatly. In this paper, a comprehensive review of research studies investigating various aspects of long-span timber structures, including material properties, structural performance and sustainability, are presented. In particular, over 100 research papers were systematically reviewed to study the constructability of long-span flooring systems.

Further, the catalytic performance of these catalysts in alkylation for removing trace olefins from aromatics was systematically evaluated using a continuous-flow fixed-bed tubular microreactor. It was evident from the results that the synthesis variables, such as the concentration of chlorosulfonic acid, sulfonation time, and calcination temperature, were significant factors affecting the surface sulfur species and structural, textural, acidic properties as well as catalytic properties of the as-synthesized catalysts.

The wall proposed in the study can be used in fabricated steel structure or temporary structure. The three-way adjustment joint is developed between the wall and the main structure to adjust the error, which can realize the convenient disassembly and reuse of wallboard. The flexural behavior of the wallboard with varying geometric parameters was investigated experimentally and the numerical model was established to explore the thermal performance of the wallboard. The results show that the failure mode of the wallboard is the local buckling of C-shaped cold-formed steel (CFS) stud, and the ultimate capacities of all the specimens exceed 5 kPa, which can be simply estimated according to the bending capacity of CFS stud. The heat transfer coefficients of tested specimens were between 0.27 and 0.31, and the insulation frame can effectively reduce the heat transfer coefficient. In addition, the life cycle assessment (LCA) method was adopted to study the environmental impact of the wallboard. The steel and EPS contribute the most to the environmental impact and the energy consumption of EPS is the most prominent. Moreover, the synthetical assessment index is proposed to evaluate the comprehensive performance of the wallboard.

The prepared materials were characterized comprehensively and fully. Sufficient structural representation analyses confirmed the successful loading of Bi in the form of Bi@BiOx(OH)y complex beads. Based on basic photocatalytic studies, 10% (mass percentage) was found to be the best metal Bi loading. DRS, PL, transient photocurrent and EIS have explored the improvement of the photochemical properties of materials by loading Bi@BiOx(OH)y groups, particularly the improvement of photocatalytic properties by the SPR effect and electron traps. 10%Bi-OxCN exhibited the most suitable particle size of nonagglomerated Bi-metal groups, the largest specific surface area (43.53 m2 g–1), the most adsorption sites and the most significant photocurrent (8.694 × 10−2 mA cm−2) (7.78 times that of OxCN).

The effect of adding NiO NPs on PVDF/PVA are investigated using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM), Fourier Transform Infrared–Attenuated Total Reflection (FTIR–ATR), Ultraviolet–Visible Spectroscopy (UV–Vis), and High Resolution Scanning Electron Microscope (HRSEM). XRD results showed that the addition of NiO NPs increase the crystallinity of PVDF/PVA. The appearance and shifting of bands in FTIR–ATR indicate the structural change in the PVDF/PVA with adding NiO NPs combined with decrease in the band gap of nanocomposite films compared to pure blend in UV–Vis confirmed the incorporation of NiO NPs in PVDF/PVA. HRTEM shows the size of NiO NPs ranges from 3 to 10 nm which is agreed with that calculated from Scherrer equation. HRSEM shows a change in surface morphology of nanocomposite sample. Malachite green dye as a textile wastewater pollutant model was chosen to assess the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of PVDF/PVA/NiO NPs. Gradual rising of the weight % of NiO in the prepared films results in higher photocatalytic efficiencies. Photocatalytic activity of PVDF/PVA/7% NiO NPs was 95.4% degradation of malachite green dye at pH 9, 3 g/L film weight and 300 min visible light irradiation.

The overwhelming majority of the existing validation approaches focuses on the internal validity of CCMs (e.g. consistency, bias), while there is a shortage of efficient approaches for assessing the external validity (e.g. applicability, reusability). The objective of this paper is to clarify the concepts and criteria, and to develop an approach for a systematic evaluation of the applicability of a given CCM to cases that were not considered at design time. The approach is adapted from the validation square approach (VSA). The adapted methodology (A-VSA) makes it possible to evaluate CCMs from (a) theoretical structural, (b) empirical structural, (c) theoretical performance, and (d) empirical performance dimensions. Altogether eight indicators are introduced that support the evaluation process. The effectiveness of the A-VSA was confirmed through a case study, in which a specific CCM is considered and the strategy of the A-VSA was operationalized with three completely different application cases. As evidenced by the results, the proposed A-VSA establishes a tight coupling among the enablers embraced by a CCM and the aspects of theoretical and empirical validation, which approves the approach to be an efficient tool for defining the range and/or the extent of applicability. The advantage of the A-VSA is that it offers a way to transfer qualitative applicability evaluation into quantitative applicability assessment, which allows the use of both subjective statements and mathematical modeling in applicability testing. The results of the assessment can guide the adaptation work of a CCM when applied to an out-of-domain application. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Constructive computational mechanism; Practical appropriateness measures; Structural appropriateness indicators; Systematic applicability validation; Theoretical utility targets","Computation theory; Subjective testing; Constructive computational mechanism; Design time; External validities; Practical appropriateness measure; Structural appropriateness indicator; Systematic applicability validation; Systematic evaluation; Theoretical utility target; Utility targets; Validation approach; Reusability",Article,Scopus

It is partially installed by self-weight followed by insertion to the final depth by applying suction. During suction penetration, the soil accommodated by skirt wall will move into the caisson inside, leading to soil plug heave that prevents the caisson from penetrating to the desired depth. To mitigate the effect of the soil plug heave, suction caissons are fabricated with external bevels, so as to force the more expelled soil to the outside of the caisson. This paper presents failure mechanisms for calculating the penetration resistance to skirt-tip with various external bevels under two limit conditions. For the smooth base, the failure mechanism consists of two active shear zones below the smooth base and two radial and passive shear zones that are identical to those of a deep foundation. For the rough base, two active shear zones formed below the smooth base are replaced by the radial shear zones. According to the slip-line theory, the penetration resistance of skirt-tip with various external bevels is deduced in terms of su and weighted average of σi and σo (where su is undrained shear strength, σi and σo are equivalent overburdens inside and outside the caisson at the skirt-tip level). Theoretical result shows that the resistance factor Nc of skirt-tip increases with increasing αi and αo and decreasing δ (where αi and αo are adhesion factors, and δ is the angle of external bevel from the horizontal). The difference of resistance factor Nc between rough and smooth bases identically equals 0.57. Finally, numerical simulations borrowed from the literature are used to testify the rationality of the analytical solution presented in this study. © 2022","Clay; External bevel; Skirt-tip resistance; Slip-line method; Suction caissons","Caissons; Failure (mechanical); Foundations; Offshore oil well production; Pressure vessels; External bevel; Failure mechanism; Penetration resistances; Shear zone; Skirt-tip resistance; Slip line method; Smooth basis; Soil plugs; Suction caisson; Tip resistance; Soils; caisson; clay; failure mechanism; foundation; offshore structure; penetration; shear zone; structural component; suction; wind turbine",Article,Scopus

As expected, α-FeOOH particles were uniformly distributed on AC surfaces and surface-bound Fe(III) was partially converted to Fe(II) by structural hydroxyl groups of AC. The resultant Fe(II) catalyzed H2O2 to generate hydroxyl radicals (·OH) for effective E. coli inactivation by destroying its membrane and intracellular substances. The α-FeOOH@AC-H2O2 system therefore achieved an effective inactivation efficiency of 4.5 log, which was much higher than 1.6 log of the α-FeOOH-H2O2 system and 1.9 log of the AC-H2O2 system. Besides, due to the cycle of Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox on AC surface during reaction, high inactivation efficiency and low leaching iron concentration of 0.29 mg/L could be achieved at neutral condition. In addition, the α-FeOOH@AC showed excellent stability and reusability, and the used α-FeOOH@AC could be refreshed by eluting surface-bound iron oxides and reloading α-FeOOH particles with the above impregnation method.

Herein, ramie waste biomass-based adsorbents with amphoteric/magnetic multi-structures via two different fabrication routes were constructed, studied and optimized to fill the gaps between multi-structure of biosorbent and performance requirements. The results show that the biosorbents exhibit excellent adsorption and magnetic recovery performance, while the biosorbent with amphiprotic-magnetic structure exhibits higher adsorption capacities for methylene blue and congo red with maximum 195.9 mg/g and 147.7 mg/g. These results are attributed to optimization of multi-structure by regulating the introduction strategy of amphiprotic groups and Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles. The adsorption processes of the biosorbents accord well with the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Langmuir isotherm model, which suggests dyestuff are adsorbed via a monolayer spontaneous chemical reaction, and hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction are the dominant adsorption mechanisms.

Developing new MOF-based immobilized enzymes with new applications is required, not only for demonstrating the generality and applicability of using MOFs for enzyme immobilization, but also to provide potential biocatalysts for industrial applications. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of immobilizing mushroom tyrosinase on zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), with two new applications being developed. RESULTS: Upon immobilization through a one-pot in situ encapsulation approach, the resultant tyrosinase@ZIF-8 was characterized in structural features and catalytic properties. It was much more stable against pH and temperature relative to the free enzyme. The new biocatalyst was highly efficient in catalyzing the synthesis of catecholic products with pharmacological benefits (l-DOPA, piceatannol and 3′-hydroxypterostilbene) and in eliminating phenolic pollutants (phenol, p-cresol, p-chlorophenol). Excellent productivities were obtained for the synthesis of the three catecholic products (0.14, 1.38 and 1.46 g L−1 h−1, respectively). A complete removal of the three phenolic pollutants was achieved within 2.5 h, superior to other processes mediated by the same enzyme, or others, immobilized on different supports. The reusability of the new biocatalyst can be remarkably improved by entrapment into polyvinyl alcohol-alginate gel. CONCLUSIONS: Tyrosinase can be immobilized on a new type of MOF with advantages such as easy preparation and excellent catalytic performance.

Yet, the intensity of raw materials consumption, waste generation and greenhouse gas (GhG) emission in the construction industry proves that current methods of selecting building components have failed to make the deconstruction effectively feasible. Specifically, in the material selection process, most research studies concentrate on assessing environmental and economic aspects while in selecting material for DfD various factors must be considered. To overcome this gap, this study aims to propose a DfD-based material selection model which enables designers to choose materials that make the recyclability and reusability of building components feasible. To this end, the Kano model is first applied to categorize selection criteria identified via a questionnaire. After extracting the weights of criteria by using Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process, a Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution-based multi-criteria decision-making framework is proposed for choosing the best possible alternatives. Based on the research results, the framework enables designers to find decent materials in terms of DfD requirements.

In this work, for the first time, a robust, easily separable and reusable biocatalyst, Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac, was used for the degradation of a novel mineral flotation reagent 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-HQ). Under optimized conditions, Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac achieved 89.2% 8-HQ degradation efficiency within 6 h. The effect of the main constituents of MPW on 8-HQ degradation, including metal ions, organic solvents, surfactant, metal chelator and flotation frother was evaluated. The Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac also displayed favorable degradation efficiency of 8-HQ in real lead–zinc mine water. The biocatalyst could be easily recovered and had a satisfactory reusability, retaining 64.5% of 8-HQ degradation efficiency in the sixth reaction cycle. Identification of intermediate products revealed that Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac mediated reaction predominantly generated various structural 8-HQ oligomers/polymers. A potential degradation pathway for 8-HQ was speculated as follows: Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac initially catalyzed the oxidation of 8-HQ to yield the corresponding reactive radical intermediates, which subsequently undergone self-coupling reaction via C − C and C − O − C covalent coupling at their ortho and/or para positions, finally forming oligomers and polymers. The inhibition assays of marine bacterium (Vibrio fischeri) demonstrated that the toxicity of 8-HQ and its intermediate products was effectively reduced after Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Lac treatment.

These biodegradable, biocompatible and eco-benign MCSs have achieved the principles of green chemistry, and thus their usage is highly advocated. In addition, MCSs can shorten the reaction time, effectively accelerate reactions, and significantly upgrade both pharmaceutical synthesis and degradation mechanisms by preventing unwanted side reactions. Moreover, the other significant benefits of MCSs include their convenient magnetic separation, high stability and reusability, inexpensive raw materials, facile preparation routes, and surface functionalization. In this review, our aim is to present at the recent improvements in the structure of versatile MCSs and their characteristics, i.e., magnetization, recyclability, structural stability, turnover number (TON), and turnover frequency (TOF).

Then, the authors present and discuss the results of an experimental campaign on prestressed UHPC beams that were tested in bending and shear, under service and ultimate load conditions. Beams with transversal openings in the web were also tested to assess the influence of these openings on the cracking behavior and shear strength of the beams. Experimental results provide useful information for the subsequent modeling of the structural system.

This research explores how innovative strategies can be integrated for evaluating local urban and industrial wastes into sustainable building materials. A literature review is conducted focusing on circular design strategies, re-use, recycle, and waste transformation processes. Then, a methodology for the selection of upcycled and re-used building materials is developed based on Ashby’s method. A total of thirty-five types of partition walls, which include plastic, wood, paper, steel, aluminium, and agricultural wastes, are evaluated using a multi-criteria decision aid (M-MACBETH). Among these solutions, ten types of walls show high-performance thermal and sound isolation, fourteen types are effective for coating, and two exhibit structural reliability.

Moreover, significant advances have been made for predicting the response of steel members, connections, and structural systems exposed to fire. Nevertheless, the research on the reuse of steel structures after a fire event is limited. A steel structure designed according to the current seismic codes can survive a fire without significant structural damage and may be repaired and reused. Therefore, it is of great importance to study whether the reuse of steel structures after a fire is safe in high seismicity areas. This paper investigates the seismic performance of steel columns that are pre-damaged due to fire. For this purpose, sophisticated finite element models have been developed and validated against experimental data. It was concluded that the models accurately predict the behaviour of beams-columns at elevated temperatures. First, the behaviour of the columns was studied using simplified boundary conditions; the surrounding structure was not included in the numerical model. Thermal-structural analyses were performed to determine the structural damage induced by the fire. Subsequently, the cyclic performance of the columns was investigated, considering both the residual post-fire deformations and the proper material properties. Aiming to obtain more realistic results, the complicated interaction between the heated columns and the surrounding structure was considered in the modelling. For this reason, the fire behaviour of a seismic resistant frame was simulated. Then, the behaviour of fire-damaged columns under cyclic loading was assessed. The analysis of the results demonstrates the effect of the post-fire damage on the cyclic behaviour of columns. © 2022 by the authors.

Although photocatalysis method of removing antibiotics is considered as an efficient method, again the materials used for the above purpose should be environmentally benign and earth abundant in nature. Hence exploration of new materials and enhancing the efficiency of materials for photocatalytic degradation of the above antibiotic become an important topic of investigation. Inducing oxygen vacancies in an environment-benign compound like MgMn2O4 through low concentration of transition metal ion doping and their advantageous changes in optical properties are favorable for the photocatalytic application. In this regard, the changes in the structural and optical properties of the MgMn2O4 compound, by doping with Ni/Co ions is explored. It is found that the nickel doping shows a high photocatalytic degradation of norfloxacin as 90–95% within 90 min under the irradiation of UV–Vis light, which is higher than the bare and cobalt ion-doped compound. This is due to the more number of oxygen vacancies as analyzed from XPS, high light absorption, and more charge separation retention characteristics, as per UV–VIS and PL studies, respectively.

This paper uses stylized models with a monopoly OEM and provides four legislative scenarios to analyze fundamental conflicts of interest in remanufacturing and product design. Unlike previous literature, we consider remanufacturing and product design as two operating strategies simultaneously and investigate the OEM's production and collection decisions in the hybrid legislative structure. The optimal strategies are characterized by using Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. Our results show that high product design levels do not imply more remanufacturing. Remanufacturing indeed benefits from low tax rates, take-back legislation, and high-cost savings for remanufactured products, but there are some potential unintended consequences when the mandatory target becomes stringent. Then, through a numerical study, we analyze and compare different legislative structures from stakeholder perspectives. Surprisingly, our numerical result observes that take-back legislation with reuse targets maximizes the benefits for both the OEM and policy maker under certain conditions, suggesting that the reuse target can be a perfect substitute for the collection target that is the dominant form in take-back legislation worldwide.

Onsite formwork planning is often conducted via site managers' individual experience, resulting in low efficiency and waste production. The potential reuse and material waste reduction of concrete formwork should be focused on, and an automated and accurate planning approach is required. Therefore, this study proposes a building information modeling (BIM)-based framework to assist site managers in automatically obtaining accurate demands of concrete formwork to reduce waste and costs. The developed framework is introduced to provide an approach to information extraction, potential reuse, and waste reduction of concrete formwork and consists of three major parts: component information extraction, panel use planning, and concrete form planning. Geometry and quantity information of building concrete components is automatically extracted from a BIM model to provide more accurate quantity take-offs compared with the conventional two-dimensional (2D) drawings. Demands of reused formwork panels are then calculated by a designed rule-based algorithm and rules based on trades' know-how. Finally, quantities of concrete forms are minimized using a 2D cutting stock problem optimization model based on the genetic algorithm. An illustrative example of a reinforced concrete building for formwork planning is analyzed using the developed framework. Results show that the developed BIM-based framework can automatically generate an accurate plan and assist to save 28% of the formwork purchase cost compared with expert-based planning methods. Furthermore, the framework has great potential for more accurate decisions making in formwork layout planning, processing, and onsite storage. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Building information modeling (BIM); Concrete formwork; Material waste reduction; Potential reuse; Rule-based algorithm","Costs; Forms (concrete); Genetic algorithms; Information retrieval; Information theory; Managers; Reinforced concrete; Technology transfer; Walls (structural partitions); Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Concrete formwork; Formwork; Material waste reduction; Material wastes; Potential reuse; Reuse; Rule based algorithms; Waste reduction; Architectural design",Article,Scopus

The clay without any treatment indicated a lamellar type material with mesoporous distribution that presents a heterogeneous mixture of phases (type 1:1 and 2:1 structures), with a predominance of quartz, montmorillonite, gibbsite and kaolinite, and with SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, K2O, TiO2, MgO as major oxides. Its high absorption in the UV–Vis ranges with a bandgap energy of 1.9 eV was attributed to the presence of hematite. It was observed that the effects of the addition of starch before heat treatment, and impregnation with iron, modified the clay surface. F rom the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis it was concluded that a structural reorganization is related to the conversion of the various iron oxide phases into hematite, as well as promoting an increase in Fe2+/ Fe3+ redox reactions allowing rapid degradation of STZ. The catalyst impregnated with iron and treated at 600 °C showed to be an economical and versatile catalyst with high catalytic efficiency (&gt;97% STZ degradation after 60 min), with small differences according to the type of LED device used.

However, the dosage of nanometal in the composite for achieving an optimal performance is commonly larger than 10 wt%, causing high cost in raw materials. In this work, a composite photocatalyst of flower-like bismuth tungstate (Bi2WO6) nanosheets decorated by low-dosage silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with the excellent photocatalytic activity for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) degradation was prepared. Further, the morphological and structural characteristics, chemical compositions, and photoelectrical properties of this composite photocatalyst (Ag/Bi2WO6) were investigated. Different loading amounts of Ag NPs (1, 3 and 5 wt%) in Ag/Bi2WO6 were modulated, and when the dosage of Ag NPs was controlled to be only 3 wt%, the composite photocatalyst exhibited the most efficient degradation that 95.04% of SMX was removed within 60 min under visible light irradiation, which has around 3 times enhancement compared to single Bi2WO6. The sacrificial agent experiment indicated that •O2− and •OH are the main active substances in the photocatalytic degradation of SMX. And the cyclic experiment further confirmed the Ag/Bi2WO6 composite with high stability and reusability. The photocatalytic mechanism was verifiably proposed that the enhanced degradation performance was derived from more effective light absorption and photogenerated charge separation by loading Ag NPs onto Bi2WO6.

The removal of cresols from water was carried out in nine cycles of sorption–desorption in fixed-column experiments with the cyclodextrin hydrogel, achieving sorption capacities of 6.2, 11.6, and 15.1 mg/g for o-, m-, p-cresol, respectively. These differences in sorption capacities are due to the different chemical structures of cresols, that is, the relative position of the methyl and hydroxyl groups.

To mitigate CO2 emissions and TW landfilled, its reuse and recycling are considered promising in fulfilling the circular economy principles. Furthermore, its valorization as building materials components may be a contribution towards sustainable construction. Studies already developed in this domain demonstrate that more research work is needed so the suitability of TW as building insulation materials can be assessed. In this context, it is intended with the research work here presented to propose cement-based lightweight blocks (LWB) incorporating TW and discuss their application as insulation materials purposes. The studied TW was fabric leftovers from the textile industry, constituted by 70 % wool, 25% viscose, and 5% elastane. TW percentages of 6.25%, 8.16%, and 8.75% were considered in the cement mixture composition of LWB1, LWB2 and LWB3, respectively, and their influence on the LWB thermal performance was analyzed. The LWB thermal performance characterization was carried out by analyzing heat fluxes, inner surface temperatures, thermal transmission coefficients, and infrared thermal imaging. The obtained results revealed their suitability for thermal insulation applications. Values of 0.34 m2°C/W, 0.61 m2°C/W, and 0.67 m2°C/W were estimated for the thermal resistance of LWB1, LWB2 and LWB3, respectively, achieving higher thermal stability when higher percentage of TW is incorporated in the cementitious mixture composition.

Finding ways to reuse composite materials is fundamental given their huge availability worldwide. However, the intrinsic characteristics of composite materials make it hard to recover their primary constituents. Therefore, the incorporation of these materials after their typical life span into other applications is of great importance towards their circularity and valorisation. In this paper we evaluate the possibility of recycled fiberglass sheets to be used for the creation of gypsum-based composites, aiming at improving the mechanical properties when compared to conventional gypsum. We benchmark the effect of adding recycled fibers against the use of virgin ones. Neat gypsum plaster was used as the matrix and reinforced with both commercial E-glass and recycled fibers. The addition of recycled fibers into the gypsum matrix modified the material behaviour, preventing a purely brittle behaviour, and increasing the flexural strength by 66 % when 6 wt. % was added. The addition of virgin E-glass fibers not only allows for massive plastic deformation of the composite but also increases its flexural strength by nearly 290 % when a mass fraction of 12 wt. % of E-glass was added. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Composites; Gypsum; Mechanical properties; Structural applications; Traditional ceramics","Bending strength; Glass fibers; Recycling; Reinforced plastics; Composites material; E-glass fibers; Glass-fibers; matrix; Recyclability; Recycled fibers; Recycled glass; Reuse; Structural applications; Traditional ceramics; Gypsum",Article,Scopus

This paper evaluated the reuse potential of waste RAC suffered different FT cycles as CRA for structural concrete by FT damage. C40 RAC specimens with 100% replacement rate were produced and the FT damage through a coupled action of FT cycles and 35% bending load was assessed. The RAC were crushed into second-generation CRA after every 100 FT cycles until FT failure. Results showed that the evolution process of FT damage on physical properties of CRA can be divided into four stages: reinforcement stage, transition stage, weakening stage and failure stage. In the evolution process, the apparent density of second-generation CRA decreased with FT cycles, while the crushing value, water absorption and soundness (mass loss) increased. The particle size of second-generation CRA gradually decreased with the accumulation of FT damage, and the screening curve of the CRA after 400 FT cycles cannot meet the requirements of continuous particle size. Relative dynamic modulus of elasticity (RDME) was more sensitive than mass loss rate in assessing the frost resistance durability of RAC. The FT damage threshold of RAC based on the properties requirements of type II and type III CRA was 0.085 and 0.359, respectively, indicating that the FT damage threshold of waste RAC crushing as CRA for structural concrete was 0.36, and the corresponding RDME was 64% rather than 60%. The microscopic analysis showed that the weakening of adhesive mortar and ITZ was the fundamental reason for the decrease of physical properties of the second-generation CRA.

Enlightened by this objective, an efficient and easily scalable organic-inorganic hybrid magnetically retrievable halloysite nanotube-based copper nanocatalyst was developed via the immobilization of copper complex onto the surface of CPTMS-functionalized magnetic halloysite nanotubes. Combined microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, such as FE-SEM, TEM, XRD, FT-IR, VSM and XPS, were employed to provide valuable insights into the structural, morphological and physicochemical features of the as prepared Cu(ii)@DCH@CPTMS@MHNT nanocomposites. The catalytic efficacy of the synthesized heterogeneous catalysts was examined in the multicomponent one-pot synthesis of pharmaceutically interesting diverse 1,8-dioxo-octahydroxanthenes scaffolds without the need for any special additive or intermediate isolation. The illustrations observed in this work not only reveal the outstanding catalytic activity exhibited by the catalyst, but also display some of the other fascinating features, such as ambient reaction conditions, easy work-up, shorter reaction time, broad substrate scope, high turnover number and no use of toxic organic solvents. Besides, the most attractive aspect of the present protocol is that the catalyst could be facilely retrieved with the aid of an external magnetic force and recycled for up to five runs without losing its catalytic activity significantly. Owing to the outstanding catalytic activity, excellent functional group tolerance and facile recovery reusability, it is further envisaged that newly deisgned Cu(ii)@DCH@CPTMS@MHNTs could serve as a versatile platform for multipurpose industrially relevant organic transformations to meet the global requirements for sustainable green production and utilization. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique",,"Copper compounds; Kaolinite; Nanocatalysts; Nanotubes; organic-inorganic materials; Reusability; Scaffolds; Copper complexes; Frontline; Functionalized; Halloysite; Halloysite nanotubes; Immobilisation; Low-costs; Nano-catalyst; Organic/Inorganic hybrids; ]+ catalyst; Catalyst activity",Article,Scopus

This is particularly relevant for the construction sector, which is the highest producer of waste and one of the main causes of resources consumption. The paper objective is to analyse the present level of application of circularity strategies, identifying the related barriers and drivers, through interviews with building stakeholders across five European countries, Belgium (Flanders), Netherlands, United Kingdom, Denmark, and Italy. The analysis focuses on the building level and assesses the level of application in current policies and practices of circular strategies in three key field: resource and waste management, design for reversible building, and business for the networking of operators in the construction value chain. The results highlight the different and fragmented circular strategies currently applied in the analysed countries analysed, highlighting the need for more effective and coordinated actions and policies promoted by European Commission. In particular, the current legislative framework promotes the waste management strategies, focusing more on recycling practices than on reuse or resource management. The design strategies for reversible building are generally in private initiatives, driven by market competitions, rather than by public incentives. The application of circular business models and the creation of circular networks among the operators of the value chain is still lacking. Furthermore, the use of life-cycle tools to assess the environmental effectiveness (sustainability) of circular strategies is rarely applied. The recommendations that emerged from the comparison of the current applications of circular economy strategies across the countries analysed and demanded by key players in the construction sector interviewed, include the need for greater international coordination in terms of policy, practices and enabling tools (digital data, platforms, traceability). Improvements in both the legislative framework and practices are needed.

As coffee production and beverage consumption are increasing worldwide, a more sustainable waste management is required since the usual disposal in landfill is a liability to both humans and the environment. This paper is aimed at showing a possible alternative reuse of coffee ground wastes in novel green building materials intended for thermo-plastering applications in construction, in a circular economy context. Coffee waste was used in various percentages (up to 17.5%) to assess the engineering performance of the produced bio-composite mortars. The main results showed that just a little amount of coffee waste determines a bulk density decrease up to 15.4% (making the products comparable to a structural lightweight conglomerate or a light plastering mortar), an extensive drop in mechanical performance (still maintaining acceptable values for the considered plastering application) and in thermal conductivity (up to 47%). Moreover, a multi-criteria analysis, not only able to consider the materials performance, but also aspects related to the environmental impact and the economic drawback, has been implemented resulting that the preferable mix would contain 10% waste.

In particular, the graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), an earth-abundant metal-free conjugated polymer, has acquired extensive application scope and interdisciplinary consideration owing to its outstanding structural and physicochemical properties. However, several issues such as the high recombination rate of the photo-generated electron-hole pairs, smaller specific surface area, and lower electrical conductivity curtail the catalytic efficacy of bulk g-C3N4. Another challenging task is separating the catalyst from the reaction medium, limiting their reusability and practical applications. Therefore, several methodologies are adopted strategically to tackle these issues. Attention is being paid, especially to the magnetic nanocomposites (NCs) based catalysts to enhance efficiency and proficient reusability property. This review summarizes the latest progress related to the design and development of magnetic g-C3N4-based NCs and their utilization in photocatalytic systems. The usefulness of the semiconductor heterojunctions on the catalytic activity, working mechanism, and degradation of pollutants are discussed in detail. The major challenges and prospects of using magnetic g-C3N4-based NCs for photocatalytic applications are highlighted in this report. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","graphitic carbon nitride; heterojunctions; magnetic nanocomposites; photocatalysis; pollutants","Carbon nitride; Catalyst activity; Conjugated polymers; Magnetism; Nanocomposites; Organic pollutants; Photocatalytic activity; Physicochemical properties; Reusability; Water pollution; Advanced Oxidation Processes; Broad application; Environmental remediation; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Heterogeneous photocatalysis; Magnetic nanocomposites; Magnetic photocatalysts; Metal free; Water purification; ]+ catalyst; Heterojunctions",Review,Scopus

Samples were characterized for their chemical, morphological, and structural properties. There was a significant content of Fe and S in both samples from the presence of iron sulfide. The average particle size is 10.9 μm for RPW and 7.4 μm for PPW, demonstrating that the beneficiation process could remove the larger quartz particles, interfered in the distribution, and average particle size. Smaller particle sizes promoted a larger surface area for the PPW. The influence of the pyritic waste in dosage, H2O2 concentration, and pH was evaluated, obtaining discoloration values above 95% for 0.5 g/L of pyritic waste, 2 g/L of H2O2, and pH 4.3 for both pyritic wastes. The degradation kinetics of the Reactive Blue 21 using the raw pyritic waste obtained a dye concentration removal above 93% in 90 min, with an iron release of 5.4 mg/L into the solution. Using PPW, the dye concentration removal was over 92% in 40 min, with the iron release of 15.5 mg/L into the solution. Discoloration rate for the PPW sample is 7 times greater than the rate obtained for RPW, indicating a faster decay rate for the purified sample. A decrease in discoloration efficiency is observed for PPW after 6 cycles of use, due to the higher concentration of iron leached into the medium. From the results, it was concluded that the raw pyritic waste has excellent potential for use as a catalyst for Fenton reaction, especially for dye-containing water discoloration, thus demonstrating the excellent applicability potential of pyritc waste in the degradation of organic pollutants in wastewater. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Discoloration; Fenton process; Reuse; Textile dyes; Waste valorization","Catalysts; Coal deposits; Degradation; Discoloration; Organic carbon; Oxidation; Particle size; Purification; Sulfur compounds; Water pollution; Water treatment; Average particle size; Coal-mining; Dye concentration; Fenton's process; Iron release; Reactive blues; Reuse; Textile dyes; Waste valorizations; ]+ catalyst; Organic pollutants; dye; iron; reactive blue 21; unclassified drug; hydrogen peroxide; metalloporphyrin; reactive blue 21; catalyst; coal mining; color; dye; purification; textile industry; valorization; Article; catalyst; coal mining; concentration (parameter); degradation kinetics; Fenton reaction; organic pollution; purification; pyritic waste; waste; waste valorization; wastewater; Brazil; Brazil; Coal Mining; Hydrogen Peroxide; Iron; Metalloporphyrins",Article,Scopus

The focus is on historical Italian healthcare buildings since these show widespread decay and neglect. A five-step methodology has been developed: Screening of public assets; classification, evaluation, and identification of buildings, based on the “potential index”; GIS mapping and inventory; selection of buildings for in-depth analysis; BIM digitization and definition of the “transformability index”. In the fifth phase, an evaluation tool is integrated into the BIM software to automatically calculate the transformability index of each building using six indicators: Usability, fragmentation, modifiability, roof implementation, external envelope, and window-to-wall ratio. The “transformability index” helps define the most appropriate buildings to intervene with for reuse. Building transformation is connected to construction features and layout organization and it is limited by architectural, structural, and artistic constraints. © 2022 by the authors.

We need to take a pragmatic and practical approach to the reuse of buildings, taking into account the embodied carbon savings we can make by reusing existing structures compared with building new. Not only will this look after our heritage, but it will also help to reduce the enormous carbon footprint of construction. This has to be the future approach of our profession and we need to make sure that it becomes embedded in the core competencies of structural engineers – not sometime in the future, but now. We need to normalise these changed attitudes and use them to engage with the unengaged, whether that be colleagues, clients or other members of our design teams. We may start with little steps, but as we become more agile in this way of thinking, these steps will become bigger and more effective. The Climate Emergency Task Group, whose articles in The Structural Engineer are essential reading, has set us targets of reducing our carbon footprint by 10% each year, so we must act now, not just plan to get started soon. Wherever we work as structural engineers, we need to put climate action at the top of our priorities; this has been done by this Institution in the decision made by the Board in 2019 to put the climate emergency on a par with the Institution’s existing strong focus on structural safety. This is not just for those working in large consultancies for wealthy clients, it is for all of us. In the words of John Wesley, ‘The World is my Parish’ – there are no boundaries, we must all play our part wherever we are and whoever we work for. Our previous President, Don McQuillan, spoke about the four Cs of Competence, Communities, Collaboration and Communication. Picking up on these, we need to make sure that our engineers, both current and future, are competent to fulfil their role in taking positive climate action. We do not have time to wait for them to all learn over three decades like me; we need to work as a community both at global and local level, to collaborate and communicate our knowledge and best practice.

This study investigates and compares which product design strategies (from routinely design, structural optimization, industrial design and systematic innovation) are most used by students and professional designers to implement different CE strategies (i.e., waste reduction, reuse, remanufacturing, recycling and biodegradability). Students’ data were collected from year projects and MSc degree theses based on real industrial case studies and carried out in two Italian engineering universities, while those of professional designers, were collected from selected scientific articles. Among the main outcomes emerged that the design strategies deriving from systematic innovation were preferred by students quite clearly. The design strategies referred to industrial design, e.g., user-centered design and timeless design were preferred by professional designers. The design strategies related to routine design, i.e., materials substitution, reducing resources and energy consumption, and structural optimization, were indistinctly used by both students and professional designers. The obtained results and their discussion can be useful during eco-design teaching to show the main gaps that students should fill in comparison with professional designers. © 2022 by the authors.

Moreover, PH-CPSF microspheres can also be used as adsorption fillers for large-scale water purification, and a removal rate of 94.0% for MB can be achieved under a flow rate of 8000 L m−3 h−1.

To clarify conflicting guidelines, this study provides a new improved method and investigates its applicability by comparing it to two approaches suggested in previous literature. The study investigates the effects of methodological choices by applying them in the life cycle assessment of three buildings with the same spatial layout but different structural solutions: business as usual, wooden structures, and hybrid building with structures designed for disassembly. The method was streamlined by focusing solely on the category of global warming potential and by using table values in life cycle stages that have minor role. The assessment shows that design-for-disassembly could be as powerful climate protection strategy as wooden structures. The main result of this study is the verification of a new secure method for assessing the design-for-disassembly components. The suggested approach would improve the applicability of life cycle assessment in a normative context by improving the consistency of assessment in the case of circular economy.

This study reports a new hierarchical structure with the monolithic integration of adhesion and sensing functions, namely, contact-sensible adhesive (CSA). The proposed CSA is composed of mushroom-shaped microstructures on the top layer for providing strong adhesion, and a pillar array sandwiched by a pair of foil electrodes on the bottom layer as a compliant backing and a capacitive sensor. The CSA is not only sensitive to the external pressure, tension, and shear loads, but also shows enhanced adhesion on uneven surfaces, due to the high compliance of the hierarchical system.

However, material flows in the building life cycle are difficult to map, especially those initiated by material replacements and at end-of-life. The calculation formula for the number of replacements in buildings in the Life Cycle Assessment standard EN 15978 neglects the effect such replacements may have on the surrounding interdependent building parts, and hence fails to capture the potential benefits of Design for Disassembly. In light of this shortcoming, we propose a method to model the flows of building parts initiated by the disassembly of a building, both during operational and end-of-life stages.

The silane-modified AuIDE surface was deposited with ∼20 nm diamond and enhanced the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NCP). The characteristics of chemically modified diamond were evidenced by structural analyses, revealing the cubic crystalline nature at (220) and (111) planes as observed by XRD. XPS analysis denotes a strong interaction of carbon element, composed ∼95% as seen in EDS analysis. The C–C, C[dbnd]C, C[dbnd]O, C[dbnd]N functional groups were well-refuted from XPS spectra of carbon and oxygen elements in diamond. The interrelation between elements through FTIR analysis indicates major intrinsic bondings at 2687-2031 cm−1.

The determination coefficients of R2 = 0.9759 and R2 = 0.9772 were obtained for aptamer- and antibody-based sensing, respectively. Moreover, the genuine interaction of NCP aptamer and protein was validated by enzyme linked apta-sorbent assay.

The impact of coexisting organics on the performance of carbonaceous catalysis was investigated in the continuous filtration mode. Reusability testing and radical quenching experiments revealed that the non-radical pathways of surface-activated persulfate mainly contributed to SMX degradation. A stable SMX removal flux (rSMX) of 22.15 mg m−2·h−1 was obtained in 24 h when tap water was filtered continuously under a low pressure of 1.78 bar and in a short contact time of 1.4 s, which was slightly lower than the rSMX of 23.03 mg m−2·h−1 performed with deionized water as the control group. In addition, higher contents of protein-, fulvic acid-, and humic acid-like organics resulted in membrane fouling and significantly suppressed SMX removal during long-term filtration. Changes in the production of sulfate ions and the Raman spectra of carbon mats indicated that organics prevent the structural defects of the carbon matrix from participating in PDS activation. Moreover, NG/rGO/CNTs composite membranes coupled with activated persulfate oxidation exhibited good self-cleaning ability, because membrane fouling could be partly reversed by restoring filtration pressure during operation. This study provides a novel and effective oxidation strategy for efficient SMX removal in water purification, allowing the application of carbonaceous catalysis for the selective degradation of emerging contaminants. © 2021","Carbonaceous composite membranes; In-situ catalytic oxidation; Non-radical pathway; Peroxydisulfate activation; Real water matrix; Sulfamethoxazole","Catalysis; Catalytic oxidation; Composite membranes; Deionized water; Doping (additives); Graphene; Membrane fouling; Microfiltration; Organic acids; Reusability; Sulfur compounds; Water filtration; Water pollution; Carbonaceous composite membrane; In-situ catalytic oxidation; Non-radical pathway; Organics; Peroxydisulfate; Peroxydisulphate activation; Radical pathway; Real water matrix; Sulfamethoxazole; Water matrices; Chemical activation; carbon nanotube; sulfamethoxazole; water; catalysis; filtration; Catalysis; Filtration; Nanotubes, Carbon; Sulfamethoxazole; Water",Article,Scopus

To realize the complementary advantages, the ionic interactions in the EMNa ensure the structural integrity and self-healing repeatability of the blends, meanwhile the highly elastic EMA as the dispersed phase is capable to provide the main driving force during the shape recovery process. The shape recovery behavior can be well controlled by varying the EMA content. The shape recovery time shortens with increasing EMA content, and a U-shaped EMNa with 30 wt% of EMA (EMNa/EMA-30) specimen could recover to a plate shape within 8 s. Interestingly, the EMNa/EMA-30 exhibits repeatable self-healing capability, and its tensile strength can reach 19.4 and 15.9 MPa after one and three healing cycles, respectively. The self-healed EMNa/EMA-30 still exhibits excellent reusability and endurance, and the shape fixity and shape recovery ratios are both above 95% after 15 shape memory cycles.

The method involves welding shear studs to the intact part of the web plate and encasing the end region in UHPC. This paper presents the findings of an experimental study on a full-scale girder aimed to assess the feasibility of rapid implementation of the repair. Reducing the construction complexities and time is critical in cases where access to the bridge is constrained or closing the bridge to traffic is not possible. To expedite and simplify repair construction, welded shear studs originally used to transfer loads to the UHPC cast were replaced with steel dowel rods. In place of conventional wooden formwork, a reusable flexible light-gauge sheet of steel was wrapped around the end. Installation of the shear connectors, installation of the form, and casting of the UHPC was completed by two workers within an eight-hour shift. The repaired girder was load tested after the UHPC gained a compressive strength of 96.5 MPa to demonstrate the adequacy of the repair for restoring the capacity of the intact girder end shortly after implementation.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on a quantitative survey, a cross-sectional study of households was conducted. Data from 652 respondents were collected using structured questionnaires and analysed with partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: Among the findings, environmental values was the major influencer of pro-environmental intentions, accounting for 54.8% of its variance. Whilst pro-environmental intention was hypothesised as a key predictor of sustainable waste management behaviours, results showed that sustainable e-waste management is mainly influenced by perceived behavioural control (β = 0.546, p = 0.000), followed by pro-environmental intentions (β = 0.302, p = 0.000). Perceived behavioural control, on the other hand, was influenced by perceived producer responsibility (β = 0.340, p = 0.000) and facilitating conditions (β = 0.141, p = 0.0.034). Research limitations/implications: First, the study used a quantitative approach. The use of a mixed-methods approach could provide deeper insights into the determinants of sustainable e-waste management practices in a specific cultural context. Also due to the quantitative nature of the study, sustainable e-waste management was based on self-reports. Future studies may adopt longitudinal studies to validate self-reported behaviours with observation. Finally, the study does not include all constructs proposed by planned behaviour and norm activation theory. This is because the main aim of the study was to examine perceived behavioural control as an extrinsic motivator and environmental values as an intrinsic motivator to engage in sustainable waste management practices. Practical implications: Waste is best managed at source, so the study recommends that producers of electronic equipment must reconsider their role in sustainable waste management, by taking physical and economic responsibility for the environmental costs of their products. Pro-environmental intentions must be encouraged; however, it is not sufficient to cause sustainable waste management behaviours. Consequently, governments must promote and encourage sustainable e-waste management among households by providing enabling policy conditions such as convenient e-waste collection points and positively reinforcing waste reduction, reuse and recycling behaviours. Also, a culture of environmental conservation should be encouraged among households. Originality/value: The study explores the role of environmental values and perceived behavioural control as a source of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to engage in sustainable e-waste management. The inclusion of facilitating conditions and perceived producer responsibility is justified, based on the call for a collective approach towards electronic waste management. The results of the study throw more light on the tri-party approach, specifically, consumers, business and government role in developing and maintaining a sustainable approach towards the management of electronic waste in Ghana. Also, the study integrates planned behaviour and norm activation based on the strong sustainability argument. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Circular economy; Developing economy; Environmental values; Households; Pro-environmental intentions; Producer responsibility; Sustainable e-waste management","economic development; electronic waste; environmental values; recycling; sustainability; sustainable development; waste disposal; waste management",Article,Scopus

The kaolin waste showed kaolinite and quartz in its composition, while the heat treatment at 1200◦ C modified it to mullite, quartz and silica-rich amorphous phase. By XRD, there was an increase in the intensity of the peak 2θ = 23.9◦ of the PCL/KW composites compared to neat PCL. In contrast, PCL/HTKW composites tended to reduce the intensity of the peak 2θ = 23.9◦, especially at 5 % HTKW. The crystalline melting temperature and the degree of crystallinity of PCL/KW and PCL/HTKW composites were practically unchanged, compared to PCL. However, the crystallization process was more effective with the kaolin waste (KW) without heat treatment, indicating that the HTKW amorphous phase inhibited crystallization. The PCL/KW development promoted an increase in crystallization temperature, relative crystallinity, and crystallization rate, surpassing PCL and the PCL/HTKW system. In view of this, kaolin waste has the potential to accelerate the PCL crystallization process, contributing to add value to a material that would otherwise be discarded and minimizing environmental impacts. © 2022, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

Many of these structures are still in service today, and due to increasing costs associated with the replacement of existing buildings, repair, and rehabilitation of these structures has become economically attractive. The reuse of bowstring trusses requires careful engineering assessment of their ability to continue to perform safely under applicable building code requirements. Successful assessment of in-place structural capacity requires a thorough investigation of existing conditions and a realistic structural analysis. This paper discusses the process of establishing design values for timber members in existing structures (visual stress grading) as well as considerations and methods to create finite element models that accurately represent the behavior of bowstring trusses. By using a realistic structural model, the engineer can better understand structural behavior, which will guide the process of selecting efficient rehabilitation options. © Forensic Engineering 2022: Elevating Forensic Engineering - Selected Papers from the 9th Congress on Forensic Engineering.All rights reserved.",,"Forensic engineering; Grading; Structural analysis; Code requirements; Condition; Design value; Engineering assessments; In-buildings; Increasing costs; Repair and rehabilitations; Reuse; Structural capacities; Structural solutions; Trusses",Conference Paper,Scopus

Therefore, it is necessary to extract a constructional frameset of heterogeneous models based on a unified modeling language. This paper presents a method of constructional frameset extraction and feature quantization to address the issues of matching, classification, and composition of multi-domain heterogeneous models. Firstly, heterogeneous models are converted into unified models, which are described by X language. Then, the structural features of each X model are extracted to be incorporated into a predefined template. Then the template can be quantified in the form of a binary tree. The sequence obtained by inorder transversal of the binary tree can be a quantified feature of the template. All the model templates make up the constructional frameset of multi-domain heterogeneous models. The results show that the proposed method can abstract the features of multi-domain heterogeneous models and support a constructional frameset library to rapid modeling, integration, and reuse. © 2022 SPIE.","binary tree; constructional frameset; heterogeneous models; model features; model reuse","Computer simulation languages; Image processing; Unified Modeling Language; Constructional frameset; Field application; Heterogeneous modelling; Model reuse; Model-based OPC; Modeling features; Modelling and simulation technologies; Multi-domains; Quantification methods; Reuse; Binary trees",Conference Paper,Scopus

Adding nano-CaCO3 to the network structure of the polymer not only provided pores to the sorbent but also enhanced its sorption capacity towards various oils and toxic organic solvents. The nanocomposite sorbent exhibited excellent absorption capacity for different toxic organic solvents and oils and great reusability for ten cycles. Moreover, the obtained sorbent material selectively absorbed organic liquids from the surface and bottom of the water without any capacity change owing to their hydrophobicity and oleophilicity.

The general rationale is to improve efficiency by not doing redundant work. For this purpose, summaries of function blocks are cached and reused to benefit from the previous analysis.

In this contribution, we proposed a ""two-solvent system of water and glycerol"" strategy to achieve the complete miscibility of monomers and we designed a cross-linked network structure to effectively improve the mechanical strength and reusability of the adsorbent. Morphological and structural characterization of the amidoxime cross-linked polyacrylonitrile microspheres (H-CAN) showed that these particles present a spherical structure with diameter of 200–300 nm, the expected cross-linked structure, and amorphous properties. The adsorption performance of H-CAN was investigated under different conditions of contact time, pH and temperature. The time to reach adsorption equilibrium at pH 7 and temperature 25 °C was 60 min (Cu (II)) and 40 min (Pb (II)), respectively. The results were in accordance with the Langmuir model, which showed the maximum adsorption of 140.33 and 113.13 mg·g−1 for Cu (II) and Pb (II), respectively. Moreover, the adsorption capacity after seven repetitions was 89.5% (Cu (II)) and 91.0% (Pb (II)) of the initial values.

For this, the synthesized atomically thin AuNSs are functionalized with thiolated poly(ethylene glycol) (SH-PEG) followed by encapsulation in silica layers of different thicknesses using different amounts of tetraethyl orthosilicate. The UV-ozone treatment removes the PEG molecules within the silica layers to form AuNS@pSiO2. The AuNS@pSiO2 shows structural stability in dried powder form while the as-prepared AuNSs aggregate and merge immediately after being dried into a powder. The AuNS@pSiO2 exhibits superior catalytic activity with a normalized rate constant of 8.8 × 104 min−1 gAu−1 compared to the previously reported porous silica-encapsulated gold nanostructures for the 4-NPh reduction reaction. In addition, the AuNS@pSiO2 shows excellent catalytic stability compared to the as-prepared AuNSs during the reusability test at 60 °C.

Alternatives considered included removal of the organic soil and replacing with a thick stone pad, ground improvement, and pile foundations.

Several active- and passive solutions and strategies have been developed and proposed in the literature. Among them, wood is highlighted as a promising solution to minimize GHG from buildings. However, the benefits, especially in the circular economy, are not fully evaluated due to methodological choices. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this article aims to evaluate the benefits of wood reuse compared to traditional building construction solutions. For this purpose, we have calculated the environmental impacts of a building situated in Graz, Austria. Four different scenarios are considered. The first scenario is a fully reinforced concrete building. The second scenario is a structural beam-column made from reinforced concrete with walls made of concrete blocks. The third scenario is a beam-column made from reinforced concrete with external walls based on clay blocks. Finally, the last scenario is a full wooden building. Following the standardized life cycle assessment (LCA) method, global warming potential (GWP) is calculated through a 0/0 approach. These evaluations were made possible by correlating the impacts released from producing wooden elements and the uptake of biogenic carbon from the forest. Without considering the possibility of material reuse, the wooden structure has a 5 % lower GWP value than the reinforced concrete building. Comparatively, the other building scenarios have almost similar impacts as the building in reinforced concrete. In the case of material reuse, the wooden structure building shows potential to develop projects with 44% lower environmental impacts. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

By contrasting their building-specific features, it demonstrates the benefits and drawbacks of particular structural elements and envelope solutions and ecological aspects using various system boundaries of life-cycle assessment (LCA). Following a careful consideration of ecological factors and sustainable circular economy criteria, a structural component that is sustainably optimized is defined. This component should be chosen based on external conditions. By selecting environmentally friendly building materials and proper connecting procedures that enable separability, resource-efficient and sustainable buildings can be achieved. Both the selection of load-bearing elements and the necessary insulating material have a significant impact on the ecological performance and reusability options of the components. The elements of homogeneity, separability, and pollutantfreeness play a significant influence in the reuse process, namely in terms of details and construction type in general, as well as the ways of reusing and recycling them. Sustainable solutions for load-bearing building components can be created by simultaneously investigating environmentally friendly building materials and the structure of the components. This paper illustrates how the natural resources can be used both optimally and sustainably. It presents a conceptual framework for scenario development of the LCA of load-bearing structures, their effect on the design and decision-making process. There is a potential of increasing total resource efficiency at the building level with a suitable combination of the material components employed at the component level. Because of this, the overall energy efficiency and its consequent ecological impacts are the main topics of this study. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

A major perpetrator of resource and material waste is the building sector. A lot of research results already provide innovative technologies and solutions for circular construction. However, what many of the circular economy initiatives in the construction sector have in common, is a certain malaise in moving from pilot projects with high individual engagement to actions on a larger scale. Prefabricated timber construction is one of the most promising key technologies towards a more resource efficient Europe. Despite this potential, downcycling or an early thermic utilization is common practice. Valuable resources are wasted and already captured CO2 is released. The research project circularWOOD aims to provide a better understanding for potentials and barriers in a first step. This paper outlines first findings. Prefabrication and element design facilitate circular construction approaches. The context in which stakeholder implement circular construction approaches is widened. A wide range of economic and ecological aspects is supplemented with cultural, political, and regulatory conditions. Under the premise of reuse with a minimum of necessary adaptation structural aspects are evaluated. The results show a current concentration on new construction with easy-to-implement design approaches. Further efforts towards strategies for the reuse of existing construction and experiences to facilitate the diffusion within the timber construction sector are required. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, designing interlocking assemblies is a highly challenging task because of the global nature of the interlocking property.

To eliminate these pollutants, a high-performing nanofiltration (NF) membrane was prepared by blending the functionalized mesoporous carbon CMK-5 (F-CMK-5) nanofiller. This membrane was synthesized by introducing the active groups of sulfonyl and amide to the surface of mesoporous carbon CMK-5 through covalent functionalization. Characterizations were conducted to study the membranes' physical properties and separation performance in terms of antifouling properties and rejection of salts, heavy metal ions, and dyes. The interactions between the active sites of the nanocomposite membrane and the studied solutes, including dyes and heavy metal ions in aqueous solutions, were studied by the density functional based tight binding method and structural optimization was carried out. Insertion of the F-CMK-5 nanofiller was eventuated in a remarkable increase in surface hydrophilicity, pure water flux, and antifouling properties. For all membranes, the lowest and the highest salt rejection was obtained for NaCl and Na2SO4, respectively, exhibiting the characteristics of NF membranes. Moreover, M0.3 with 0.3 wt% nanofiller showed the highest rejection for heavy metal ions (Fe2+ = 99.9%, Zn2+ = 99.9%, Cu2+ = 99.7%, and Pb2+ = 99.2%) and dyes (RB5 = 99.21, DR16 = 98.87, and MB = 98.12%), as well as high separation performance for filtration of multipollutant solutions.

In the experimental setup the HTT panel uses only a small section of the actual combustion chamber geometry, typically five cooling channels. The panel is heated by a high power diode laser providing realistic amounts of heat flux. For safety and cost reasons supercritical nitrogen is used as coolant instead of hydrogen or methane. Within the experiment different combinations of surface temperature, heat flux and mass flow rate were examined, in total 24 different test conditions.

ANSYS CFX was used to analyze the nitrogen coolant fluid flow with a Shear Stress Turbulence (SST) model. ANSYS Mechanical was used for the thermal finite element analysis. The relevant thermophysical parameters like heat conductivity, diffusivity and heat capacity were measured for temperatures above 273 K.

The construction/manufacturing, food, and mobility industries are the three biggest GHG emitters, possessing a high concentration of people and using most resources and capital. Consequently, identifying various opportunities in applying the CE concept in these sectors is also discussed. The government's role is another crucial factor in motivating businesses to implement the CE concept through numerous enabling policies, such as incentivization, to reduce GHG emissions, and funnelling investments.

To satisfy the first perspective, composites materials are being increasingly used to produce lightweight structural and semi-structural components. However, the automotive mass production arises the problem of the end-of-life disposal of the vehicle and the reduction of the wastes environmental impact. The circular economy of the composite materials has therefore become a challenge of primary importance for car manufacturers and tier 1 suppliers. It is necessary to pursue a different economic model, combining traditional raw materials with the intensive use of materials from recycling processes. New technologies are being studied and developed concerning the reuse of in-line production scraps with out-of-autoclave process that makes them desirable for high production rate applications. In this frame, a methodology for the reuse of prepreg cutouts coming from in-line ply cutting process is proposed. Production cutouts (scraps, or chops) are used as a charge to manufacture components through the compression molding process. The structure of the final part keeps in meso-scale the same orthotropic orientation of the chops, although it is quasi-isotropic from a macroscopic point of view. Accordingly, standard three-point bending, and tensile mechanical tests were performed to characterize the mechanical behavior of the material. Failure modes and fracture propagation were analyzed too. The chop interface resulted to affect the mechanical performance. Before material failure, multiple damage precursor sites nucleated, generally in correspondence of the chop interfaces. Delamination, brittle fracture of the matrix and debonding between the chops were the main failure modes. The results of the standard coupon tests evidenced good performance of the material in terms of strength and stiffness, despite lower than standard 2x2 twill structure, making the studied material suitable for semi-structural purposes. Accordingly, a prototype of an accelerator pedal frame was produced, in order to evaluate the feasibility, the potential limitations and the aspects to be optimized for the manufacturing of a more complex component. ©",,"Automotive industry; Bending tests; Compression molding; Emission control; Waste disposal; Automotive sector; Automotives; Circular economy; Composites material; Emission reduction; End of lives; Lightweight components; Mass production; Reuse; Structural component; Interfaces (materials)",Conference Paper,Scopus

The circular economy (CE) principles have gained significant attention among researchers and practitioners to help overcome these challenges. Construction materials such as timber and steel elements will lend themselves more easily to reuse and recycle for new construction to reduce carbon emissions. The BIM-based LCA method could be explored and expanded to evaluate design options for circular construction to advance the knowledge about implementing circular economy principles in construction projects. However, this is relatively new and requires proof of concepts to demonstrate precisely how BIM-based LCA could be implemented to help stakeholders decide on optimal design options and material choices. To address this need, this study proposes a BIM-based LCA process for comparing the carbon impact of two design model options considering different material choices, including the possibilities of using virgin materials and recycled and reused materials. Findings show that the timber structure was favored over the precast concrete structure because timber materials entailed less carbon emission; however, the precast concrete structure has great potential of being reused for future new construction projects.

The MSC technique provides insight into the impact of its many factors. Microwave irradiation is utilized in this method to retain precursors in an excited state and make them highly reactive. This technique is usually carried out using a Raga's scientific microwave reactor with a frequency of 2.45 GHz, T = 100°C. Metal nitrates (precursers) and Urea are the most often utilized preparation for nanomaterials. Because of its high-temperature range or propellant combustion requirements, urea is the most used fuel. To accomplish a quicker and better yield product, many factors such as fuel to oxidizer ratio, irradiation period, microwave power, temperature and pressure may be tuned. This procedure does not require any additional calcination; however, it does necessitate numerous washing steps to purify the final result. The 4000–400 cm−1 peaks were examined in the composition characterization of spinel ferrites using FTIR findings. The focus of the research was to find a MgFe2O4 spinel with a Magnesium A-site in Ferrite particles. This study is to explore catalyst behaviour in sessions of structural, compositional, crystallinity, and magnetic stability with neodymium magnets used for the separation of RB21 dye from synthetic wastewater. To check the reusability at 20 mg catalyst dosage at 20 mg/L dye concentration which gives 4 runs efficiency 90% − 66% observed. © 2023","Dyes; Ferrites Spinel; Microwave Solution Combustion method; Visible light; Wastewater treatment","Combustion; Crystallinity; Energy efficiency; Excited states; Ferrite; Iron compounds; Irradiation; Light; Magnesium compounds; Metabolism; Microwave irradiation; Reusability; Sols; Urea; Dye degradation; Electrical devices; Ferrites spinel; Microwave solution combustion method; Sol'gel; Solution combustion method; Solution combustion process; Spinel ferrites; Visible light; Visible-light responsive photocatalysts; Wastewater treatment",Article,Scopus

Coarse coal gangue is an important solid waste in the mining industry. In India, the annual deposition of coal gangue is about 50 to 60 tons. Large numbers of research work are being carried out intensely to find a feasible way to reuse the coarse coal gangue in concrete thereby reducing the environmental hazard. This paper reports the workability, compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength, shrinkage, sorptivity, and thermal conductivity of structural concrete. Coal gangue as replacement of coarse aggregate and nano-silica as partial replacement of cement was used in this study. The natural Coarse Aggregate (CA) was replaced by Coarse Coal Gangue Aggregate (CCGA) at 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 % by weight of coarse aggregate and cement was replaced by Nano-Silica (NS) at 0 %, 2 %, and 3 % by weight of cement. The water to binder ratio was maintained as 0.45. In order to avoid workability reduction during replacement of nano-silica, Naphthalene-based superplasticizer Sulfonated Naphthalene Formaldehyde (SNF) was used to maintain the workability of concrete. The objective of the study is to establish the optimal content of NS and CCGA in the structural concrete with better strength and performance. The test results were compared with conventional M30 grade concrete. Totally 15 different mixes were studied and their test results were interpreted in this paper. The study revealed that cement replacement by 2 % NS by its weight and NA replacement by CCGA at 25 % by its weight showed improved mechanical properties like compressive strength, split tensile strength, and flexural strength. Hence the optimum use of NS and CCGA not improves the strength of concrete but also address the potential way of disposing CCGA. © 2022","Coarse coal gangue; Compressive strength; Nano silica; Thermal conductivity; Workability","Bending strength; Coal; Coal industry; Compressive strength; Concrete aggregates; Naphthalene; Shrinkage; Silica; Tensile strength; Thermal conductivity; Coal gangues; Coarse aggregates; Coarse coal gangue; Environmental hazards; Nano Silica; Property; Reuse; Split tensile strengths; Structural concretes; Workability; Cements",Article,Scopus

The optical properties and intense absorption edge of Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3/(BiO)4CO3(OH)2 reveal the proper visible light absorbing ability. The photocatalytic performance of the sample is investigated via the degradation of methylene orange (MeO) and rhodamine B (RB) under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic activity of Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3/(BiO)4CO3(OH)2 is compared with the synthesized sample in water, Bi2O3/Bi/Bi(OH)3, which exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity. Also, the stable photodegradation efficiency of Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3/(BiO)4CO3(OH)2 after four cycles reveals the long-term stability and reusability of the synthesized photocatalyst. The PL intensity of Bi2O3/Bi2O2CO3/(BiO)4CO3(OH)2 shows an improved separation rate of electron–hole pairs and so enhanced photocatalytic performance. The improved photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to the formation of multi-heterojunctions, flake morphology and intrinsic internal electric field (IEF). Multi-heterojunction nanoflakes enhance the absorbance of visible light and facilitate the separation and transport of photogenerated electron holes through large IEF.

Residual mechanical properties of CFS sections exposed to elevated temperature need to be investigated as it is necessary to predict the deterioration of elements to avoid failure of the structure or its elements. Also, it would be helpful to decide whether the structural elements need to be replaced or reused. The use of fire-resistant coatings in steel structures significantly reduces the cost of repairing structural elements and also the probability of collapse. This study investigates the effect of fire-resistant coating on post-fire residual mechanical properties of E350 steel grade. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, an attempt has been made to evaluate the residual mechanical properties of E350 steel. A tensile coupon test was performed for the extracted specimens from the exposed CFS section to determine the mechanical properties. Four different fire-resistant coatings were selected and the sections were coated and heated as per ISO 834 fire temperature curve in the transient state for time durations of 30 minutes (821°C), 60 minutes (925°C), 90 minutes (986°C), and 120 minutes (1,029°C). After the exposure, all the coupon specimens were cooled by either ambient conditions (natural air) or water spraying before conducting the tension test on these specimens. Findings: At 30 min exposure, the reduction in yield and ultimate strength of heated specimens was about 20 and 25% for air and water-cooled specimens compared with reference specimens. Specimens coated with vermiculite and perlite exhibited higher residual mechanical property up to 60 minutes than other coated specimens for both cooling conditions. Generally, water-cooled specimens had shown higher strength loss than air-cooled specimens. Specimens coated with vermiculite and perlite showed an excellent performance than other specimens coated with zinc and gypsum for all heating durations. Originality/value: As CFS structures are widely used in construction practices, it is crucial to study the mechanical properties of CFS under post-fire conditions. This investigation provides detailed information about the physical and mechanical characteristics of E350 steel coated with different types of fire protection materials after exposure to elevated temperatures. An attempt has been made to improve the residual properties of CFS using the appropriate coatings. The outcome of the present study may enable the practicing engineers to select the appropriate coating for protecting and enhancing the service life of CFS structures under extreme fire conditions. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Cold-formed steel; E350 steel; Elevated temperature; Fire resistance coating; Water cooling; Yield strength","Coatings; Cooling; Cooling water; Deterioration; Failure (mechanical); Fire protection; Fire resistance; Fires; Steel structures; Studs (structural members); Tensile testing; Yield stress; Cold formed steel section; Cold-formed steel; E350 steel; Elevated temperature; Exposed to; Fire resistance coating; Fire resistant coatings; Physical characteristics; Structural elements; Water cooling; Office buildings",Article,Scopus

A commercial office development built in the late 1990s in the London West End, 1 Triton Square had been designed to height limits which were no longer relevant when the tenant vacated the premises at the end of a twenty-year lease. When the building owner approached Arup to examine the possibility of enhancing the value of their asset, it was decided, instead of designing a taller new build, to develop a refurbishment and extension scheme, in line with both organisations' low-carbon agenda. The proposed scheme included the part-infilling of existing atria and the addition of three new levels, thus increasing the number of storeys from six to nine, and the floor area by 70%. Columns and foundations had to be strengthened to cater for the resulting uplift in loading. The original structure was predominantly a concrete frame, with steel-framed cores. Due to this variety of structural forms as well as to access constraints, a palette of strengthening methods was implemented, including concrete encasement and fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) wrapping for concrete columns, and concrete encasement and welding of strengthening plates for steel columns. Existing piled foundations were strengthened with small-diameter supplementary piles installed from within the existing basement and connected to them within new pile caps or within a new piled raft, depending on locations. 1 Triton Square has been completed in May 2021, achieving BREEAM Outstanding rating. The structural embodied carbon associated with the redeveloped scheme has been estimated at 136 kgCO2e/m2, to be compared to the October 2020 “best-practice” target of 350 kgCO2e/m2 for a new build, thus demonstrating the pivotal role of structural reuse in reducing carbon emissions. © 2022 IABSE Symposium Prague, 2022: Challenges for Existing and Oncoming Structures - Report.

Structural, optical, and magnetic properties of the nanocomposite were evaluated using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), Raman spectroscopy and BET surface analysis. The catalytic reduction of nitrophenols and nitroanilines was studied at room temperature to investigate the catalytic activity of the Ag@NiFe2O4/MIL101(Fe) nanocomposite. The results showed that the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (0.2 mM) in the presence of Ag(25 wt%)@NiFe2O4/MIL101(Fe) and NaBH4 (20 mM) as a green reducing agent was completed within 3 min, and the Ag@NiFe2O4/MIL101(Fe) ternary nanocomposite has a very effective performance in the conversion of these contaminants. In addition, the relatively high specific surface area of MIL-101(Fe), the magnetic properties of NiFe2O4 and the effect of silver nanoparticles increase the synergy and increase the removal efficiency of nitroaromatic pollutants. The fabricated composite containing 25 wt% of Ag demonstrated superior catalytic performance over other composites. The ternary magnetic catalyst can be easily separated from the reaction medium using an external magnetic field. The recycled nanocatalyst was used again after separation and washing. After 5 uses, the synthesized nanocomposite maintained its efficiency as a catalyst in reducing nitro-aromatic compounds by 100%, which shows the high stability of the catalyst. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry",,"Catalyst activity; Field emission microscopes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Magnetic properties; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocatalysts; Nanocomposites; Nanomagnetics; Nickel compounds; Organometallics; Phenols; Reusability; Room temperature; Scanning electron microscopy; Silver nanoparticles; Sodium Borohydride; Surface analysis; Catalytic reduction; Fe metal; Magnetic nanocomposites; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Nitroanilines; Nitrophenols; Synthesised; UV-visible; X- ray diffractions; ]+ catalyst; Iron compounds",Article,Scopus

The objective of that effort was to provide capsule decelerator options that fulfilled two relatively unique safety-based requirements for a human rated spacecraft. These requirements; being able to sustain two complete subsystem component failures and incorporating two separate and independent decelerator technologies drove distinctive design decisions throughout the project. This paper addresses the impact and influence of those unique requirements on the primary decelerator subsystem and then captures the resulting decelerator technology configuration.

The main objective of this investigation is to overview the various studies carried out to reuse the waste materials like electroplating sludge, fly ash, etc. For the development of construction materials. This paper summarizes the use of polymers in composite material formulations for the development of building materials such as lightweight concrete, protective coatings, paver blocks, bricks, and structural components. Different tests, namely viscosity, density, flash point, amine value, and epoxy equivalent weight, were performed on polymers to find their suitability as binder materials. Various laboratory tests such as compressive strength, water absorption, tear resistance, flexural strength, and split tensile tests were carried out to determine the mechanical properties of the developed materials. By using polymers with the addition of sustainable filler and waste materials, the replacement of costly raw material can be achieved by more than 50% in the case of paver blocks, up to 60% in bitumen-polymer composite, 80% in case of lightweight concrete and polymer-based panels.

Microscopic and spectroscopic techniques of synthesized nanocomposite revealed the high crystallinity and particle size in nanorange. The TiO2-CdS nanocomposite showed maximum degradation (CR 95%; RB 93%) at minimum concentration of pollutant (25 mgL−1) with catalytic dose (15 mg) and at neutral pH within 5 h.

The presence of active radicals during the photocatalysis process caused rapid degradation, which was backed up by scavenger analysis. The breakdown of harmful contaminants into safer metabolites, which were then mineralized, was demonstrated by GC–MS analysis.

However, the existing wastewater treatment and reuse scenarios are not adequately connected, leading to the release of treated effluent into the river system. This study was conducted for identification of the critical factors that can influence the feasibility of implementing an integrated municipal wastewater treatment and reuse (IMWTR) network and establish interrelationships between them. Firstly, by literature review, 22 potential factors were identified, out of which 12 key influencing factors were distilled by compiling responses of experts from the field of environmental engineering. Secondly, using interpretive structural modelling, an eight-level hierarchical structure was formed for establishing interrelationships between the identified factors. Thirdly, the identified key factors' driving power and dependence power were used to classify the factors into four groups, namely autonomous, linkage, dependent, and driving factors, using the Matrix of Cross Impact—Multiplications Applied to Classification analysis. Finally, strategies were suggested for environmentally sustainable and economically feasible implementation of an IMWTR network. In this paper, it was observed that social acceptance of reclaimed water and the definition of proper policies, and their regulation play the most crucial role in the implementation of an IMWTR network.

To achieve this goal, the residual performance of used steel must be evaluated. For seismic areas, the residual performance after experiencing an earthquake, large or small, must be quantified. Therefore, the residual performance of hot rolled I-shapes, of grades SS400, SN400B and SN490B, after plastic deformation and strain aging was examined through three test series: (I) tension coupon tests; (II) cyclic tension-and-compression coupon tests; and (III) cyclically loaded beam tests. The tests were conducted in two phases: pre loading to predetermined plastic deformation, and subsequently, after curing for 1 or 3 months at ambient temperature, loading to larger plastic deformation. The SS400 with free nitrogen content of 0.006 wt% saw substantial strain aging effects, while SN400B and SN490B with free nitrogen content of 0.003 and 0.002 wt% saw smaller effects. In the beam tests, pre-loading to ±0.02 rad resulted in up to 25% increase in yield strength but little change in maximum strength and plastic deformation capacity.

Owing to the clustering issue being NP-hard, evolutionary methods like the genetic algorithm were utilized to address it. There is no search-based technique for modularization that uses a hierarchical method in the structural refactoring literature.

The kinetics of the adsorption process were investigated using pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetic models, while the thermodynamics were assessed using Langmuir, Freundlich, Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) and Temkin thermodynamic models. The Langmuir isotherm was best fit to experimental data for adsorption of Cu (II) ions from an aqueous solution with a maximum adsorption capacity of 85.05 mg g−1 at pH 7.0 at different temperatures, whereas kinetic adsorption characteristics were best suited to the pseudo-second-order model.

The current study analyzes recycled aggregate materials' basic properties from construction and demolition waste and identifies drawbacks while using excessive amounts. The volume of recycled aggregate materials used to replace natural aggregate materials in concrete production ranged from 0% to 100% to evaluate the suitability range in the current study. Evaluations have been done on the fundamental properties such as workability and strength performance of concrete materials for the M20 mix design, ranging from 0% to 100% replacement of recycled and natural aggregate material. While doing practical tests using various replacement rates, the conventional aggregate materials outperformed the concrete materials that incorporate recycled aggregate materials from construction and demolition debris. Based on the results obtained on investigations, a reduction in performance has been observed in almost all the basic properties of the concrete materials that contain recycled aggregate materials. Hence, most of the basic properties have been impacted by the increasing amount of recycled aggregate materials. So, it is not recommended to use recycled aggregate materials in excessive volume only to save materials. Of course, these materials' utilization will help us create a waste-free environment and have economic benefits. Still, the negative impacts must also be considered while using such materials in structural and foundation works. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the reuse of organic wastes in coatings like plasters and renders has been poorly studied. This paper shows the effect of tire rubber wastes on the mechanical properties and fire performance of gypsum plasters. The rubber waste was added to the mixture in mass percentages of 14.50% (C1) and 46.60% (C2). Flexural and compressive strength of plasters made with rubber wastes was visibly reduced as well as their surface hardness (Shore C). In addition, fire tests produced major damages through the entire 2 cm thickness of samples containing rubber wastes, as it was corroborated by X ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The heat transfer due to fire exposure modified considerably the chemical composition of plasters, since, on the non-exposed face to fire, the amount of gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) equivalent to mass loss obtained by TG due to water released by these plasters made with rubber wastes, was 5.4-7.2 lower than that of conventional plasters. The results suggest that certain wastes may reduce the efficiency of gypsum plasters in protecting underneath construction and structural elements against fire. ©2022 CSIC.","Fire; Gypsum; Passive protection; Temperature; Tire rubber waste","Coatings; Fire extinguishers; Fire protection; Fires; Heat transfer; Plaster; Thermogravimetric analysis; Tires; Construction elements; Fire behaviour; Fire performance; Inorganics; Organic wastes; Passive protection; Reuse; Structural elements; Tyre rubber wastes; Gypsum",Article,Scopus

To achieve high detection accuracy, most of the existing CNN-based methods leverage complex off-the-shelf CNN models for optical imagery. Unfortunately, this usually leads to expensive computational cost, which is hard to process in real time using resource-constrained devices deployed in the harsh satellite environment. In this article, we propose OSCAR-RT, the first end-to-end algorithm/hardware codesign framework for real-time on-satellite CNN-based SAR ship detection, which can simultaneously produce an accurate and hardware-friendly CNN model and an ultraefficient field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware accelerator that can be deployed on satellites. With the real-time on-satellite processing speed in mind, we start from a state-of-the-art compact CNN model for optical imagery. To eliminate the sharp decrease in the detection accuracy for SAR imagery, we analyze the discrepancy between the SAR domain and optical domain and propose to adapt the model by adjusting the output feature size to better detect relatively smaller objects in SAR imagery. To improve the detection speed, we propose to develop a fully pipelined interlayer streaming accelerator architecture, where all the layers of the CNN model can be concurrently processed using on-chip FPGA resources. To achieve this architecture, we first propose a hardware-guided, progressive, and structural pruning strategy, which is guided by our modeled hardware metrics and applies state-of-the-art coarse-grained and fine-grained filter pruning as well as mixed-precision quantization techniques. Moreover, to improve the reusability and portability of the hardware accelerator design, we develop a library of highly optimized CNN components in high-level synthesis, together with their performance and resource models. Finally, we map the pruned CNN model onto these hardware library components in a fully pipelined interlayer streaming fashion, by adjusting their parallelism factors to balance the execution of each layer and fit into the resource constraint. Experimental results using the adapted MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2, and SqueezeNet models on the widely used SAR ship detection dataset (SSDD) demonstrate the effectiveness of OSCAR-RT; for the MobileNetV1 model, it achieves an average precision of 94%, a detection speed of 652 frames/s on the Xilinx VC709 FPGA evaluation board while consuming about 5.8-W power. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Algorithm/hardware codesign; convolutional neural network~(CNN) acceleration; hardware-guided pruning; ship detection; synthetic aperture radar~(SAR) imagery","Convolution; Feature extraction; Image enhancement; Integrated circuit design; Network architecture; Neural networks; Object detection; Radar imaging; Reusability; Satellite imagery; Ships; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Tracking radar; Adaptation models; Algorithm/hardware co-design; Co-designs; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network acceleration; Features extraction; Hardware-guided pruning; Marine vehicles; Radar polarimetry; Ship detection; Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); algorithm; artificial neural network; detection method; remote sensing; satellite data; synthetic aperture radar",Article,Scopus

This method is based on the application of physical-mechanical processes that allow to obtain new quality products: Recycled aggregates, microfiltered water and cement sludge. Specifically, by means of a mechanical system equipped with buffer and Archimedes screws, fine (d < 5 mm) and coarse (d > 5 mm) aggregates are obtained. The water coming from the washing process is sent to a microfiltration process, where a filter membrane separates the liquid phase (microfiltered water) from the solid phase (cement sludge) and no type of potentially toxic additive is added. In this context, this paper investigates the feasibility of using all these components as new raw materials for sustainable concrete production. In particular, according to the requirements imposed by technical standards, an experimental program was developed, aimed at evaluating the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of the analyzed materials. The results showed that both recycled aggregates, the microfiltered water and the cement sludge can be used to produce new structural concrete. In particular, it was proven that also the cement sludge, which generally represents the most critical component destined for disposal, can be reused as filler in the partial replacement of sand. © 2022 by the authors.

In this work, HTS-1 has been successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal crystallization method using the C-SiO2 composite as both silicon source and mesoporous template, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide as microporous template, and tetrabutylorthotitanate as titanium source. The C-SiO2 composite is obtained by mild carbonization of the SiO2/T-40 (Tween 40) xerogel, which is prepared by the two step sol-gel method. The reaction conditions for the oxidative desulfurization (ODS) of dibenzothiophene (DBT) and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) over HTS-1 are optimized systematically, and the recycling performances of HTS-1 are investigated in detail. After the 15th run, HTS-1 still maintains high DBT conversion (90.6%) and 4,6-DMDBT conversion (86.0%) without deactivation. The samples before and after recycle tests are characterized by XRD, FT-IR, CHN analysis, UV-Vis and SEM techniques. The results indicate that the crystal structure and morphology of regenerated HTS-1 samples are well kept, which accounts for the good structural stability and reusability of HTS-1. In addition, active intermediates for the ODS of bulky organic sulfides over HTS-1, i.e., Ti-peroxo (Ti-OOtBu) species, are captured by the UV-Vis technique.

The effect of variables like the pH, catalyst dose, dye concentration, hydrogen peroxide, purging gases, organic compounds, ionic strength, and comparison of different processes, radical scavengers, and reusability on AR14 removal efficiency were investigated.

Except for the dose, the efficiency of photocatalytic removal of AR14 decreased with the addition of other variables. AR14 photocatalytic removal obeyed the pseudo-second-order reaction kinetic. The EEO value for LED/SCBMGO (59.62 kWh/m3) process, as a function of removal proficiency, illustrated that this process was elevated productivity and diminished the cost of electrical energy consumed by the system.

However, due to the lack of fully extracting image information, the existing methods often generate unnatural and blurry outpainting results in most cases. To solve this issue, we propose a perceptual image outpainting method, which effectively takes the advantage of low-level feature fusion and multi-patch discriminator. Specifically, we first fuse the texture information in the low-level feature map of encoder, and simultaneously incorporate these aggregated features reusability with semantic (or structural) information of deep feature map such that we could utilize more sophisticated texture information to generate more authentic outpainting images. Then we also introduce a multi-patch discriminator to enhance the generated texture, which effectively judges the generated image from the different level features and concurrently impels our network to produce more natural and clearer outpainting results. Moreover, we further introduce perceptual loss and style loss to effectively improve the texture and style of outpainting images.

Prestressing CFRP plates is one of the efficient solutions used to utilize the high strength of CFRP plates to improve the performance of concrete structures. In order to prestress a CFRP plate, anchorages are required to grip the plate at its both ends. However, anchoring a CFRP plate is a challenging task due to its vulnerability to lateral loading. Hence, a novel compact wedge anchorage system for CFRP plate was developed and tested. The wedge anchorage is composed of an outer cylindrical steel barrel, two steel wedges, and two soft copper plates. The performance of the wedge anchorage was experimentally investigated under tensile loading. Two different presetting levels were applied: high presetting using a hydraulic press and low presetting by manual hammering. The reliability of the wedge anchorage was illustrated by successfully gripping the CFRP plate until its full tensile strength was attained. The reusability of the wedge anchorage was demonstrated by its consistent performance throughout the repeated tests. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CFRP plate; Concrete strengthening; Presetting; Prestressing; Wedge anchorage","Anchorages (foundations); Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Plates (structural components); Reinforced concrete; Reusability; Strengthening (metal); Tensile strength; A-carbon; Anchorings; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Concrete strengthening; Fibre reinforced polymer plates; High-strength; Performance; Presetting; Wedge anchorage; Prestressing",Conference Paper,Scopus

The people of Lavrio are very concerned about the degradation of the monument, because they always considered it as a valuable symbol of their recent history and demand it’s conservation. The documentation, conservation and reuse project of the wharf was a very difficult and challenging project that needed intensive interdisciplinary collaboration. The geometric documentation was executed using contemporary methods of data acquisition and processing and was part of an interdisciplinary approach concerning historical, architectural, structural and mechanical documentation. The architectural reuse proposal aims to conserve and revitalize the Wharf, reactivating it as a “living” cultural monument open to society. The stone walls and the metal structure will be conserved and other parts will be reconstructed.

In the case of emergency applications (as for temporary shelter after earthquakes, floods and all disastrous), the lightness, ease of transport, assembly, safety of use, possibility of disassembly and reuse are key aspects that composite FRP structures can provide easily. This paper presents a design-to-testing-to-production process of a full-scale pultruded glass fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) structure to investigate the structural performances according to the design at ultimate and serviceability limit states by cyclic and monotonic loads up to the failure. The capacity of the composite structure was assessed with respect to instantaneous and time-dependent loading effects. The experimental results are compared with the predictions of a numerical model based on the experimental mechanical characterization of the materials and the substructure such as frame elements and connections.

One way to reach a more sustainable world is to start re-using end-of-life structures and waste and give them a “Second Life” with new functions in the society. As fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are lightweight, strong, stiff and durable materials, there is great potential to re-use decommissioned FRP structures for new resource-efficient solutions in the building and infrastructure sectors. The present paper investigates innovative solutions in re-using wind turbine blades and glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) pipes as structural elements in new bicycle and pedestrian bridges. Specifically, a concept design for decking system made of GFRP pipes is developed and discussed. The main design requirements for pedestrian bridges are considered and assumptions regarding end-of-life GFRP quality and their mechanical properties have been addressed. The aim of this paper is to contribute to a sustainable use of GFRP waste and at the same time provide a more cost-effective solution for short span pedestrian bridges.

However, there is still a lack of biomass-based thermal insulating material, which should possess a characteristic of easily preparation but high thermal insulation performance. Herein, we developed an eco-friendly thermal insulation material by firstly pre-pressing sawdust powder into packed bed and then carbonizing the sawdust bed into porous carbon bed. The influences of the bed structure, environmental temperatures and humidity on the thermal conductivity of the prepared beds were firstly investigated. Results turn out that the carbonized pine sawdust packed (CPP) bed could have a low thermal conductivity of about 0.062 Wm-1K-1. A high intrinsic porosity of sawdust particle, high porosity of bed, and spherical shape of pores in the CPPs are preferred for reducing the thermal conductivity. Moreover, the prepared CPPs not only possess hydrophobicity but also show excellent reusability and structural stability. The thermal conductivity of CPPs can be fully recovered without obvious structure collapse, if dried again after placed under a relative humidity of 60% for more than 24 h. Importantly, the CPPs has excellent flame-retardant and smoke-free property because of the carbonization treatment in the preparation, and it can self-extinguish within 6 s in the vertical burning test.

In the current work, we have synthesized Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) functionalized graphene oxide-chitosan nanocomposite (GO-EDTA-CS) for simultaneous removal of inorganic (i.e., mercury (Hg(II) and copper (Cu(II)) and organic pollutants (i.e., methylene blue (MB) and crystal violet (CV)) from wastewater via adsorption process. The structural, functional, morphological, elemental compositions, surface area and thermal properties of the synthesized nanocomposite were identified using powder X−ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), field scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Brunauer−Emmett−Teller (BET), and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), respectively. Different batch adsorption experiments such as pH effect, contact time, initial pollutants concentration, reusability etc. were studied in monocomponent system to optimize the results. The adsorption process apparently followed pseudo−second−order (PSO) kinetics for both pollutants, however the adsorption kinetics was also explained by the intra−particle diffusion model. The isotherm data for both metals ions and dyes were well fit by the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum adsorption capacities of the adsorbent were determined 324 ± 3.30 130 ± 2.80, 141 ± 6.60, and 121 ± 3.50 mg g−1 for Hg(II), Cu(II), MB, and CV, respectively. The excellent adsorption capacity was attributed to the availability of various active functional groups (e.g., –COOH, –OH, –NH2, etc.) on the adsorbent. The EDS, elemental mapping and FTIR analysis performed before and after the adsorption of heavy metals and dyes by GO-EDTA-CS confirmed the simultaneous adsorption of the pollutants. Moreover, GO-EDTA-CS could maintain its adsorption capacity for both inorganic and organic pollutants even after seven cycles of adsorption-desorption, indicating itself a promising adsorbent for practical wastewater treatment containing both inorganic and organic toxic pollutants. © 2021","Kinetics; Monolayer adsorption; Multiple pollutants; Reproducibility; Wastewater","Adsorption; Aromatic compounds; Chitosan; Copper compounds; Dyes; Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Graphene; Health risks; Heavy metals; Isotherms; Mercury compounds; Monolayers; Nanocomposites; Organic pollutants; pH effects; Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Wastewater treatment; Adsorption capacities; Functionalized; Inorganics; Mercuries (Hg); Methylene Blue; Monolayer adsorption; Multiple pollutants; Reproducibilities; Simultaneous removal; Synthesised; Kinetics; adsorbent; chitosan nanoparticle; crystal violet; cupric ion; edetic acid; graphene oxide; inorganic compound; mercury; methylene blue; organic compound; chitosan; edetic acid; graphene oxide; graphite; nanocomposite; inorganic compound; nanocomposite; organic pollutant; oxide; pollutant removal; polymer; wastewater treatment; adsorption; adsorption kinetics; Article; chemical composition; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); contact time; controlled study; desorption; diffusion; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; field emission scanning electron microscopy; first order rate constant; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; isotherm; organic pollution; static electricity; surface area; synthesis; thermal analysis; thermogravimetry; waste component removal; waste water management; X ray powder diffraction; human; infrared spectroscopy; kinetics; pollutant; wastewater; water pollutant; Adsorption; Chitosan; Edetic Acid; Environmental Pollutants; Graphite; Humans; Kinetics; Nanocomposites; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,Scopus

Two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) layers have shown great promise as an efficient visible-light photocatalyst owing to its numerous active sites and large surface area. In this study, atomically thin MoS2 films of different thicknesses from monolayer to five-layer and ten layers were fabricated on sapphire substrates using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). We demonstrate that these MoS2 thin films can be used as a photocatalyst to degrade Methylene Blue (MB) dye and can be recovered completely with utmost structural and chemical stability. Under visible-light irradiation, the MB absorption peak completely disappears with ∼95.6% of degradation after 120 min. We also demonstrate the reusability of the MoS2 thin films without significantly losing the photocatalytic activity even after 5-cycles of degradation studies. The chemical and structural stability of the MoS2 films after 5-cycles of degradation studies were affirmed using various spectroscopic studies.

However, the contemporary idea consists on aluminum chips valorization to obtain finished parts with significant height change. Therefore, the approach of metal waste regeneration is based on direct use of machining chips into consolidated pellets by sintering. This paper assessed the influence of the grain size on the sintering of compacted EN AW 5083 aluminum alloy chips. In particular, it investigates the structural and mechanical properties of sintered samples that are not only depending on particle size distribution but also on implementation’ conditions such as the compacting pressure and the thermal treatment. Indeed, in order to highlight the compacting machine kinematics influence, the behavior of compacted pellets at two different pressures will be compared. Added to that, from pellets’ mechanical response, a characterization model is deduced to predict mechanical behavior for other subsequent uses more complex. This model is named Dracker–Prager Cap which is one of the families of plasticity models. It describes the aluminum shaving’s behavior in which the yield behavior depends on the equivalent pressure stress. Thus, this material modeling is applied in the numerical simulation based on the finite element calculation (FE) which allows a significant role in describing the compacting as well as sintering processes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Aluminum; Chips; Compacting; Mechanical properties; Modeling; Recycling; Simulation; Sintering","Aluminum alloys; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Pelletizing; Alloy chips; Chip; Compacting; Direct use; Machining chips; Modeling; Recycling; Reuse; Simulation; Valorisation; Sintering",Conference Paper,Scopus

The structural, morphological and functional group of as-prepared NiCo2O4 anchored MWCNTs was studied by using X-ray diffractometry, field emission scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The UV–vis diffusive reflectance spectroscopy results demonstrated decrease in optical bandgap from 1.32 to 1.16eV compared with pristine spinel NiCo2O4 nanoflakes. MWCNTs anchored NiCo2O4 showed extremely good photocatalytic behavior and we verified 98% degradation of MB in 35 min under natural sun light. NiCo2O4 anchored MWCNTs also confirmed its excellent stability and reusability by retaining 96% of photocatalytic efficiency after 7 cycles of operation. Improved photocatalytic behavior of NiCo2O4 anchored MWCNTs nanocomposite in comparison to NiCo2O4 nanoflakes is mainly attributed to excellent electron storage ability of MWCNTs which made catalyst a great acceptor. Moreover, porous structure of MWCNTs not only provides large surface area with more active sites but also increases conductivity and decreases agglomerations on the surface of material which render e-/h+ pair recombination.

All the xCu@Cu2O-CuNiAl(O)/rGO composites exhibit excellent catalytic activities for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), particularly 1.5Cu@Cu2O-CuNiAl(O)/rGO possesses the highest activity (kapp: 7.6 × 10-2 s−1, TOF: 265.0 h−1), and superb reusability with insignificant loss in activity for continuous 25 cycles, much better than those of recently reported Cu-based catalysts and even comparable to some noble metal catalysts. The best performance of 1.5Cu@Cu2O-CuNiAl(O)/rGO can be mainly attributed to the most uniformly dispersed electrophilic core@shell Cu@Cu2O NPs modified by NiO species structurally and electronically, the strongest Cu–Cu2O–CuNiAl(O)–rGO synergistic effect upon the unique nanosheet array-like morphology providing more ion-accessible active sites, and much improved adsorption for 4-NP via rGO layer due to π-π stacking. The universality and fixed bed tests further demonstrate potential practical applications of the present hierarchical non-noble composites for water remediation. The present facile synthesis strategy of the nanosheet array-like Cu@Cu2O-CuNiAl(O)/rGO composites with multi-phases synergy may be greatly beneficial to the design and construction of many other highly efficient multi-transition metal-based catalysts with excellent structural robustness for a broad range of applications in related catalysis processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","core@shell-type Cu@Cu2O nanoparticles; Cu−Cu2O−CuNiAl(O)−rGO synergy; In situ self-reduction by rGO; Nanosheet array-like composites; NiO; Nitrophenol reduction","Catalyst activity; Copper oxides; Morphology; Nanoparticles; Nanosheets; Nickel oxide; Phenols; Precious metals; Reusability; Substrates; % reductions; 4-Nitrophenol; Core@shell-type cu@cu2O nanoparticle; Cu−cu2O−cunial(O)−rGO synergy; In situ self-reduction by rGO; Nanosheet array-like composite; Nanosheet arrays; Nitrophenol reduction; Nitrophenols; Promotion effects; Shells (structures)",Article,Scopus

Extension of this method to modify lignocellulosic fibres became the current interest of various researches. To the best of our knowledge, modification of Ensete ventricosum plant (EV) fibre using acetic anhydride was hitherto unexplored. In this work, EV fibre was effectively acetylated with acetic anhydride using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) as a catalyst and the potential of modified EV fibre for oil sorption was further studied. Effects of temperature, time and liquid-to-material ratio (LMR) on weight percent gain (WPG) and oil absorptivity (OA) of the modified EV fibre were investigated. The changes in morphological, structural and thermal properties of modified EV fibre, in comparison to untreated fibre, were further analysed using FTIR, XRD, TGA and SEM. Solvent free acetylation at 120 °C for 3 h with LMR of 30:1 using 2% w/v NBS resulted WPG of 14.1% and OA of 19.7 g oil/g fibre.

Herein, we reported a simple strategy to synthesize hierarchical Co3O4-C@CoSiOx yolk-shell nanoreactors with multiple active components by using metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). The novel nanoreactors are further used to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for ciprofloxacin (CIP) degradation. The effects of reaction parameters (pH value, co-existing ions, reaction temperature, etc.) on CIP degradation were systematically investigated. Especially, ∼98.2% of CIP was degraded within 17 min under the optimal conditions, together with the low cobalt leaching and excellent reusability. The appreciable catalytic performance improvement might be due to the synergistic effect of the structure and component design: (1) the hierarchical yolk-shell structure endowed the catalyst with high surface area (∼232.47 m2/g) and fully exposed active sites; (2) abundant highly active ≡Co-OH+ were formed on the surface of CoSiOx; (3) the presence of oxygen vacancies and nitrogen-doped carbon promoted the decomposition of PMS through a non-radical process. The results revealed both the radical (SO4∙-, ∙OH and O2∙-) and non-radical (1O2 and direct charge transfer) should be responsible for the CIP degradation. Moreover, the possible degradation pathways of CIP were proposed through the identification of intermediates using LC-MS/MS techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.

The calcined NTs were characterised and evaluated in the physicochemical adsorption of the safranin dye and photocatalytic degradation of caffeine. The materials calcined at low temperatures displayed a tubular structure and the H2Ti3O7 crystalline phase, which was transformed into anatase nanoparticles at 400°C. The NTs treated at 100°C showed the highest adsorption capacity (94%). Safranin was adsorbed through an ion-exchange mechanism, following the Langmuir isotherm and a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. While NTs calcined at lower temperatures were better for adsorption, the photocatalytic degradation of caffeine increased in samples calcined at higher temperatures with a maximum removal of 72%. The photocatalytic behaviour of the NT samples confirmed that the crystalline anatase structure in conjunction with structural OH groups enhanced the photocatalytic activity. The addition of isopropanol as a scavenger confirmed the important role played by the •OH radicals in the photocatalytic process. NTs calcined at 300°C were efficient for both adsorption and photocatalytic processes. Due to its efficiency, this sample was reused after dye adsorption for the photocatalytic degradation of caffeine under visible light due to its enhanced absorbance in the visible region.

In this work, an in situ one-pot hydrothermal synthesis was explored to prepare a C-decorated and Cl-doped sea-urchin-like rutile TiO2 (Cl-TiO2/C). The growth of sea-urchin-like 3D hierarchical nanostructures was governed by a mechanism of nucleation and nuclei growth–dissolution–recrystallization growth from time-dependent morphology evolution. The crystal morphology and the content of Cl and C could be controlled by the volume ratio of HCl to TBOT. Systematic studies indicated that the 0.4Cl-TiO2/C sample (the volume ratio of HCl to TBOT was 0.4) exhibited the highest visible-light photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhodamine B, with kinetic rate constant (k) of 0.0221 min–1, being 6.5 and 3.75 times higher than that of TiO2 and Cl-TiO2. The enhanced photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the high charge separation and transfer efficiency induced by Cl-doping and C decoration and the excellent light-harvesting capacity caused by its sea-urchin-like nanostructure. Moreover, the 0.4Cl-TiO2/C sample exhibited good reusability and excellent structural stability for five cycles.

In this study, we address the energy, environmental, and economic benefits of the decontamination-and-reuse of the N95 masks. Two popular decontamination methods, including dry heat and vapor hydrogen peroxide (VHP), are investigated in this study for their effective pathogen inactivation and favorable performance in preserving filtration efficiency and structural integrity of respirators. Two multiple reuse cases, under which the N95 masks are disinfected and used five times with the dry heat method and 20 times using the VHP method, are considered and compared with a single-use case. Compared to the single-use case, the dry heat-based multiple-use case reduces carbon footprint by 50% and cumulative energy demand (CED) by 17%, while the VHP-based case decreases carbon footprint by 67% and CED by 58%. The dry-heat-based and VHP-based multiple reuse cases also present environmental benefits in most of the other impact categories, primarily due to substituting new N95 respirators with decontaminated ones. Decontaminating and reusing respirators costs 77% and 89% less than the case of single-use and disposal. The sensitivity analysis results show that the geographical variation in the power grid and the times of respirator use are the most influential factors for carbon footprint and CED, respectively.

The special ultrathin layer structures provided larger surface area, the accelerated separation and transfer of charges, and the abundant active sites to photo-degrade AMX. The optimal composite 6-CdS/NH4V4O10 presented a best degradation performance (94.4% removal rate with 5 wt% AMX) and high reusable stability. The investigation on the photodegradation mechanism revealed that the intercalation of CdS quantum dots into the laminar ultrathin NH4V4O10 nanobelts could not only expand interlayer space to increase the accessible active sites, but also well prevent CdS quantum dots agglomeration and shedding. In addition, in such architecture, the oxidation ability is maintained while the photo-excited hole and electrons is well separated.

The method applicability is demonstrated by a realistic case study. Results show that structures combining reused and new elements have a significantly lower environmental impact than solutions made of new material only. © The Author(s) 2021.","best-fit algorithm; circular economy; combinatorial equilibrium modeling; cutting-stock problem; graphic statics; Reuse; structural design","Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Life cycle; Best fit algorithm; Circular economy; Combinatorial equilibrium modeling; Cutting-stock problems; Design Exploration; Equilibrium modelling; Graphic statics; Reuse; Structural component; Truss design; Structural design",Article,Scopus

In the Mediterranean region, the seagrass Posidonia oceanica is responsible for huge agglomer-ates of ball-like seagrass litter. As these are often removed due to touristic reasons, a reuse method would be a step towards a more ecologically oriented society. In this study, the main polysaccharide components were analyzed, in order to propose possible usage options. To do this, different aqueous fractions were extracted, analyzed by classical carbohydrate analysis methods (GC-FID/MS, colorimetric assay and elemental analysis), and purified by ion-exchange chromatography, as well as selective precipitation with a detecting agent for highly glycosylated glycoproteins. The obtained purified fractions were analyzed in detail and a linkage-type analysis of the most promising extract was conducted via permethylation. Only low amounts of glycoproteins, as well as medium amounts of the characteristic apiogalacturonan were likely to be present, while xylan seemed to be the most abundant polysaccharide in most fractions. A partial structural proposal showed general accordance with land plant xylans, presenting reuse options in the field of biofuel and bioplastic generation. © 2021 by the author.

As has been discovered, milling by planetary ball mill is not effective. Grinding by collision is considered a more efficient way to refine brittle material and, in the case of cement, to regain its activity. There has been considerable research regarding the partial replacement of cement using disintegrated cement in mortar or concrete in the past few decades. This article determines and compares the creep and shrinkage properties of cement mortar specimens made from old disintegrated, old non-disintegrated, and new non-disintegrated Portland cement. The tests show that the creep strains for old disintegrated and old non-disintegrated cement mortars are close, within a 2% margin of each other. However, the creep strains for new non-disintegrated cement mortar are 30% lower. Shrinkage for old disintegrated and non-disintegrated cement mortar is 20% lower than for new non-disintegrated cement mortar. The research shows that disintegration is a viable procedure to make old cement suitable for structural application from a long-term property standpoint. Additionally, it increases cement mortar compressive strength by 49% if the cement is disintegrated together with sand. © 2021 by the authors.

However, as the demand for construction timber rises, the pressure on the world’s forest is increasing too. To maintain an adequate supply of timber from sustainable forests in the coming decades, the building industry must adopt practices that reduce the impact on forestry. Reuse is one of the principles of Circular Economy (CE). Among the technical challenges of reuse are the variability and the short size of the stock of elements coming either from demolition or from new construction, such as cut-offs and temporary scaffolding. This work presents a study for the design of structural configurations with short and non-regular sized elements that would normally be considered waste. The configurations are based on the principle of structural reciprocity and are generated by an optimization algorithm that allows minimizing the material waste and maximizing the stock elements use. A computational strategy based on the SPEA-II multi-objective method is employed for the investigation of optimal trade-offs between competing objective functions, such as structural lightness and optimal use of stock inventory. The goal of this work is demonstrating the feasibility of an industrial process, borrowing key elements from the Industry 4.0 paradigm, for a streamlined and economical production of standardized building components using non-standard reclaimed elements. © The Author(s) 2021.","construction; optimization; reciprocal structures; Reuse; sustainability; tectonics; timber structures; upcycling","Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Forestry; Industrial economics; Scaffolds; Structural optimization; Timber; Building industry; Combinatorial approach; Construction sectors; Construction timber; Optimisations; Reciprocal structures; Reuse; Sustainable forest; Timber structures; Upcycling; Sustainable development",Review,Scopus

The synthesized catalyst was applied to active peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for studying the degradation of methylene blue (MB). Various characterization results confirmed that Fe0 and Fe3O4 were distributed on the surface of composite catalyst, which had a porous structure and large specific surface area of 109.87 m2/g. Owning to these structural properties, the composite catalyst presented desirable catalytic capability and reusability. When 0.4 g/L PMS and 0.3 g/L composite catalyst were added into the MB solution (pH 7), 99.9% MB could be degraded within 60 min at a high reaction rate of 0.1550 min−1, which was much better than that of zero valent iron (ZVI)/PMS system. After the three cycles, the catalyst could still maintain an MB degradation of over 68.0%. The free radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments demonstrated that SO4−∙ and HO∙ were generated during the activation of PMS. The X-ray photoelectron spectrometer analysis revealed that Fe3O4 and various functional groups, such as C[dbnd]O were formed on the composite catalyst, and the Fe2+ was oxidized to Fe3+. Furthermore, the iron leaching experiments indicated that both the homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions occurred during the catalysis of PMS using the synthesized composite catalyst. Acidity and higher temperature were conducive to the catalytic reaction.

Four different catalyst samples with graphene content of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 were prepared and tested against dimethyl carbonate synthesis (DMC) synthesis using the transesterification method. Structural analysis by scanning electron microscopy revealed that La2O3 displayed nanorod morphology. DMC synthesis results showed that G/La-3 composite with 1% graphene content outperformed others and showed the highest DMC yield of ~84% at 180 ºC. The excellent performance of G/La-3 was attributed to the synergistic effect of 2-D rGO and 1-D La2O3 nanorods, which showed the highest surface area of 76.54 m2/g. Moreover, the existence of acidic and basic active sites as identified by the temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) technique facilitates DMC production over the surface of G/La-3 catalyst.

The objective of the present study was to assemble 2D Mnt and graphene oxide sheets into a three-dimensional aerogel (3D Mnt-rGO Gel) to achieve easy solid–liquid separation. Structural characterization demonstrated that the Mnt-rGO Gel has a porous 3D structure with Mnt nanolayers distributed uniformly within; the introduction of 2D Mnt could reduce significantly the degree of restacking of graphene sheets. Adsorption tests indicated that 2D Mnt enhances the methylene blue (MB) removal performance of Mnt-rGO Gel with a large adsorption capacity of 207 mg g–1, which may be attributed to the adsorption of MB onto 2D Mnt and the increased adsorption surface of rGO resulting from the reduced restacking of graphene sheets. The MB was removed completely by 300 mg L–1 of Mnt-rGO Gel-3 in 180 min. The adsorption process of MB onto Mnt-rGO Gel followed the pseudo-second order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model. Mnt-rGO Gel also showed good reusability. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results suggested that the adsorption of MB onto Mnt-rGO Gel may be attributed to the π–π interactions between aromatic rings of MB and graphene, hydrogen bonding, and the electrostatic interactions between the nitrogen groups on the MB and oxygen-containing groups on the Mnt-rGO Gel. © 2021, The Clay Minerals Society.","Composite aerogel; Methylene blue; Montmorillonite nanolayers; Reduced graphene oxide; Three-dimensional structure","Adsorption; Aerogels; Aromatic compounds; Dyes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Graphene; Hydrogen bonds; Isotherms; Reusability; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Active site; Composite aerogel; Graphene sheets; Methylene Blue; Montmorillonite nanolayer; Nano layers; Reduced graphene oxides; Restacking; Three-dimensional structure; Two-dimensional; Clay minerals; adsorption; dye; montmorillonite; oxide; oxygen; three-dimensional modeling; two-dimensional modeling; X-ray spectroscopy",Article,Scopus

Taking account of the serious water pollution, persulfate-based advanced oxidation technologies (PS-AOTs), as the essential strategy for wastewater treatments, have attracted more attention in recent years, which allow the transformation of chemical pollutants from different sources into less toxic and more readily biodegradable substances by oxidation and mineralization. The efficiency of the oxidation processes could be crucially improved by using appropriate MOFs. In this review, we summarize the strategies for rationally designing MOF-related materials as very efficient PS activators for the prominent elimination of organic contaminants through (i) tailoring compositions and structures of MOF-related catalysts to increase the number of active sites, enhance the electron transfer capacity and promote the surface properties; (ii) researching effects of environmental factors on catalytic performance and corresponding mechanisms to alleviate the negative influences; and (iii) balancing the contribution of different catalytic pathways (free radical and non-radical pathways) to realize better catalytic performance. Finally, we propose possible future directions for the design of MOF-related catalysts as PS activators based on the degradation mechanism, reusability, and toxicity. Additionally, due to the promising potential of MOFs for the elimination of arsenic compounds from water, the successive As(III) oxidation and by-produced As(V) adsorption in PS-AOTs by MOF-related materials were encouraged. These strategies could advance the future design of MOF-related catalysts as PS activators toward water decontamination. © 2021","Componential design; Degradation mechanism; Environmental parameter; Metal-organic framework (MOF); Persulfate activator; Structural design","Catalyst activity; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Crystalline materials; Decontamination; Free radical reactions; Free radicals; Iron compounds; Metal ions; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Metals; Organometallics; Oxidation; Porous materials; Reusability; Structural design; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Advanced oxidations technologies; Componential design; Degradation mechanism; Environmental parameter; Metal-organic framework; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Persulphate; Persulphate activator; Water decontamination; ]+ catalyst; Degradation",Article,Scopus

The grinding process used in the study proved to be efficient, because in addition to having a granulometry of 93.00% passing through the 290 μm sieve, the unit mass of the recycled plaster showed a value of 6.57 105 kg m−3. The recycled plaster obtained 9.3 MPa in the axial compression strength, 3.25 MPa in the splitting tensile strength, values greater than 20 MPa for the surface hardness and 0.27 MPa in the adhesion resistance, taking into account all mechanical requirements of Brazilian standards. It was possible to manufacture sheets of recycled lining paper only with waste lining paper coverings. Plasterboard sheets were produced that were fully recycled with recycled gypsum plaster and recycled lining paper. The recycled gypsum plasterboard showed 11.20 kg m−2 of surface mass density. 3.09 MPa and 2.62 MPa were obtained, respectively, in the longitudinal and transversal flexural strength tests. It reached 0.016 m in surface hardness determined by the maximum dent diameter. The axial compression strength of this recycled sheet was 14.37 MPa. The recycled gypsum plasterboard simultaneously met all the physical and mechanical requirements of Brazilian technical standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Construction and demolition waste; Drywall; Plasterboard; Wallboard","Compressive strength; Demolition; Environmental impact; Gypsum; Hardness; Linings; Plaster; Tensile strength; Walls (structural partitions); Circular economy; Compression strength; Construction and demolition waste; Drywall; Mechanical characteristics; Physical characteristics; Plasterboard; Recycled gypsums; Recycling process; Surface hardness; Recycling; Calcium Sulfate; Compression Strength; Hardness; Liners; Plaster; Tensile Strength",Article,Scopus

Structure characterization shows that the introduction of two-dimensional montmorillonite nanosheets (2D MMTs) into CMC-based hyddrogel results in a roguh surface and increased porosity. Adsorption tests demonstrate that the adsorption rate and adsorption capacity of CMC-based hydrogel increase significantly with the increase in 2D MMTs content, and a high adsorption capacity of 410 mg g−1 can be reached. After 5 cycles, CMC-MMTs Gel still exhibits good removal performance indicating a good reusability and structural stability. The enhanced MB removal performance and improved structural stability might be due to 2D MMTs and the increased porosity. FTIR and XPS characterizations demonstrate that the adsorption mechanism of MB onto CMC-MMTs Gel might be attributed to electrostatic adsorption and ion-exchange between MB molecules and MMTs, and the interactions between MB molecules and the hydroxyl and carboxyl groups of CMC. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carboxymethyl cellulose; Hydrogel; Methylene blue; Montmorillonite nanosheets","Cellulose; Clay minerals; Hydrogels; Ion exchange; Molecules; Nanosheets; Porosity; Reusability; Stability; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption mechanism; Carboxy-methyl cellulose; Electrostatic adsorption; High adsorption capacity; Structural stabilities; Structure characterization; XPS characterization; Adsorption; cellulose; dye; FTIR spectroscopy; gel; montmorillonite; nanomaterial; performance assessment; polymer; polymerization; X-ray spectroscopy; Cellulose; Clay; Ion Exchange; Molecules; Porosity; Stability",Article,Scopus

Because of the mechanical properties, the wheel-skid aircraft is more prone to produce course instability. To address this issue, the taxiing safe set of the wheel-skid aircraft is discussed based on the reachability theory. A dynamic model of the on-ground aircraft is established firstly, considering the complex condition of the ground loads. Then, the particular Hamilton–Jacobi partial differential equation is used to obtain the safe set. According to the safe set results, the optimal control of the rudder is built in the state space. Its effectiveness is verified by the comparison with other robust methods. In addition, three structural parameters are selected to analyze the influences on the safe set. Results indicate that the maximum safe yaw angle increases from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) at 70 m/s under the optimal control of the rudder when the steering of nose wheel is locked. The safe boundary in the middle–high-speed region expands by 43.5% under the rudder control. Because of the mechanical properties, uncontrollable deflection will appear due to the asymmetric disturbances when the longitudinal velocity is lower than 42 m/s. © IMechE 2021.","directional stability; Landing gear; optimal control; reachability; roll-out phase","Mechanical properties; Reusability; Rudders; Wheels; Complex condition; Directional stability; Jacobi partial differential equations; Longitudinal velocity; Optimal controls; Reachability theory; Robust methods; Structural parameter; Aircraft",Article,Scopus

As a respirator is front-line protection against particulate matter, including bioaerosol and droplets, a comprehensive understanding for the reuse strategy is needed. In this study, eight different disinfection methods commonly applied for the reuse of respirators were compared for their influence on the filtration and bactericidal/bacteria removal performance, with in-depth discussion on the cause of effects. Treatments including oven-dry, ultraviolet irradiation (UV), microwaving, laundering with and without detergent, and immersion in hypochlorite, isopropanol, and ethanol were performed to respirators. Immersion in ethanol or isopropanol was effective for inactivation and removal of bacteria, yet such a treatment significantly deteriorated the filtration efficiency in about 20–28%, dissipating the surface charges. Laundering, while effective in removing the attached bacteria, triggered physical damage, leading to a possible reduction of filtration performance. A short-term oven-dry, UV irradiation, and microwaving mostly preserved the filtration performance, yet the drawback lied in the incomplete bactericidal efficiency.

Replacing free nano-powders with active and stable films is thus a fundamental step towards developing effective photocatalytic devices. Aluminum represents a cheap and technologically-relevant substrate, but its photocatalytic applications have been hampered by adhesion issues and metal ion diffusion within the photocatalytic layer. In this work, the use of silica interlayers is investigated as a strategy to promote adhesion, efficiency and reusability of TiO2 films deposited on aluminum plates. Films were prepared from stable titania sols to avoid the use of nano-powders. Aluminum substrates with different surface morphology were investigated and the role of the silica interlayer thickness was studied. Films were extensively characterized, studying their structure, morphology, optical properties, adhesion and hardness. Self-cleaning properties were studied with respect to their superhydrophilicity and ability to resist fouling via alkylsilanes. Photocatalytic degradation tests were carried out using both volatile organic compounds and NO x , also in recycle tests.

Various analytical techniques were performed to investigate the structural, optical (band gap value is 2.5 eV), morphological as well as surface chemical composition of the as-prepared catalysts. A mean pore volume of 6.024 cm3/g, favourable surface area of 26 m2/g, and a pore diameter of 32.31 nm were all validated by surface area analyses. The creation of strong interfacial contact between MoS2 and WO3 caused the charges to be separated for a long time.

The photocatalyst's effectiveness was further tested by reusability experiments (5 runs) and the characterization results afterwards indicated the intactness of crystalline planes that is responsible for high efficacy. The percent chemical oxygen demand (% COD) removal of ∼66.6 and 57.14% was attained for Rh B and TM, respectively while percent total organic carbon (% TOC) removal for these pollutants was around 49.5 and 76.48%, respectively after 120 min.

This study demonstrates solutions to this challenge by analyzing a purposely designed case study: the Legacy Living Lab. The challenges of disguising and sealing, such as by waterproofing, two types of connections are analysed: structural and non-structural. This study details the materials and connections used across the two analyzed connection types and compares the weights and reusability of components.

Different from the emerging 2D materials that are generally inorganic in nature (graphene or 2D allotropes of various elements, MXenes, etc.), 2D CPs contain both inorganic and organic blocks, offering wider possibilities for structural diversification and area of applicability. However, in the crystallization process, 2D CP layers often stack on the basis of intermolecular interactions, leading to higher dimensional materials, which limit the manifestation of the size-effect properties. Their isolation individually or in multilayers with thickness/surface aspect ratio as small as possible is a challenge that seeks solutions through top-down or bottom-up approaches, each of them having certain limits. An original pathway consists in the use of a permethylated ligand with lower surface energy which, through its orientation in the coordination process to the metal ion, favors the anisotropic growth of the polymer and ensures the shielding of the formed nanosheet structure preventing the establishment of noticeable interlayer interactions.

The practice of reuse is being encouraged, aiming to minimize socio-environmental impacts. The present research aimed to develop polypropylene (PP) composites with CF waste, using styrene-(ethylene-butylene)-styrene grafted with maleic anhydride (SEBS-MA) and ethylene-propylene-diene grafted with maleic anhydride (EPDM-MA), as compatibilizers. The composites were processed in a mixer and injection molded. The addition of the CF in the PP matrix did not hinder processability, as verified in torque rheometry. Significant increases were achieved in impact strength and elongation at break, especially in the PP/FC/SEBS-MA and PP/FC/EPDM-MA composites. Incorporating 15% EPDM-MA reduced the elastic modulus and tensile strength by 23% and 32%, while SEBS-MA by 13% and 23%, relative to PP, respectively, due to the increase in flexibility of the composites. When the PP/FC composites were compatibilized with SEBS-MA and EPDM-MA, there was a higher level of interaction among the phases, generating a higher wettability, as verified in the scanning electron microscopy. Such behavior was important to increase the crystallinity of the compatibilized composites. The composites thermal stability increased significantly, increasing in 40°C, compared to pure PP. In general, the compatibilization with SEBS-MA was more effective, generating better properties. As a consequence, the heat deflection temperature of the composites remained the same as the level of pure PP, suggesting good structural stability. The results are valuable for the recycling area, since CF can be reused as a polymer additive to improve properties. © 2021 Society of Plastics Engineers.","carbon fiber; composites; polypropylene; reuse; waste","Bond (masonry); Butenes; Crystallinity; Environmental impact; Ethylene; Grafting (chemical); Graphite fibers; Impact strength; Injection molding; Maleic anhydride; Plastic recycling; Polypropylenes; Propylene; Scanning electron microscopy; Stability; Styrene; Tensile strength; Difficult material; Ethylene-propylene diene; Heat deflection temperature; Maleic anhydride copolymers; Polymer additive; Strength and elongations; Structural stabilities; Torque rheometry; Composite structures",Article,Scopus

Structural studies such as XRD and FTIR confirmed Nd and Cu doping at the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of barium hexaferrite, respectively. The SEM analysis made sure that the materials were successfully produced at the nanoscale. Dielectric measurements revealed that the dielectric constant and AC conductivity values of the co-doped sample were higher than those of the undoped sample. The VSM study confirms the improved magnetic properties of the sample after co-doping that facilitates its separation and reuse after photocatalytic experiments. The co-doped and undoped sample's photocatalytic activities (PCA) were explored by comparing their Methyl Green (MG) dye degradation efficiencies. The results revealed that the co-doped barium hexaferrite sample degraded almost 92.6% of the MG dye, while the undoped sample degraded just 37.4%. The higher PCA of the co-doped sample is credited to its structural defects, which adjust the band interval to increase electrical conductivity. In addition, the co-doped sample lost only 2% photocatalytic efficiency after five successive cycles, demonstrating its potential for reuse.

Indeed, green wall is an alternative form of constructed wetlands, which has been well recognized and widely applied worldwide for various wastewater treatments, particularly in greywater treatment. This review aims in shedding light on the current state of the new application of green walls, and highlighting the potential for further system and operational developments of this technology. Initially, the types of green wall systems, their various classifications, system designs, their benefits and performance in the treatment of wastewater for reuse purposes were reviewed. It shows that though the green wall has been largely limited for greywater treatment, the system has the potential to treat high strength organic wastewater. Furthermore, the integration of the green wall with disinfecting techniques has a high likelihood of producing treated effluent that meets water regulation standards for a wider range of reuse applications. Analysis of organic pollutant and nutrient removal efficiencies from experiments and case studies reviewed show that green wall design, choice of substrate and vegetation under the right operational conditions can significantly improve the overall performance of the green wall system. Finally, the future research directions are suggested for wide and wiser application of this kind of technology. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Constructed wetland; Green facade; Green walls; Living wall; Wastewater treatment","Efficiency; Effluents; Organic pollutants; Walls (structural partitions); Wetlands; Aesthetic value; Environmentally-friendly technology; Green buildings; Green facade; Green wall; Greywater treatment; Living wall; Performance; Reuse; Wall systems; Wastewater treatment; constructed wetland; effluent; organic pollutant; performance assessment; persistent organic pollutant; pollutant removal; wall",Review,Scopus

Additionally, the unsustainable treatment of resources belongs to the main concerns of the EU, resulting in the development of strategies for maximizing recycling rates in order to minimize environmental impacts and energy consumption caused by extraction of primary materials. In this paper, the Material Passport (MP) method, which evaluates the recycling potential and environmental impact of materials embedded in buildings, is demonstrated on a use case - a demolition object, in order to test its applicability at the end-of-life stage as well as to assess the recycling potential of the existing building. Three acquisition methods were applied on the use case in order to obtain information on the material composition as well as geometrical information: laser scanning, demolition acquisition (DA) and Urban Mining assessment (UMA), with regards to the quality and separability of the materials. A BIM-Model (Building Information Modelling) was generated, integrating the acquired data, as well as serving as knowledge database, from which element lists with incorporated materials were exported and mapped to the regarding recycling grade. As a result, an MP is generated for the exterior walls and the foundation, delivering information on the total masses, the share of recycling and waste masses, as well as the environmental impacts. The recycling potential of the exterior walls is ~52%, whereby the foundation has a recycling potential of ~20%. The existence of an MP at the end-of-life stage of a building can be seen as an outstanding advantage regarding recycling and reuse, thus supporting circularity and sustainability in the construction sector. © 2021 The Authors","Circular economy; End-of-life stage; Material passports; Recycling potential; Urban mining; Waste minimization","Architectural design; Construction industry; Data mining; Demolition; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Recycling; Sustainable development; Walls (structural partitions); Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Circular economy; End of lives; End-of-life stage; Exterior walls; Global consumption; Life stages; Material passport; Recycling potential; Urban mining; Waste minimization; Conservation",Article,Scopus

The mS shell acts as protection to slow down the oxidation and detachment of the AgNPs and incorporates channels to control the release of antimicrobial Ag+ ions. Results of TEM, STEM, HRSEM, EDS, BET, and FTIR showed the successful formation of the mS shells on MS-Ag aggregates 50-400 nm in size with highly uniform pores ∼4 nm in diameter that were separated by silica walls ∼2 nm thick. Additionally, the mS shell thickness was tuned to demonstrate controlled Ag+ release; an increase in shell thickness resulted in an increased path length required for Ag+ ions to travel out of the shell, reducing MS-Ag-mS' ability to inhibit E. coli growth as illustrated by the inhibition zone results. Through a shaking test, the MS-Ag-mS nanocomposite was shown to eradicate 99.99+% of a suspension of E. coli at 1 × 106 CFU/mL with a silver release of less than 0.1 ppb, well under the EPA recommendation of 0.1 ppm. This high biocidal efficiency with minimal silver leach is ascribed to the nanocomposite's mS shell surface characteristics, including having hydroxyl groups and possessing a high degree of structural periodicity at the nanoscale or ""smoothness""that encourages association with bacteria and retains high Ag+ concentration on its surface and in its close proximity. Furthermore, the nanocomposite demonstrated consistent antimicrobial performance and silver release levels over multiple repeated uses (after being recovered magnetically because of the oxidation-resistant silica-coated magnetic Fe3O4 core). It also proved effective at killing all microbes from Long Island Sound surface water.

In cases where a temporary excavation support is required, sheet pile walls can be more economical comparing to the other walls in the long run due to their reusability. In the present study the analyses were carried out by changing various parametric components such as the number of anchors in vertical row, horizontal and vertical spacing amongst the anchors, anchor angle and excavation depth in LARSSEN type sheet piles constructed temporarily in medium-dense sand. In the analyses, the trapezoidal horizontal earth pressure envelope recommended by FHWA (1999) since the stress concentration occured at the anchor locations. Besides the limit values recommended by FHWA (1999) and BS (1989) was used in the analyses. In total 35488 different sheet pile wall geometry configurations were investigated.

We use the spiropyran-merocyanine (SP-MC) interconversion to show that repeated activation of the SP mechanophore and deactivation of MC can be achieved by alternating mechanical stretching and hydrostatic compression, respectively. In the baromechanical cycle, MC acts as a ""barophore""that responds to hydrostatic pressure by bond formation. The activation and deactivation of SP/MC are understood in terms of strain and electronic effects. Beneficially, this two-step baromechanical cycle can be observed in real time by using UV/vis spectroscopy.

Herein, a versatile synthetic strategy is demonstrated to generate a series of transition metal SACs (M SAs/NC, M = Co, Cu, Mn; NC represents the nitrogen-doped carbon) through defect engineering of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The interatomic distance between metal sites can be increased by deliberately introducing structural defects within the MOF framework, which inhibits metal aggregation and consequently results in an approximately 70% increase in single metal atom yield. Additionally, the coordination structures of metal sites can also be facilely tuned. The optimized Co SAs/NC-800 exhibits superior activity and excellent reusability for the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes, surpassing several state-of-art non-noble-metal catalysts.

This study focuses on TeSA tiles that are topologically interlocking in two directions. Nonlinear finite element analysis is used to study the monotonic pushover behavior of TeSA walls with different edge tile configurations and a comparison is made thereof with a conventional reinforced concrete shear wall. The results indicate that the strength of TeSA walls is not significantly affected by the configuration of edge tiles. Damage progression in tiles and the number of damaged tiles that need to be replaced are also presented at different drift ratios. The study shows that reinforcement ratio substantially affects the wall lateral capacity.

Such a homojunction allowed for the complete interface optimization of t-CeVO4/m-CeVO4, to boost visible-light harvesting and enhance electron-hole transferring and separating, making a contribution to an effective visible-light-induced photocatalysis. P-doped CeVO4 homostructured nanobelts achieved outstanding photocatalytic activity, high long-term stability, and superior reusability in consecutive levofloxacin photocatalysis experiments.

Besides, construction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. According to the waste hierarchies, reuse is preferred to recycling; however, most of the recovery of construction and demolition wastes happens in the form of recycling and not reuse. Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts’ opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study. Furthermore, the results of the survey are used to develop an easy-to-understand learner for assessing the technical reusability of the structural elements at the end-of-life of a building.

Therefore, the research and the development of novel energy-saving manufacturing processes and sustainable construction materials is more than ever urgent and challenging. This paper aims at identifying the industrial process for the production of novel geopolymers to be used as a greener substitute for cement, especially the Portland one, widely used for structural applications to significantly reduce the environmental impact of the construction industry. Here, the materials sustainability and the manufacturing process are improved by valorising and reusing wastes, deriving from the pulp-paper industry, as raw materials. This industry generates a great quantity of wastes that represent a real concern both for their environmental impact and cost of disposal. The new industrial process was evaluated after scaling up the laboratory procedure to an industrial dimension. Consequently, each small-scale process was deeply analysed (raw materials involved and processes) and transposed into a massive-production. The most relevant processes that show an elevated environmental impact were identified and the energy consumption of the whole process has been assessed resulting, for the analysed geopolymeric product, an embodied energy of 645 MJ/ton, being about one sixth of the OPC. Moreover, a preliminary economic analysis has been conducted in terms of raw materials involved in the proposed industrial process revealing a decreasing cost per ton increasing the waste recycling. All considered, the main conclusions are that the industrial scale up of the proposed geopolymeric product, assessed for the first time in literature along with the related proposed considerations, could be highly competitive to the Portland production involving greener processes with a much lower energy consumption and a greater financial saving by improving the wastes quantity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Construction; Economic analysis; Geopolymeric mortars; Industrial scale-up; Sustainability","Cement industry; Construction; Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Geopolymers; Industrial economics; Industrial research; Inorganic polymers; Mortar; Paper and pulp industry; Waste disposal; Circular economy; Economics analysis; Energy intensive industries; Energy-savings; Environmental pollutions; Geopolymeric mortar; Industrial processs; Industrial scale up; Manufacturing process; Scaling-up; Sustainable development; Construction; Costs; Economic Analysis; Energy Conservation; Mortar; Waste Disposal",Article,Scopus

Here, we report the Fe3+-enhanced decomposition of PMS by a two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide WS2 for pollutant degradation and E. coli disinfection. Experimental results showed that the removal rates of six representative pollutants were all above 90% under various pH conditions. Over a wide range of pH values (2–9), the removal rate of carbamazepine (CBZ) in PMS/WS2/Fe3+ system almost reached 100% within 10 min, and E. coli could be inactivated by 97.3% within 1 min. WS2 in the system accelerated the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle and participated in the activation of PMS. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and scavenging experiments demonstrated that the SO4[rad]− and HO[rad] radicals were the main active oxidative species. The degradation pathway of CBZ was revealed based on its intermediates as determined by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS). The presence of common anions such as Cl− and HCO3− in PMS/WS2/Fe3+ system noticeably affected the CBZ degradation. The characterization results verified the structural stability and the reusability of WS2. These research findings suggest that the combination of Fe3+ and WS2 is a promising method for PMS activation to remove organic pollutants and inactivate pathogenic bacteria during the process of wastewater treatment. © 2021","AOPs; Bacterial inactivation; Degradation pathway; Peroxymonosulfate; Tungsten disulfide","Amides; Chemical activation; Disinfection; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Escherichia coli; Iron compounds; Organic pollutants; Paramagnetic resonance; Reusability; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Wastewater treatment; AOP; Bacterial inactivation; Carbamazepine; Degradation pathways; Fe$+3+$; Peroxymonosulfate; Peroxymonosulfate activations; Removal rate; Tungsten disulfide; WS$-2$; Sulfur compounds; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzoic acid; bicarbonate; carbamazepine; chloramphenicol; chloride; ciprofloxacin; hydroxyl radical; iron; peroxymonosulfate; sulfadiazine; sulfate; tungsten disulfide nanosheet; unclassified drug; coliform bacterium; decomposition analysis; degradation; drug; iron; organic pollutant; pollutant removal; tungsten; Article; bacterial virulence; disinfection; drug degradation; electron spin resonance; Escherichia coli; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; nonhuman; oxidation; pH; priority journal; time; waste component removal; waste water management; water pollutant; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli",Article,Scopus

Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D) hollow heterojunction was prepared by coating the indium zinc sulfide (ZnIn2S4) nanosheets with rich-zinc vacancies (VZn) on 3D hollow titanium carbide (Ti3C2). The obtained 3D hollow heterojunction (Ti3C2@ZnIn2S4) achieved effective optical collection and promoted the separation and transmission of photogenerated carriers as well as the surface reaction of spatial separation. In addition, time-resolved photoluminescence and steady-state photoluminescence spectra indicated that the existence of VZn and the introduction of hollow Ti3C2 spherical shell effectively inhibited the recombination of photogenerated carriers and accelerated their separation and transmission, thus further enhancing the photocatalytic activity. In addition, the introduction of 3D hollow Ti3C2 benefited a larger specific surface area for heavy metal adsorption. Due to the unique structural and compositional characteristics, the heterojunction showed high efficiency of Cr(VI) reduction under visible light. In particular, the optimal Ti3C2@ZnIn2S4 heterojunction (1%-Ti3C2@ZnIn2S4) achieved 100% removal of Cr(VI) within 25 min, with a reaction rate constant of 0.225, which was 8.5 times higher than that of the pristine ZnIn2S4.

Thus, to address serious worldwide water pollution caused by arsenate and phosphate, the Mg–Al layered double hydroxides-functionalized hydrochar (Mg–Al LDHs-FHC) composite was synthesized via an in situ one-pot hydrothermal method. The Mg:Al molar ratios (2:1–4:1) and hydrothermal temperatures (150–210 °C) played significant roles in influencing the structural properties of the Mg–Al LDHs-FHC composites. Specifically, the Mg–Al LDHs-FHC composite prepared at Mg:Al molar ratio of 2:1 and hydrothermal temperature of 150 °C showed the best arsenate (100%) and phosphate (99.7%) removal due to the highest charge density (4.132 e/nm2) and the largest interlayer d-spacing (0.8371 nm), facilitating strong electrostatic adsorbent–adsorbate interaction and easy intercalation into the interlayer. Single-component isotherm data fit Langmuir and Freundlich models, while binary-component data used extended and ideal adsorbed solution theory combining these models. Overall, the adsorption affinity of the composite followed the order arsenate &gt; phosphate (single-component system) and arsenate &lt; phosphate (binary-component system). Spectroscopic analyses demonstrated that the different physicochemical characteristics of arsenate and phosphate, such as partial charge density, ionic radius, and the coordinate bonding characteristics were responsible for the competitive adsorption behavior. Stable reusability at least five times indicates that the Mg–Al LDHs-FHC composite could be a promising adsorbent for simultaneous arsenate and phosphate removal from water. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Arsenic and phosphorus oxyanions; Competitive adsorption; Hydrochar composite; Mg–Al layered double hydroxides","Aluminum compounds; Dyes; Hydrothermal synthesis; Molar ratio; Reusability; Spectroscopic analysis; Water pollution; Adsorption affinity; Arsenate removal; Arsenic and phosphorus oxyanion; Competitive adsorption; Functionalized; Hydrochar composite; Hydrothermal methods; Mg-Al layered double hydroxide; One pot; Phosphate removal; Adsorption",Article,Scopus

This alternative reduces the demand for natural resources by the construction sector and provides a proper destination for a range of industrial residues. However, the alternative materials must perform properly for safe applications. In this way, the steel slag, a residue of the steel industry, stands out. The steel slag is already applied in some cement-based composites showing enhancement in the mechanical performance, although its durability is barely evaluated. So, this research produced eco-friendly structural concretes of three compressive strength classes and for similar application parameters. The evaluations were performed in concretes with total replacement of conventional aggregates by steel slag aggregates, containing no chemical admixtures and in the presence of a PCE-based superplasticizer. The mechanical performance and resistance to carbonation of these products were evaluated. An accelerated carbonation test was proposed and adopted to better understand the carbonation phenomenon within the research timeframe. The steel slag concretes presented higher compressive strengths and reductions in carbonation depths up to 60% compared to conventional ones.

Given that the vision of permanent lunar and Martian human presence is materialising, it is an opportune moment to reflect on the future applicability and challenges of off-Earth design. This article investigates contemporary thinking about off-Earth structural design – specifically focused on large-scale infrastructure such as habitats – and assesses it in terms of its sustainability. We suggest that the extra-terrestrial setting, which is characterised by resource, construction, and labour constraints, is to be analysed as an extreme case of the built environment on Earth. Subsequently, we propose that structural design methodologies originating on Earth can benefit both the off-Earth context, through their inherent material efficiency and use of local materials, and the on-Earth context, where unsustainable growth and material inefficiency dominate our built environment. As our planet rapidly heads towards a scarcity of construction materials and disruptive environmental change, what sustainability lessons can we learn from our past, and how can we apply these to extra-terrestrial construction? Finally, how can we use these lessons to futureproof our built environment?. © 2021, TU Delft.

One of the sustainable options is to utilise scrap tyre as tyre shreds/tyre chips (generally called as Tyre Derived Aggregate, TDA) and sand mixture as a lightweight fill material in the construction of infrastructure. Utilising TDA in infrastructure projects has multiple benefits including environmentally sustainable recycling and reuse of the scrap tyre thereby easing the consumption of natural fills, reduced material costs and enhanced geotechnical properties of the soil. Understanding the shear and volume change behaviours of TDA and sand mixture is critical before recommending the mixture as a suitable lightweight-reinforcing structural fill. In this study, the effect of the addition of TDA on the shear behaviour of sand was investigated using large scale direct shear and triaxial apparatus. It has been observed that TDA has significant influence on the shear and volume change behaviours of sand. Also, overall improvements in the soil characteristics, such as enhanced shear strength, can be achieved by the addition of TDA in sand. © 2021 Southeast Asian Geotechnical Society.

However, when a modeling ecosystem is available, measuring the constituting artifacts singularly might not be enough. This paper proposes a quality assessment approach, which considers the relationships among the artifacts under analysis as part of the quality measurement process. For instance, to assess the quality of model transformations, further than measuring their structural characteristics, users might be interested in quality aspects like coverage and information loss related to the depending metamodels and the way models are consumed by transformations, respectively. The proposed approach is based on weaving models, which permit to link quality definitions of different kinds of artifacts, and it can generate Epsilon Object Language (EOL) programs by means of a model-to-code transformation to perform the specified quality assessment process. © 2021 IEEE.","MDE; Modeling ecosystems; Quality Evaluation Systems; Quality model","Ecosystems; Quality control; Empirical studies; Engineering community; Interrelated models; Meta model; Model ecosystems; Model-driven Engineering; Quality assessment; Quality evaluation system; Quality modeling; Reuse; Cosine transforms",Conference Paper,Scopus

The proposed damper employs a special detailing which enables fast assembly and reliable mechanical performance, and has high flexibilities in load resistance, deformability and energy dissipation capacity, catering to various design objectives. The working principle of the damper is first introduced, followed by a comprehensive experimental study on six full-scale damper specimens subjected to different loading protocols. The specimens exhibit very stable flag-shaped hysteretic behavior and are fully reusable with almost no damage after experiencing the considered test sequence. Reliable energy dissipation is provided by the dampers with little sensitivity to the repeated cyclic loading, where a typical equivalent viscous damping of 20% is achieved at large deformations. The work is then extended to a system level analysis, considering varying brace parameters, to evaluate the effectiveness of the self-centering bracing system in seismic control. A buckling-restrained braced frame is also included in the analysis for comparison. Among other findings, the study indicates that the fullness of the flag-shaped hysteresis is a critical factor affecting the key structural performances. In particular, decreasing the energy dissipation factor is effective in eliminating the residual deformation, but at the cost of amplified peak deformation and floor acceleration responses. A “partial self-centering” system, which allows certain static residual deformation of the brace, is found to simultaneously suppress the peak deformation, residual deformation, and peak floor acceleration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Disc spring; Friction; Seismic resilience; Self-centering; Steel braced frame","Damping; Energy dissipation; Floors; Friction; Hysteresis; Seismology; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Bracing systems; Disk springs; Floor accelerations; Hazard mitigations; Performance assessment; Residual deformation; Seismic hazards; Seismic resilience; Self centering; Steel braced frames; Deformation; buckling; deformation; energy dissipation; friction; loading; peak acceleration; performance assessment; seismic hazard; structural component",Article,Scopus

The new hc-BZM was synthesized via the cost-effective sonochemical method. A simple and convenient electrochemical determination of OFL was developed based on hc-BZM modified GCE. The physicochemical and electrochemical characterization was investigated by CV and DPV. The respective calibration curve has good linearity with current vs the concentration of OFL in the range of 0.5 to 39 μM with a correlation coefficient of R2 = 0.991. From the calibration curve slope, the detection limit and sensitivity were determined to be 0.03 μM and 1.063 μA μM-1 cm-2. The proposed sensor explained the structural advantages of simple design, low cost, wide linear range, good selectivity, and reusability.

This work assesses the viability of an alternative to the use of CEM III B 32.5 R cement in mortars for the internal coating of centrifugally spun cast iron pipes for water piping. The proposal is to reuse the slag generated in the casting process after being finely ground, as an addition mixed with CEM I 52.5 R cement, which is basically Portland clinker. In order to analyse this possibility, an extensive experimental campaign was carried out, including the analysis of the cupola slag (micro-structural and chemical composition, leachates, setting time, vitrification, puzzolanicity and resistance to sulphate) and regarding the mortars (workability and mechanical properties). The experimental programme has shown that the optimum substitution is achieved with a replacement percentage of 20% of the cement, with which similar workability, superior mechanical properties and guaranteed resistance to sulphate attack are obtained. In addition, both economic and environmental savings are achieved by not having to transport or landfill the waste.

Theoretical calculations were performed to optimize the geometries of the kaolinite, DMSO, KDMSO, molecular and protonated etheramine structures, as well as the interaction between etheramine and kaolinite. XRD and FTIR results confirm the intercalation of DMSO into kaolinite, the intercalation process caused a significant increase in the isoelectric point.

The kinetic data most accurately fit the pseudo-second-order model. The fitting of the experimental data to the isotherm models indicated that the Sips is the most appropriate model. The calculation of Eads revealed that mechanism of etheramine removal by KN and KDMSO involve chemisorption. The reusability tests determined that after four uses, the etheramine removal efficiency does not change significantly, enabling the use of kaolinite for wastewater treatment. Theoretical studies have enabled a better understanding of the intercalation process. In addition to increasing the interlayer spacing (2.50-8.01 Å), the introduction of the DMSO molecule modifies the charge distribution in the kaolinite structure, which contributes to the increase in the amount of etheramine adsorbed.

One way to approach the carbon neutrality is through reuse of structural components. In order to enable economic reuse of precast concrete elements, their connections must be designed to allow an effortless dismount. While dismount ability provides additional value to the structure, it cannot have a negative impact on other crucial properties of the connection. One of those properties is the load-transfer capacity. While the impact of improved demountability on the load-transfer of axial forces is negligible, the capacity of such joints to transfer shear forces can be questioned, as it is often assumed to rely on the friction generated along compressed section.

Therefore, the objective of this project was to develop an LSPR biosensing method for rapid, sensitive and specific detection of enrofloxacin (ENRO), using polydopamine molecular imprinted polymer (PDA-MIP) as the recognition element. The PDA-MIP film was fabricated by polymerization of dopamine and ENRO in Tris buffer on the surface of LSPR sensor chip.

To amplify LSPR detection signals of ENRO, conjugates with protein molecules were synthesized, served as competitors, and reacted with the residual binding sites on the PDA-MIP film. The detection could be done within 20 min, with a detection range of 25–1000 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 61.1 ng/mL. The PDA-MIP film demonstrated a higher binding capacity to ENRO than the corresponding non-imprinted polymer film, and discriminated ENRO among structural analogues. Good reusability was achieved within seven binding-regeneration cycles, with a low relative standard deviation. With high sensitivity, specificity and stability, the developed LSPR/PDA-MIP sensor showed its potential for in-field rapid detection of ENRO residues. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Competitive assay; Enrofloxacin; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Molecular imprinted polymer; Polydopamine","Amines; Antibiotics; Binding sites; Biosynthesis; Food products; Mammals; Plasmons; Polymer films; Reusability; Semiconducting films; Sodium compounds; Sulfur compounds; Bovine serum albumins; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Maximum residue limits; Molecular imprinted polymers; Non-imprinted polymers; Regeneration cycles; Relative standard deviations; Sodium dodecyl sulphate; Surface plasmon resonance",Article,Scopus

Herein, a film-like chitin/polyethylenimine biosorbent (CH-PEI) was prepared and employed in the removal of uranyl-carbonate compounds from water. Fourier transform infrared spectra, element analysis, scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, N2adsorption-desorption isotherms and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to characterize the biosorbent. Besides, thermodynamic calculation and various batch experiments were conducted to investigate the adsorption performances of CH-PEI for uranyl removal from carbonate solution. The results showed that the biosorbent possessed a unique hierarchically porous structure and a high nitrogen content. The batch experiments exhibited that it obtained the maximum adsorption capacity at pH = 6. Notably, CH-PEI could reach sorption equilibrium within 4 h at the initial concentration of 50 mg/L. The maximum adsorption capacity were 247.04 mg/g and 1023.74 mg/g at the initial concentrations of 50 mg/L and 300 mg/L. The kinetics and isotherm data were well fitted by pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models. It could remove 98.9% of uranium in the simulated groundwater. The biosorbent showed fast regeneration, good structural stability and reusability in 5 cycles. Furthermore, the adsorption mechanism was confirmed to be anion exchange and electrostatic attraction between nitrogen species and uranyl-carbonate complexes through FT-IR and XPS analysis. Considering its low costs, high efficiency and easy collection, CH-PEI would be a promising biosorbent for uranium removal from groundwater.

A harmful effluent like organic dyes, heavy metals, acids from industries mixed in wastewater is deteriorating the environment. To get rid of these poisonous materials and to recycle wastewater for domestic purposes, there are many steps which included photocatalytic dye degradation. PVP assisted Mn–CdS nanoparticles was prepared by novel hydrothermal technique. The characteristic behavior of pure and PVP (1% and 2%) assisted Mn–CdS samples were studied by further analysis. The structural, optical, vibrational, morphological, chemical composition behavior of synthesized pristine and surfactant induced Mn–CdS nanoparticles were analyzed. UV–Vis spectra revealed the optical behavior of the prepared pure and PVP (1% and 2%) assisted Mn–CdS samples. The bandgap obtained was 2.2, 2.06 and 1.99 eV for pure Mn–CdS, 1% PVP-Mn-CdS and 2% PVP- Mn-CdS. The narrow bandgap is one of the advantage of the material. Mn–CdS, 1% PVP-(Mn–CdS) and 2% PVP- (Mn–CdS) morphology were further investigated by Scanning Electron Microscopic studies (SEM). The surfactant (PVP) was added to enhance the morphology development and decrease agglomeration on the surface and the SEM images revealed a clear evidence for enhancement of morphology in all three samples. 2% PVP-(Mn–CdS) sample showed a good development in morphology when compared with other two samples and the best sample showed formation of nanorods below the surface of nanoparticles. Further, Mn–CdS, 1% PVP-(Mn–CdS) and 2% PVP- (Mn–CdS) was indulged to investigate the cationic degradation. The photocatalytic activities of three samples were carried out with loading different amount of the catalysts and 30 mg catalyst 2% PVP- (Mn–CdS) loaded dye solution showed a considerable degradation of methylene blue dye. The 30 mg catalyst (2% PVP-Mn-CdS) showed 98% efficiency under visible light irradiation for about 2 h. The best candidate, 30 mg catalyst (2% PVP-Mn-CdS) investigated for its reusability. The catalyst showed almost 98% of efficiency up to three cycles which confirmed the level of potential of the sample. 2% PVP-(Mn–CdS) sample would be promising candidate in wastewater treatment.

The surface modified CuS nanoparticles with dopamine (DOP) were prepared by using fast and cost effective microwave assisted methodology. Here, DOP act as biological ligand for the reduction and capping of CuS nanoparticles. The structural and morphological analyses revealed the size controlled synthesis of CuS in presence of DOP with higher thermal stability. The bio-compatibility and non-toxic behaviour of CuS@DOP nanoparticles was evaluated against L929 cell lines and on E. coli and S. aureus strains. The visible light driven photocatalytic activity of the synthesized CuS@DOP was scrutinized for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) dyes, as a model of water contaminants. The photocatalytic degradation of MB by CuS@DOP attained 97% after 10 min of visible light irradiation. The effect of catalyst dose, pH, initial concentration of MB dye, electrolytes, contact time, synergic effect of photolysis and catalysis were studied in detail for optimizing the degradation efficiency of CuS@DOP. The mechanism of CuS@DOP photocatalysis and the formed degraded products were analyzed by using LC/MS technique. The reusability and stability of photocatalyst was confirmed by reusing the catalyst for six successive runs with catalytic performance as high as 80%.

The Fe-TiO2/PVDF-0.10 composite membrane achieved a higher BPA degradation efficiency (69.9%) within reaction time of 180 min than pristine PVDF membrane 45.1%. The quenching tests and ESR results confirmed the dominant role of hole (h+) and [rad]O2− as active species responsible for BPA degradation in the photocatalytic system.

Here, we proposed a series of K-Cu supported paper catalysts (xK-yCu/mTZP) with excellent catalytic activity and stability by using TiO2-ZrO2 mesoporous fibers as matrix. The abundant synergic effects were found in the quaternary K-Cu-Ti-Zr component system, as evidenced by XPS, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, etc. The experimental and DFT calculation results showed that addition of copper species as K-stabilizer can inhibit the mobility of potassium, and provide an opportunity for the phase separation following the reaction of 8ZrTiO4 + K2O → K2Ti8O17 + 8ZrO2(t).

Recycling these materials, however, remains a chal-lenge. Homogeneous material composition and the use of thermoset matrices complicate repro-cessing, and result in low-grade recyclate. This means that closing the loop for these materials in a circular economy remains challenging, especially for glass fibre-reinforced thermoset composites. For a circular economy, products need to be designed to preserve product functionality, material properties, and economic value for as long as possible. However, recovery strategies, design aspects and their interconnectedness are currently largely unexplored for products containing fibre-rein-forced polymers. The aim of this study was to identify circular strategies and determine design aspects for products containing composites. To achieve this, we conducted a systematic literature review and consulted experts. The circular strategies are largely similar to generic circular economy strategies as far as product integrity is concerned. However, on a material level, we identified addi-tional approaches, the most notable of which is structural reuse, which preserves the material quality and thereby value. The design aspects were clustered and positioned along the product design process to support implementation.

Mechanical properties including flexural and compression strength of the binders, unconfined compressive strength and resilient modulus of the mixtures were determined by standard laboratory testing methods, to provide baselines for the viability evaluations. To ensure proper durability of the mixtures as pavement construction materials, the long-term performance was investigated in terms of frost heave and resistance to freezing-thawing cycles. In general, stabilized WFS and crushed rock mixtures showed great potentials in strength and durability for pavement structural layers. Cost and emission assessment also showed that the use of foundry sand in a filter layer is beneficial in reducing cost and CO2 emission by up to 50% and 46% compared with reference structures.

Moreover, a case study of life cycle environmental impact assessment was conducted to quantify the potential of reusing timber to abate global warming and other environmental burden. The literature review highlighted the possibility of reusing structural timber, but pointed to the need for efficient and standardized assessment criteria. The interviews indicated interest towards the concept of circular economy applied to construction and demolition wood material, although this appears to be driven more by policy and regulation rather than for business reasons. Therefore, a reconfigured conceptual framework to achieve circularity for wood is proposed, where material brokers would be used to connect different actors along the value chain. The paper concludes with a case study showing that reusing structural timber components can result in a significant reduction of the environmental burden. © 2021","Carbon footprint; Cascading; Circular economy; Environmental impact; Reuse; Timber","Carbon footprint; Economics; Environmental impact assessments; Global warming; Life cycle; Timber; Cascading; Case-studies; Circular economy; Economic challenges; Environmental burdens; Environmental challenges; Finland; Literature reviews; Reuse; Structural timbers; Environmental impact; carbon footprint; climate change; conceptual framework; construction material; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; literature review; recycling; timber; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; conceptual framework; disease burden; environmental impact; environmental policy; Finland; greenhouse effect; life cycle; life cycle assessment; standardization; Finland",Article,Scopus

This paper examines Dutch adaptive reuse practices regarding their functional, operational and financial models, and assesses their circularity performance by evaluating cultural values preservation, circularity of reuse intervention, and outcomes from use. Primary data was collected through an online survey of stakeholders representing 53 cases. We employed Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to summarize the relationships among variables and Partial Least Square-Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) analysis to assess the weights of the active variables and their causal relationships. We then conducted a factorial mapping and hierarchical cluster analysis to investigate further the correlations between certain characteristics, individual cases, and active circularity variables. The findings indicate that there has been a major trend towards more private sector involvement, stimulation for pro-active engagement of local actors, and better dialogue among stakeholders. In addition, stakeholders acknowledge that adaptive reuse strongly contributes to conserving cultural values. However, stakeholders only weakly recognize its correlation to the circularity framework in the limited context of the physical built environment. This study provides essential insights regarding emerging adaptive reuse trends and circularity performance, which can be further incorporated into circular economy strategies and roadmaps for the built environment. The framework established in this paper for analyzing circularity performance of adaptive reuse practices is transferable, and can be replicated in empirical studies worldwide. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptive reuse; Built heritage; Circular economy; Circularity performance; Netherlands; Subjective performance analysis","Hierarchical systems; Adaptive reuse; Built environment; Built heritage; Circular economy; Circularity performance; Cultural value; Netherlands; Performance; Reuse practices; Subjective performance analyse; Cluster analysis; adaptive management; cultural heritage; empirical analysis; heritage conservation; performance assessment; stakeholder; Netherlands",Article,Scopus

The addition of graphite graphene oxide induced relatively small-sized Bi4O5Br2 nanosheets, thus causing expansion of band structures with stronger redox capabilities. In addition, the involvement of graphene oxide in composites also leaded to enlarged specific surfaces areas with abundant active sites, enhanced visible light harvesting, and strengthened charge carriers by heterojunction domains at interface, ensuring the improved photocatalytic NO removal efficiencies in comparison to bare Bi4O5Br2 under visible light.

In this work, a novel visible-light-responsive ZnO/NiCr2O4 nanocomposite was successfully synthesized via a hydrothermal procedure. The characterization of products was conducted by different techniques to study optical, structural, and morphological properties. The ZnO/NiCr2O4 nanocomposite performance for photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline (98 %) and phenol (81.4 %) considerably exhibits 4.2 and 1.9 enhancement over ZnO and NiCr2O4, respectively. The ZnO/NiCr2O4 nanocomposite's excellent photocatalytic activity was ascribed to the enhanced visible light absorption and construction of p-n heterojunction, resulting in an effective photogeneration, separation, and transfer of electron-hole pairs into the active sites on photocatalysts. Trapping experiments disclosed that the predominant active species in photocatalytic reactions were ⦁OH and hole. The data obtained from the results of EIS, M–S test, PL, and trapping experiments were examined in detail, and based on that, a possible mechanism was proposed.

The synthesized nanocomposite was well characterized using FTIR, XRD, BET, FESEM, and TEM techniques. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms of the magnetic nanocomposites for QCT were investigated in detail at different initial concentrations and temperatures.

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables.

A unique way to immobilize enzymes is co-crystallization/co-precipitation, which removes the limitation on enzyme/substrate size. Thus far, most enzyme@MOF composites rely on the use of non-sustainable chemicals and, in certain cases, heavy metals, which not only creates concerns regarding environmental conservation but also limits their applications in nutrition and biomedicine. Here, we show that a dimeric compound derived from lignin, 5,5′-dehydrodivanillate (DDVA), co-precipitates with enzymes and low-toxicity metals, Ca2+and Zn2+, and forms stable enzyme@Ca/Zn-MOM composites. We demonstrated this strategy on four enzymes with different isoelectric points (IEPs), molecular weights, and substrate sizes. Furthermore, we found that all enzymes displayed slightly different but reasonable catalytic efficiencies upon immobilization in the Ca-DDVA and Zn-DDVA MOMs, as well as reasonable reusability in both composites. We then probed the structural basis of such differences using a representative enzyme and found enhanced restriction of enzymes in Zn-DDVA than in Ca-DDVA, which might have caused the activity difference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first aqueous-phase, one-pot synthesis of a lignin-derived “green” enzyme@MOF/MOM platform that can host enzymes without any limitations on enzyme IEP, molecular weight, and substrate size. The different morphologies and crystallinities of the composites formed by Ca-DDVA and Zn-DDVA MOMs broaden their applications depending on the problem of interest. Our approach of enzyme immobilization not only improves the sustainability/reusability of almost all enzymes but also reduces/eliminates the use of non-sustainable resources. This synthesis method has a negligible environmental impact while the products are non-toxic to living things and the environment. The biocompatibility also makes it possible to carry out enzyme delivery/release for nutritional or biomedical applicationsviaour “green” biocomposites. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Biocatalysts; Biocompatibility; Catalysis; Composite materials; Environmental impact; Heavy metals; Lignin; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Molecular weight; Nutrition; Organometallics; Reusability; Sustainable development; Catalytic efficiencies; Co-crystallizations; Environmental conservation; Enzyme biocatalysis; Iso-electric points; Metal organic materials; Non-sustainable resources; One-pot synthesis; Enzyme immobilization; Catalysts; Composites; Heavy Metals; Molecular Weight; Nutrition",Article,Scopus

Herein, we present a facile strategy for the fabrication of magnetic structural-functional materials with superhydrophobicity using ATP (attapulgite) as a skeleton. Various characterization results revealed that the prepared magnetic ATP nanocomposites including mFe/ATP@Sh (magnetic ATP with a shell containing mercapto groups) with the thickest superhydrophobic silicone polymer shell behaved as a ""protective barrier""to cover in the framework of magnetic ATP. Owing to the strong hydrophobicity and excellent magnetic responsivity of this architecture, it provides an excellent structural platform for diverse applications. Therefore, magnetic ATP nanocomposites were tested for various applications such as adsorbent for nitrobenzene, superhydrophobic coating and water/oil separation. Accordingly, mFe/ATP@Sh exhibited a good magnetic separation performance and superhydrophobicity/superoleophilicity, thus displaying high uptake toward nitrobenzene in the aqueous phase and easy separation by an external magnet after multiple cycles. Furthermore, the mFe/ATP@Sh-PDMS coating exhibited superhydrophobicity on different substrates, good mechanical properties in artificial rain tests and good resistance and stability to harsh environments. Especially, the mFe/ATP@Sh sheet with chemical stability and good magnetism exhibited excellent separation stability (>99%) for oil/water mixtures over a wide pH range and extraordinary reusability without the material particle shedding.

Here, Fe3+:ZnO has been deployed on ceramic plats (CP) using SILAR method for solar photocatalytic mineralization of HA in municipal wastewater. Structural results show that ZnO and Fe3+:ZnO deployed over CP have an average crystallite size of 47.43 nm and 29.54 nm, respectively. Further, Fe3+ doping increased the conductivity of ZnO due to enhanced photon capturing ability and effective surface area. Almost 90% HA photodegradation was achieved at the reaction parameters optimized by response surface methodology. Owing to the strong interaction between negatively charged HA and positive zeta potential of ZnO@CP (24 mV) and Fe3+:ZnO@CP (26 mV). Moreover, a significant reduction in BOD (~73%), COD (~76%) and TOC (~63%) have been observed after solar photocatalytic treatment of municipal wastewater. In comparison, ZnO@CP hybrid removed HA (400 mgL−1) at the rate of 3.3 kgm−3d−1 with a lower reduction in BOD (~57%), COD (~45%) and TOC (~57%) than Fe3+:ZnO@CP, confirming that the Fe doping has tuned the bandgap and manipulated the active sites onto the surface of ZnO. Moreover, direct coating of photocatalyst over CP provided exceptional stability and reusability as a photocatalyst which maintained ~80% of its activity even after 14 cycles of wastewater treatment and only lose 29% of its activity after 22 cycles.

These metal-free catalysts were used successfully for the first time in the NaBH4 methanolysis reaction (NaBH4-MR). The structural and physical-chemical properties of the metal-free catalysts obtained were analysed by XRD (X-ray diffraction), elemental analysis (CHNS), FT-IR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), and nitrogen adsorption surface analyses.

One of the most expensive components of a RLV is the thermal protection system (TPS), which preserves the spacecraft from the high thermal loads during re-entry. Reusability and on-orbit environment are key parameters in TPS design, mainly as far as the adopted materials are concerned. Aim of the work is to analyze a novel TPS concept, proposing an hybrid multiscale ceramic coating - i.e., alumina-based varnish enriched by silica nanoparticles - to be applied on Carbon/Carbon (C/C) plates. The treatment is aimed at preserving the thermo-mechanical properties of the ceramic substrate from the detrimental space environment conditions, such as LEO thermal cycles, outgassing due to ultra-high vacuum, as well as Atomic Oxygen/UV irradiation. Experimental measurements of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) are performed in order to evaluate the thermal stress and performance of both substrate and coating layer. Particular emphasis is devoted to evaluate the effect of coating/substrate adhesion, which may result in anomalous mechanical behavior. By the use of a robust numerical technique, known as the inverse method, heat capacity and thermal conductivity are analyzed; such approach is particularly suited to address these kind of problems, as a number of physical parameters concur for a reliable determination of material properties.

The modular joint is a prefabricated, nodal connector composed of a weldment/built-up section of webs and flanges that includes a starter segment for each connecting member. It joins standard rolled wide flange sections through bolted splice connections in double shear. Flanges and webs are connected independently, forming a moment-resisting connection. This provides flexural stiffness for truss-like or beam-like behavior and provides the potential for the structure to tolerate member loss. The flange splice plates connecting the joint and any member can be bent to varying angles to achieve a variable depth geometry. This is a ""kit-of-parts""approach, where members are standard sections and the prefabricated modular joint can be repeated throughout a single structure and also used for many structures. Although this approach retains all the advantages of modular construction (e.g., prefabrication, mass production, rapid erection, and reusability), it overcomes the prime deficiency of the existing technologies that a fixed panel size limits the span length. This paper investigates this approach through (1) developing a methodology to achieve rational constant- and variable-depth bridge forms, (2) performing structural optimization for minimum self-weight while meeting structural performance demands and transportability criteria, and (3) demonstrating the promise of this approach through detailed finite element numerical analyses. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Accelerated bridge construction; Modular construction; Optimization; Steel truss","Fabrication; Flanges; Modular construction; Reusability; Starters; Structural optimization; Bolted splices; Finite element numerical analysis; Flexural stiffness; Mass production; Modular joints; Moment-resisting connection; Single structure; Structural performance; Steel bridges",Article,Scopus

In this study, manganese oxyhydroxide (MnOOH) was used as an activator for PS to degrade p-chloroaniline (PCA) from wastewater. The effects of MnOOH dosage, PS dosage and initial pH on PCA degradation performance were studied. Experimental results showed that PCA degradation efficiency was enhanced by higher MnOOH and PS addition, and the degradation efficiency was slightly inhibited as the initial pH increased from 3 to 9. MnOOH showed excellent stability and reusability when used as the activator of PS. In addition, a comprehensive study was conducted to determine the PS activation mechanism. The results revealed that PS activation by MnOOH followed a nonradical mechanism. No 1O2 was generated, and the main active substance in the reaction was the activated PS molecule on the surface of MnOOH. The hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface acted as a bridge connecting PS and the catalyst, leading to the activation of PS. The intermediates during PCA degradation were also analyzed, and three possible degradation pathways of PCA were proposed.

However, most of these possess nanometer size and small pores, which are difficult to recover them from the reaction medium and present low immobilization efficiency and protein loading capacity, and high substrate diffusion limitations. Herein, a novel magnetic amino-functionalized zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) with 3D highly ordered macroporous structure was synthesized using the assembled polystyrene (PS) nanosphere monoliths as a template. Subsequently, catalase (CAT) molecules were immobilized on the surface of macroporous magnetic ZIF-8 and inside the macropores by precipitation, covalent binding and cross-linking. The resultant immobilized CAT showed high immobilization efficiency (58%) and protein loading capacity (29%), leading to 500% higher activity than the immobilized CAT on ZIF-8 (CAT/ZIF-8). Meanwhile, the immobilized CAT could be easily recovered with a magnet without obvious activity loss. The traditional CAT/ZIF-8 lost its activity after 6 cycles, whereas, the immobilized CAT retained 90% activity of its initial activity after reusing for 8 cycles, indicating excellent reusability. In conclusion, this study provides a facile and efficient approach to immobilize enzymes on/in MOFs with enhanced activity and excellent recyclability. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Immobilization efficiency; Immobilized enzymes; Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs); Ordered macropores structure; Polystyrene template","Efficiency; Magnetism; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Reusability; Immobilization efficiency; Immobilizing enzymes; Macroporous metals; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Ordered macroporous; Structural diversity; Substrate diffusion; Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8; Enzyme immobilization; ammonium sulfate; catalase; fluorescein isothiocyanate; functional group; glutaraldehyde; imidazole derivative; immobilized enzyme; magnetic nanoparticle; metal organic framework; microsphere; nanosphere; polystyrene; silane derivative; zeolite; zeolite; adsorption; Article; centrifugation; confocal laser scanning microscopy; contact angle; covalent bond; cross linking; crystal structure; data analysis software; desorption; enzyme activity; enzyme immobilization; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; magnetometry; maximum reaction velocity; Michaelis Menten kinetics; pore size; porosity; precipitation; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; surface property; synthesis; thermogravimetry; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; magnetism; Catalase; Enzymes, Immobilized; Magnetic Phenomena; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Zeolites",Article,Scopus

This work investigates the real capabilities of cryptomelane as an oxidation catalyst. In particular, the preferential CO oxidation (CO-PROX), has been studied as a simple reaction model. When doped with copper, the cryptomelane-based material has revealed a great potential, displaying a comparable activity to the high-performance CuO/CeO2. Despite stability concerns that compromise the primary catalyst reusability, CuO/cryptomelane is particularly robust in the presence of CO2 and H2O, typical components of realistic CO-PROX streams. The CO-PROX reaction mechanism has been assessed by means of isotopic oxygen pulse experiments. Altogether, CuO/ CeO2 shows a greater oxygen lability, which facilitates lattice oxygen enrolment in the CO-PROX mechanism. In the case of CuO/ cryptomelane, in spite of its lower oxygen mobility, the intrinsic structural water co-assists as active oxygen species involved in CO-PROX. Thus, the presence of moisture in the reaction stream turns out to be beneficial for the stability of the cryptomelane structure, besides aiding into the active oxygen restitution in the catalyst. Overall, this study proves that CuO/cryptomelane is a promising competitor to CuO/CeO2 in CO-PROX technology, whose implementation can bring the CO-PROX technology and H2 purification processes a more sustainable nature. © 2021 American Chemical Society","Cerium oxide; CO-PROX; Cryptomelane; Isotopic oxygen; Oxygen exchange; Rare earths; Reaction mechanism","Catalysts; Ionization of gases; Manganese oxide; Oxidation; Oxygen; Reusability; Active oxygen species; Catalyst reusability; Co-prox reactions; Oxidation catalysts; Physicochemical features; Preferential CO oxidation; Purification process; Structural water; Copper oxides",Article,Scopus

It possessed superparamagnetic property, large specific surface area, moderate pore volume and excellent chemical stability. Benefiting from this unique structure, it exhibited superb adsorption performance. Its maximum adsorption capacities were 158.98 mg g−1 for CR at 298 K with pH = 4 and 86.73 mg g−1 for Cr(VI) at 298 K with pH = 5, which were larger than most of other similar adsorbent. The adsorption reaction followed the Langmuir model as well as pseudo-second-order rate equation. The higher temperature was in favour of adsorption. The ionic strength showed little effect on the sorption Cr(VI). Furthermore, the possible formation mechanism of this composite and its adsorption mechanism were also proposed. Overall, this new composite is expected to be an excellent adsorbent for CR and Cr (VI) in wastewater due to its superior structural stability, high efficiency, good reusability, and easy collection by magnetic separation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption performance; Congo red and Cr(VI) pollutants; Core-shell structure; Layered double hydroxides; Magnetic separation","Adsorption; Aluminum compounds; Azo dyes; Chemical stability; Composite structures; Ionic strength; Iron oxides; Magnesium compounds; Magnetic separation; Magnetite; Microspheres; Reusability; Silica; Silicon; Adsorption performance; Hierarchical porous structures; Large specific surface areas; Layered double hydroxides; Magnetic microspheres; Pseudo-second-order rate equation; Structural stabilities; Superparamagnetic property; Chromium compounds",Article,Scopus

In order to make a comparison, a series of composites comprising g-C3N4and Ce-MOF were synthesized as well. Their structural features were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), sorption of nitrogen (BET and BJH), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) techniques. According to the obtained results, it was found that nanosheets of mesoporous g-C3N4act as linkers between the cerium sites, playing a critical role in the formation of composites. In fact, the embedded g-C3N4nanoparticles in the Ce-MOF cause a new kind of meso-porosity. Moreover, the coordination of nitrogen atoms in the graphitic carbon nitride structure to cerium atoms of the crystal brings about substantial changes in the optical properties, increasing the photoreactivity. On the other hand, since there is a physical contact between Ce-UiO-66 and g-C3N4in the composite, the unaltered pore volume and optical properties lead to the formation of a physical mixture rather than a composite. The g-C3N4@Ce-MOF as a photocatalyst was employed in photocatalytic aerobic oxidative Hantzsch pyridine synthesis of styrene and indicated high performance under visible light. The stability and reusability of g-C3N4@Ce-MOF were also examined and showed high efficiency up to the 5th run. Besides, the PXRD and FT-IR analyses taken from the retrieved g-C3N4@Ce-MOF nanocomposite confirmed the catalyst stability after the completion of the cascade aerobic oxidative reaction. Despite the photocatalytic performance, the synergistic effect of open metal sites in the MOF as Lewis acid and nitrogen in g-C3N4have greatly improved the efficiency of the catalyst. Moreover, the study of the reaction mechanism using ESR indicates the positive effect of composite formation on the performance of the photocatalytic aerobic oxidation reaction by the superoxide radical (O2˙—), as a selective oxidant species. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 2021.",,"Cerium; Crystal atomic structure; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Graphitic Carbon Nitride; Heterojunctions; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Magnetic moments; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Nanocatalysts; Nanosheets; Nitrogen; Organometallics; Photocatalytic activity; Photoreactivity; Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Styrene; Synthesis (chemical); Thermogravimetric analysis; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Composite formation; Diffuse reflectance-UV-vis; Energy dispersive x-ray; Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy; Oxidative functionalization; Photocatalytic performance; Powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD); X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; cerium; graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet; metal organic framework; nanosheet; nitrogen; pyridine derivative; styrene; unclassified drug; Article; diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; electron spin resonance; electron transport; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; oxidation; oxidation reduction reaction; photocatalysis; polymerization; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; surface area; synergistic effect; synthesis; thermogravimetry; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray fluorescence spectrometry; X ray powder diffraction",Article,Scopus

The most viable clean, green and alternative energy carrier is hydrogen that can meet out the challenges posed towards energy scarcity. So, the present work focus on the effective storing of hydrogen on non-carboneous (Ah-BN) and hydrogen rich metal hydride (NaBH4) based storage medium. where a facile chemical impregnated method was adopted for the preparation of NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite. The structural, morphological, elemental composition and specific surface area analysis of the prepared NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite confirms the presence of NaBH4 wrapped around Ah-BN and enhanced specific surface area of 154.4 m2 g −1 (NaBH4/Ah-BN) from 68.2 m2 g −1 (Ah-BN). The presence of NaBH4 not only increases the specific surface area but also increases the pore volume thereby creating more defects. In contrast the presence of Ah-BN drastically reduces the decomposition temperature of NaBH4. The amount of stored hydrogen (Sievert's-like hydrogenation setup) was 3.8 wt% at 119 °C and the binding energy falls in the recommended range (0.33 −0.50 eV) of US-Department of Energy (DOE) 2025 targets. All the thermal analysis [thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)] ensures the two-step dehydrogenation for NaBH4/Ah-BN. Moreover, the utilization of NaBH4/Ah-BN as an electrode to store hydrogen electrochemically reveals the attainment of 2550 mAh/g discharge capacity during 15 cycles that equals to 4.10 wt% hydrogen storage capacity. Hence, these excellent characteristics proved that the prepared NaBH4/Ah-BN nanocomposite may serve as an excellent weakly chemisorbed hydrogen storage system and electrode material to store hydrogen electrochemically in the realm of Hydrogen Fuel cells. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Activated hexagonal boron nitride (Ah-BN); Electrochemical hydrogen storage; Hydrogen storage capacity; Reusability; Sodium borohydride (NaBH4)","Binding energy; Differential scanning calorimetry; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Global warming; Gravimetric analysis; Hydrides; Nanocomposites; Sodium Borohydride; Specific surface area; Temperature programmed desorption; Thermoanalysis; Thermogravimetric analysis; Alternative energy source; Decomposition temperature; Global warming and climate changes; Hydrogen storage capacities; Hydrogen storage medium; Hydrogen storage system; Solid-state hydrogen storage; US Department of Energy; Hydrogen storage",Article,Scopus

High Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was applied to characterize the anthocyanin extract. The surface morphology and structural characterization of the generated nanofibers were explored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (EDS). The generated electrospun PVA-AC nanofibrous film displayed an average diameter of 150-250nm. They were firstly cross-linked using the vapors of glutaraldehyde to turn them into water-insoluble nanofibers. Both selectivity and detection limit have been also studied. The anthocyanin-containing nanofibers display an excellent simplicity and reusability with a limit of detection in the range between 1 and 350mg/L. The detection limit was monitored as low as 1mg/L. PVA-AC showed excellent selectivity compared to other transition metal ions, including Cu2+, Mg2+, Hg2+, Co2+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Cr3+, Al3+, Ca2+, K+, Na+, Cd2+ and Mn2+. The best optimized conditions for the detection of Fe3+ was achieved in a pH range from 3.75 to 6.0. The proposed assay has the advantage of rapidity, simplicity, facile fabrication, low cost, environmental safety and easy to operate compared to other detection techniques. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.","Anthocyanin extract; Colorimetric sensor; Electrospun nanofibers; Ferric ions; Polyvinyl alcohol","Color; Colorimetry; High performance liquid chromatography; Iron compounds; Mass spectrometry; Metal ions; Morphology; Nanofibers; Polyvinyl alcohols; Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Surface morphology; Transition metals; Colorimetric sensors; Electrospun nanofibers; Energy dispersive X ray analyzer; High performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometries; Optimized conditions; Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA); Spectroscopic probes; Structural characterization; Anthocyanins",Article,Scopus

While transitioning from a linear production system to a closed-loop system is not straightforward, adequate methodology and tools can support industrialists in this sustainable shift. This paper proposes a multi-tool approach to systematically identify, classify, and assess the contribution of influence parameters and action levers to close the loop on products and key materials. Industrial ecology and model-based engineering tools are combined to ensure a systemic analysis and evaluation. The developed multi-tool approach combines, in a stepwise methodology, material flow analysis, fuzzy cognitive mapping, structural analysis, and system dynamics, to model and qualify the impact of potential and promising CE strategies. To illustrate each step of this multi-tool methodology, a case study is carried out on a real-world industrial product: a catalytic converter, which contains a non-negligible amount of platinum, considered as a critical raw material by the European Commission. New insights to close the loop on platinum from catalytic converters are thus provided and discussed. Notably, the connections between key action levers to close the loop on platinum are identified and highlighted, including regulations to limit the number of exports, mandatory recycling and reuse rate, end-users behaviors, based on regulatory constraints and financial motivations, and platinum price fluctuation. These findings could help to generate and fine-tune an ad hoc system dynamics model to evaluate the impact of key action levers through more specific scenarios. For instance, the broader implication of this multi-tool methodology could support an original equipment manufacturer in the evaluation of potential CE strategies, through the simulation of selected action levers on the circularity and sustainability performance of their value chain. Ultimately, it could provide quantitative insights to relevant prospective questions, such as, what if a take-back scheme is proposed to augment the collection rate by a given percentage, or what if the design is modified for easy disassembly. © 2021","case study; Circular economy; circularity; fuzzy cognitive mapping; material flow analysis; platinum; structural analysis; system dynamics","Closed loop systems; Competition; Platinum; Sustainable development; System theory; Competitive advantage; Critical raw materials; Financial motivation; Fuzzy cognitive mappings; Material flow analysis; Model-based engineering; Original equipment manufacturers; Sustainability performance; Catalytic converters",Article,Scopus

The novelin situH2O association was subsequently aligned towards C-O-C active sites of GrO and f-(SA)GrO surfaces on a mechanistic HO˙ release with efficient sonothermocatalysis. Compared to GrO, the electronic bandwidth of heterogeneous f-(SA)GrO structure is reduced from 4.00 to 3.67 eV at 280 nm excitation. The contribution of heteroatoms (-N) of f-(SA)GrO at near-edges could have a greater bandwidth efficacy due to synergistic effect. The composition-driven structural alignments with near-edges have been investigated with synchrotron radiation soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Efficient photoluminescent bandwidth structures at 3.67 and 1.87 eV for f-(SA)GrO and 4.00, 2.04 and 1.46 eV for GrO with their corresponding surface quantized electronic density contour images, photon flux, and power density were investigated.

As their presence in water becomes increasingly common due to progressively enhanced usage, there is a need for effective removal technologies. Thus, succinic acid-terminated generation-5 poly(amidoamine) (G-5 PAMAM) was coupled to amine-functionalized Santa Barbara Amorphous-15 (SBA-15-NH2) silica to obtain G-5 PAMAM-functionalized SBA-15-NH2 (or PSBA). This was characterized and employed for low-concentration-solution ivermectin adsorption by investigating the adsorption rate r (15 ≤ r ≤ 1440 min), effects of pH (3 ≤ pH ≤ 11), concentration Co (100 ≤ Co ≤ 600 μg/L), the temperature T (19.5 ≤ T ≤ 39.5 °C), and reusability at varying temperatures. Adsorption data were described using kinetics and adsorption isotherm models and thermodynamics. The PSBA Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra exhibited typical silanol bands but lost the characteristic silanol hydroxyl group, while gaining -CH and amide-linked bands. The thermal stability was less than that of SBA-15 but more than that of SBA-15-NH2, while both low- and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra presented typically well-defined structural pore postfunctionalization with the primary SBA-15 structural lattice unchanged in PSBA. The PSBA Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area, pore volume, and size are of intermediate values compared to those of pristine SBA-15 and SBA-15-NH2. The ivermectin adsorption equilibrium was fast (60 min), accompanied by a very fast rate, and ≥81% adsorption occurred within this time. The process is somewhat pH-dependent with dual adsorption peaks at pH values ≈3 and ≈11. Adsorption was concentration-dependent, increasing accordingly. Adsorption increased with temperature but subsequently decreased with further increase in temperature. The process was spontaneous and overall exothermic with increased disorderliness of ivermectin molecules in solution as the temperature increased. The adsorption models suggested that the process occurred by the transfer of surface electrons, which resulted in electrostatic interactions between the adsorption sites and ivermectin molecules. Adsorption likely occurred at heterogeneous adsorption sites that were energetically distinct, and the process was accompanied by multilayer adsorption on the initial layer of adsorbed ivermectin. Overall, the process was majorly influenced by a concentration-dependent external ivermectin mass transfer. PSBA could reduce ivermectin in low-concentration solutions to ≈3.2 μg/L from a <75 μg/L solution at any of the studied temperatures. The PSBA adsorption capacity (479.4 μg/g) is comparatively better than those of most adsorbents currently reported in the literature. The reusability of PSBA is promising for water treatment even after three consecutive reuse cycles with over 84% adsorption capacity retained. ©","avermectin; ivermectin aqueous extraction; SBA-15-NH2; solution pH; sorption of ivermectin; succinic acid-terminated generation-5 poly(amidoamine) (G-5 PAMAM)","Adsorption isotherms; Amides; Cobalt; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Mass transfer; Molecules; Reusability; Silica; Temperature; Water conservation; Water pollution; Water treatment; Adsorption isotherm model; Brunauer-emmett-teller surface areas; Concentration-dependent; Conventional water treatment; Fourier transform infrared; Post-functionalization; Toxicological effects; Wide angle Xray diffraction; Adsorption",Article,Scopus

To test the feasibility of incorporating this waste into ceramic materials, this study examined the reuse of glass wool as a fluxing agent in the production of clay- and waste-based building ceramics. Commercial kaolin clay and two industrial residues, namely quartz-feldspar sand (QFS) and copper slag (CS), were selected as the precursors. Six compositions were prepared, three samples containing glass wool and three counterparts without glass wool, and then sintered at 750, 850, and 950 °C. The materials and prepared ceramics were characterized by employing x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), water absorption, apparent density, and compressive and flexural strength tests. Interestingly, the results indicated that incorporating 10 wt% of glass wool into the QFS, CS, and kaolin mixtures created ceramics with better physical, mechanical, and microstructural properties. This was ascribed to the glass wool melting reactions observed from approximately 700 °C. The QFS samples with glass wool and sintered at 950 °C achieved compressive strength values as high as 117 MPa and water absorption percentages as low as 2%. However, the fluxing effect of glass wool was less significant in the CS- and kaolin-based ceramics, likely due to differences in their chemical composition, mineralogy, and particle-size distribution. The results of this study emphasize the reuse potential of glass wool and other waste streams in building ceramics and could contribute to improving the management of glass wool waste in line with social sustainability objectives. © 2020 The Authors","Building ceramics; Copper slag; Fluxing agent; Glass wool; Kaolin; Quartz-feldspar sand","Building materials; Ceramics industry; Clay; Compressive strength; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Feldspar; Glass; Kaolin; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Sintering; Slags; Waste management; Water absorption; Wool; Yarn; Apparent density; Building ceramics; Chemical compositions; Compressive and flexural strengths; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Industrial residues; Micro-structural properties; Social sustainability; Glass industry",Article,Scopus

Particular focus is given to the mix rationale and optimisation process as well as possible routes of exploitation of such materials in construction elements. The experimental assessments showed that such composite materials meet the strength and durability criteria for direct application in practice. The best balance in terms of strength and workability was achieved for a waste glass-to-plastic aggregate ratio of 92/8. The presence of relatively large amounts of recycled waste glass particles with small sizes acted as secondary hydration products and contributed to achieving an adequate strength of the material.

The adsorption data were explained with kinetics and adsorption isotherm models. PGOSBA is mesoporous, but has lower Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore dimensions in comparison to the amine-functionalized SBA-15 (SBA-15-NH2). Infrared spectra peaks peculiar to the individual constituents were observed in the PGOSBA, which exhibited thermal stability in-between those of its SBA-15-NH2 and graphene oxide (GO) constituents. The basic structural lattices of individual constituents were unaffected in the PGOSBA morphology, which was covered by GO sheet-like structures. The adsorption of Cd(II), As(III), ciprofloxacin, and ivermectin attained equilibrium at 240, 20, 180, and 720 min, respectively. The adsorption rate data for Cd(II) fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetics model, while As(III), ciprofloxacin, and ivermectin adsorption fitted the fractal pseudo-second-order kinetics model better. PGOSBA exhibited one optimum adsorption pH for Cd(II) (pH 5), while two pH points were recorded for ivermectin (a lower peak at pH 3 and a higher one at pH 9). The Cd(II) and ivermectin adsorption processes were spontaneous and endothermic; an increase in temperature up to ≈30 °C slightly enhanced Cd(II) adsorption (≤5%), as well as ivermectin (≥15%), but to an extent; a higher temperature increase (≈40 °C) may result in lower adsorption (≤2%) than at ≈30 °C. Multiple sorption phenomena including electrostatic interactions, multilayer adsorption due to π-πinteractions, as well as pore filling were involved in the pollutants removal processes. The PGOSBA adsorption capacities for Cd(II), As(III), tetracycline, and ciprofloxacin are 92.4, 22.3, 29.2, and 24.6 mg/g, respectively, while it is 291.8 μg/g for ivermectin. The adsorbent could lower ivermectin in low-concentration ivermectin solutions (<80 μg/L) to less than 8.5 μg/L. The PGOSBA reusability for ivermectin adsorption over three consecutive cycles of adsorption, desorption, and reuse was ≥95%. These results imply that the PGOSBA adsorbent would be economically viable for potential use in water treatment processes. ©",,"Adsorption; Antibiotics; Graphene; Kinetics; Mesoporous materials; Morphology; Pollution; Reusability; Water treatment; Adsorption isotherm model; Amine-functionalized SBA-15; Brunauer-emmett-teller surface areas; Functionalized graphene; Mesoporous composites; Multilayer adsorption; Pseudo second order kinetics; Water treatment process; Cadmium compounds",Article,Scopus

Ceramic bricks were made in accordance with the following variables: replacement percentage (10% and 15%), compaction pressure (28 and 35 MPa), drying temperature (65 °C for 72 h and 110 °C for 24 h), and firing temperature (950 and 1100 °C). Technological tests evaluated the drying and firing linear shrinkage, firing specific weight, water absorption, and resistance to uniaxial compression. After determining the optimal conditions, a flexural tear test and microstructural characterization were also performed. The optimal conditions for making ceramic bricks were a replacement percentage of 15%, compaction pressure of 35 MPa, drying temperature of 65 °C (72 h), and firing temperature of 1100 °C. These results were favorable because of the partial thermal decomposition of the mineral phases with the recrystallization of mullite and cristobalite.

Multiprong approaches are practiced such as chemical precipitation, reverse osmosis, ion-exchange, adsorption by granular activated carbon etc. to capture and separate this “Group A” human carcinogenic effluent from water. However, low capture capacity, non-reusability, poor selectivity, pH-limited performance are some major limitations of these techniques. Recently, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), metal organic cages (MOCs), porous organic polymers (POPs) or covalent organic frameworks (COFs), covalent organic networks (CONs) etc. emerged as new-generation materials to overcome such limitations. However, the development is still in initial stage and issues related to structural stability and integrity of many MOFs in water and in wide pH range, as well as reusability need to be addressed. At this juncture, herein we report a novel [Zn(terpyridine)2]2+-templated trisimidazolium-based highly cationic three-dimensional metal-organic coordination assembly (3D MOCA), serving as a new class of efficient, fast, robust and recyclable dichromate-removal material. Not only the highly cationic assembly is enriched with a high density of Br− anions, but its three-dimensional propagation and flexibility also exposes the exchangeable Br− ions for facile anion-metathesis with Cr2O72−. By virtue of the benefits of these attributes, the presented supramolecular material exhibits a high capture capacity (469 mg g−1), fast exchange kinetics (0.028 g mg−1 min−1), wide working pH range (pH 2–12) and reusability up to a minimum of 10 cycles without much loss of efficiency.

There are three main ways of dealing with polymer waste: reuse in an un-changed form, recycling (both material and energy), and disposal (mainly in the form of landfilling or incineration). The legislation of European countries promotes in particular two forms of waste management: reuse and recycling. Recycling processes are used to recover materials and energy especially from contaminated waste, which are structurally changed by other materials, friction, temperature, machine, process, etc. The recycling of polymers, especially of multi-plastic structural elements, requires the use of special technological installations and a series of preparatory opera-tions, including crushing and separating. Due to the universality and necessity of materials processing in recycling engineering, in particular size reduction, the aim of this study is to organize and systematize knowledge about shredding in the recycling process of end-of-life polymeric materials. This could help properly design these processes in the context of sustainable development and circular economy. Firstly, an overview of the possibilities of end-of-life plastics management was made, and the meaning of shredding in the end-of-life pathways was described. Then, the development of comminution in recycling processes was presented, with special emphasis given to quasi-cutting as the dominant mode of comminution of polymeric materials. The phenomenon of quasi-cutting, as well as factors related to the material, the operation of the shredding machine, and the technological process affecting it were described. Research conducted on quasi-cutting as a phenomenon when cutting single material samples and quasi-cutting as a machine process was char-acterized. Then, issues regarding recycling potentials in the context of shredding were systematized. Considerations included the areas of material, technical, energy, human, and control potentials. Presented bases and models can be used to support the innovation of creative activities, i.e., environmentally friendly actions, that produce specific positive environmental results in the mechanical processing of recycled and reused materials. The literature survey indicates the need to explore the environmental aspect of the shredding process in recycling and connect the shredding process var-iables with environmental consequences. This will help to design and control the processes to get the lowest possible environmental burdens. © 2021 by the authors.

Therefore, there is a need for an economically viable and effective way to recognise and sort textile materials. Automated recognition and sorting lines provide a method for ensuring better quality of the fractions being recycled and thus enhance the availability of such fractions for recycling. The aim of this study was to deepen the understanding of NIR spectroscopy technology in the recognition of textile materials by studying the effects of structural fabric properties on the recognition. The identified properties of fabrics that led non-matching recognition were coating and finishing that lead different recognition of the material depending on the side facing the NIR analyser. In addition, very thin fabrics allowed NIRS to penetrate through the fabric and resulted in the non-matching recognition. Additionally, ageing was found to cause such chemical changes, especially in the spectra of cotton, that hampered the recognition. © 2021 by the authors.

Adhesion is achieved by the formation of amorphous calcium carbonate/polyacrylic acid hydrogel, and tunable cooling is achieved by the absorption of a phase change material into the hydrogel. Structural, thermal and electrical characterizations of this dual-function hydrogel are done. Reusability of the hydrogel by water swelling is also demonstrated. After optimization of the composition, applications of this hydrogel for backsheet and PV panel are evaluated, and according to our design, rough stable 70 Wm−2 cooling power could be obtained using only 0.5 g optimized hydrogel on a standard six-inch PV panel without weakening the conversion efficiency, and consequential power output gain is also proved.

The physicochemical properties and structural morphology of Sch@BC were explored using XRD, SEM, BET, and XPS. The results showed that introducing biochar can effectively prevent the agglomeration of Sch. The catalytic activity of Sch@BC in the Fenton-like degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was also systematically investigated under different reaction conditions. Under optimum conditions ([SMX] = 10 mg L−1, [H2O2] = 2.0 mM, Sch@BC = 1.0 g L−1 and initial pH = 3.0), the removal efficiencies of the SMX and total organic carbon (TOC) were 100% and 45.9%, respectively, within 60 min of the reaction. The results of the radical scavenger effect and ESR studies suggested that the SMX degradation in the Sch@BC/H2O2 system was dominated by a heterogeneous Fenton-like reaction. The repeated use of Sch@BC for SMX degradation demonstrated its reusability and stability in Fenton-like reactions. There was also speculation about the degradation mechanism and pathways of SMX. Furthermore, under the same conditions, the removal efficiencies of sulfadiazine (SD) and sulfisoxazole (SIZ) under Fenton-like degradation in the Sch@BC system were 91% and 93%.

Transportable modules will ease the process of returning the modules to the factory for reuse and recycling of structural steel at the end of their lifetime. A previous comparison between the proposed case studies has shown that the off-grid case can reduce the global warming potential by 76% in Shanghai when compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Generally, there is only a limited number of studies of container buildings with a simulation of the annual energy need in the literature. Particularly there is a lack of studies of residential buildings designed for off-grid operation. This study expands a previous study of the case buildings by improved control strategies in TRNSYS to reduce the required PV capacity and thereby the embodied emissions. For instance, thermal storage has been included to reduce the amount of dumped energy. Also, ventilation and indoor temperature have been controlled based on ambient temperature, state of charge, day, and time. In cold climates, Photovoltaic thermal (PVT), floor heating, and a generator have been added to increase the heating load. The results show that providing thermal comfort in the heating season is the main challenge, both because of the lower coefficient of performance for the heat pump and due to the lower PV generation. According to the predicted effects of climate change, the energy need for space heating is predicted to be reduced by on average 23% towards 2050 for the five climate zones in China which are considered, which would make it easier to provide thermal comfort. The current study helps to provide a reference to lower the costs for planning and improve the quality.

Structural characterizations such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD) proved the valence band alignment at Bi/SnO2/TiO2-G interfaces and crystallinity of the nanocomposite, respectively.

The examined clay minerals from local deposits and the optimal conditions for their heat treatment (at 1,100 °C) have been proposed for the sorption removal of pollutants of inorganic origin from wastewater. The use of wastewater after its treatment makes it possible to address several tasks at the same time: to protect the environment from pollution by technological wastewater, as well as to reuse wastewater in order to resolve the issue of water scarcity. Ceramic building materials were manufactured based on water purification waste (in the amount of 5 %) and clay raw materials. Their structural-mechanical and physicochemical characteristics have been comprehensively studied. Sintering processes begin at lower temperatures, which is why, with an increase in the annealing temperature to 1,000 °C and higher, their strength rapidly decreases. In the temperature range of 600-1,100 °C, there are possibilities to apply ceramic technology to immobilize heavy metals in ceramic matrices. The prospect of utilizing water purification waste in the technological process of manufacturing inorganic ceramic materials has been shown. The safety of the building materials, manufactured by leaching pollutants from the ceramic samples using various aggressive environments (leaching to 6.4 %, 0.083 mg·cm2/day) has been investigated.

Until now, great achievements have been made in increasing the light absorption of wood-based solar evaporators, mainly through surface carbonization and coating. However, the complicated and cost-intensive preparation process of the light absorption layer prevents its large-scale application. In particular, the carbonized and coated surface could be importantly influenced by the scouring effect of waves and the corrosion of salt water. Herein, a facile, low-cost, and scalable in situ reduction method has been developed to prepared KMnO4 oxidized wood (K-wood) for solar steam generation, which not only shows high evaporation performance but also has high structural stability. In the preparation process, the reaction-product black MnO2 particles will be uniformly distributed on the surface of wood, making the K-wood exhibit a high solar absorbance of about 94%. Moreover, the K-wood could still maintain the inherent high hydrophilicity and excellent thermal insulation performance. Benefitting from all of these advantages, the K-wood achieved a high evaporation rate (1.22 kg m-2 h-1) and a high evaporation efficiency (81.4%) under 1 sun illumination (1 kW m-2). Importantly, the K-wood also exhibits excellent structural stability, such as having good acid-base resistance and also washing resistance, and could even withstand an ultrasound treatment for even 2 h. The reusability of the K-wood was also tested, and the evaporation rate remains nearly unchanged after 20 cycles in seawater evaporation. Moreover, the condensate water obtained by the homemade collection device shows low ion concentrations, demonstrating that the K-wood possesses an excellent ability in seawater desalination treatment. This study provides a simple method to manufacture a high-strength wood-based solar steam evaporation device, which has potential for future large-scale applications. ©","desalination; in situ reduction method; MnO2particles; photothermal; solar steam generation","Carbonization; Corrosion; Desalination; Efficiency; Evaporation; Hydrophilicity; Light absorption; Manganese oxide; Potash; Reusability; Seawater; Stability; Steam; Steam generators; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulation; High evaporation rate; Insulation performance; Large-scale applications; Low thermal conductivity; Seawater desalination; Situ reduction method; Structural stabilities; Ultrasound treatments; Wood",Article,Scopus

The enzyme was assembled in vitro, by using divalent cations as molecular linkers, as stable protein microparticles showing catalytic activity. In this assembled microstructure, β-galactosidase exhibits a particular conformation within the microparticles, sharing structural traits (a high cross-parallel beta-sheet content) with the bacterial inclusion bodies and secretory amyloids from the mammalian endocrine system. This fact confers enhanced thermal stability compared to the soluble protein version and ensures high reusability in industry-oriented processes.

The metal was characterized in the horizontal and vertical build orientations under uniaxial tension to failure in the as-built and machined conditions. Results showed that there was an increase in strength and decrease in ductility of the metal with powder reuse, resulting from rising oxygen content of the powder. The elongation at failure and tensile toughness of the metal exhibited anisotropy, which increased substantially with powder reuse. For the horizontal orientation, the elongation at failure decreased by over 60% in the 30 builds, which was one and a half times greater reduction than that for the vertical orientation.

Thus, the aim is to develop LWAs suitable for use in structural lightweight concrete and other engineering services, using scheelite residue (SPR) and rice husk ash (RHA). Studies show that the production of these residues is increasing, their environmental impacts are significant, and their properties favour the development of LWAs. However, no research was found on the use of SPR in LWAs. Raw materials were characterised by laser granulometry, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction and simultaneous thermal analysis. Then, 23 mixtures were formulated, from the replacement of clay by up to 100% residues. The samples were sintered at 1100, 1150, 1200 and 1250 °C. The manufactured aggregates were characterised by the bloating index (BI), mass loss (LOI), particle density (ρd), water absorption (WA24H), crushing strength (S), mineralogical composition and microstructure. Finally, the feasibility of using the manufactured LWAs was evaluated, based on a comparative analysis with the properties of a commercial LWA. The resulting aggregates showed: (BI) maximum of 77.44%, (LOI) of up to 12.0%, (ρd) varying between 0.86 and 1.80 g/cm3, (WA24H) minimum of 2.0% and (S) up to 13.5 MPa. Overall, 42 specimens demonstrated properties at least similar to the commercial LWA ones. The results reveal that it is technically feasible to use SPR and RHA to produce LWAs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Lightweight aggregate; Reuse; Rice husk ash; Scheelite residue","Aggregates; Environmental impact; Scanning electron microscopy; Sustainable development; Thermoanalysis; Tungstate minerals; Water absorption; Comparative analysis; Engineering service; Laser granulometry; Light weight aggregate; Mineralogical compositions; Simultaneous thermal analysis; Sustainable practices; X ray fluorescence; Light weight concrete",Article,Scopus

On the one hand, Co2+ and Cu2+ was efficiently immobilized on MgMnLDH with maximum quantity of 4.30 and 10.65 mmol g−1, respectively. A series of characterizations reflected the changes in structure and physicochemical properties of MgMnLDH after the immobilization. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) confirmed that the binding modes were lattice substitution for Co2+ and surface precipitation for Cu2+. On the other hand, the immobilized heavy metals enhanced the heterogeneous degradation for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) by peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. Complete degradation was achieved within 10 min in MgMnLDH-Co-4/PMS system and 60 min in MgMnLDH-Cu/PMS system, while only 20% in MgMnLDH/PMS system. The pH adaptability, reusability, stability and activation mechanism of two systems were systematically compared. The superior degradation performance of MgMnLDH-Co-4 benefited from the intense Co/Mn synergism and abundant oxygen vacancies, which could accelerate electron transfer during PMS activation process. The applicability of two catalysis system was confirmed in purifying other antibiotics and actual wastewater.

The efficiency of hydrogen production can be enhanced significantly by use of a catalyst during the reaction. Cobalt borides show significant catalytic activity, but unsupported CoB particles aggregate easily and are difficult to separate from the reaction medium for re-use. The objectives of the present study were to use halloysite (Hly) as a support material to increase the catalytic activity and reusability of a Co metal-based system and to investigate the binary effect of metal loading and reaction parameters on the hydrolysis of NaBH4. Catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation and chemical reduction. The surface morphology and structural properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized using N2 adsorption-desorption and the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

However, its inherent deficiencies, such as the narrow range of photo-response, the fast recombination of photoinduced carriers and the unstable structure, largely limit its further application. In this work, super biocompatible N-doped carbon quantum dots (N-CQD) derived from the green precursor, coconut shells, were in situ grown on MOF-5 via a facile solvothermal method to construction of 0D/3D N-CQD/MOF-5 photocatalyst with an enhanced photoreduction ability. A sustainable and pollution-free preparation process of N-CQD/MOF-5 photocatalyst was delivered and biomass waste resource was effectively utilized via this method. This well-designed photocatalyst with the optimized 1% N-CQD loading presented a considerable photoreduction rate of Cr (VI), which was 2.5 times higher that of pure MOF-5. It also possessed a strong structural stability and reusability even after multiple tests. The boosting photocatalysis activity could be attributed to the doping of N-CQD, who not only act as an electron acceptor to separate the photoexcited electrons and holes effectively, but also play a vital role as a photosensitizer to improve the visible-light absorption. Furthermore, the influence of activation methods on the photocatalytic activity of MOF-5 were also investigated theoretically. For the purpose of clarifying the potentially photocatalytic mechanism of N-CQD/MOF-5 in photoreduction Cr (VI), a series of tests involving photoelectrical characterizations and fluorescence spectroscopy were executed. Therefore, this study provides an innovative photocatalytic system for an enhanced photoreduction performance of Cr (VI) of MOF-5. © 2021","Cr (VI) photoreduction; Metal-organic framework materials; N-doped carbon quantum dots; Photocatalysis activity","Biocompatibility; Carbon Quantum Dots; Chromium metallography; Electron transport properties; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Light absorption; Photocatalytic activity; Photosensitizers; Reusability; Semiconductor doping; Semiconductor quantum dots; Stability; Wastewater treatment; Photocatalytic performance; Photocatalytic systems; Photoexcited electrons; Preparation process; Solvothermal method; Structural stabilities; Unstable structures; Visible light absorption; Chromium compounds",Article,Scopus

The structural and textural properties of the synthesized catalysts were fully characterized by using different techniques such as FTIR, XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption, TEM and SEM. The acidic properties were also studied by using nonaqueous potentiometric titration and FTIR spectra of chemisorbed pyridine techniques. The efficacy of the newly synthesized acid catalysts was tested in the production of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one through three-component coupling based Biginelli reaction and biodiesel production through stearic acid esterification reaction. The obtained results indicate that the MOF 199 preserves its structure without any noteworthy changes after the fruitful incorporation of HPW crystals within its cavities. Furthermore, an extraordinary improvement in both Lewis and Bronsted acid sites is observed as a result of the HPW encapsulation process. The catalytic activity results showed that the catalyst displayed excellent performance, where 98.3% of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-one was obtained over 0.02 g of 50HPWMOF 199 after 2 h at 80 °C using benzaldehyde: ethyl acetoacetate: urea molar ratios of 1:1:1.5.

Moreover, the catalysts also demonstrated excellent reusability in the investigated organic reactions which can be used many consecutive eras without meaningful loss of their catalytic performance. The achieved high catalytic performance of the synthesized catalysts in the Biginelli and esterification reactions are attributed to uniform HPW distribution inside MOF 199 cavities as well as the Lewis acidity property of MOF 199.

The optimized N-doped TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2 nanotubes vs urea @ 1:1 ratio) showed the highest degradation efficiency over methyl orange dye (∼91% in 90 min) and showed the highest rate of H2 evolution (∼19,848 μmol h−1.g−1) under solar light irradiation. Further, the recyclability studies indicated the excellent stability of the photocatalyst for the durable use in both the photocatalytic processes. The observed efficiency was ascribed to the optimized doping of N-atoms into the lattices of TiO2, which enhanced the optical properties by forming new energy levels of N atoms near the valence band maximum of TiO2, thereby increased the overall charge separation and recombination resistance in the system. The improved reusability of photocatalyst is attributed to the doping-induced structural stability in N-doped TiO2. From the observed results, it has been recognized that the established strategy could be promising for synthesizing N-doped TiO2 nanotubes with favorable structural, optical and photocatalytic properties towards dye degradation and hydrogen production applications. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Doping; Dye degradation; Hydrogen production; Nanotubes; Photocatalysis; TiO2","Azo dyes; Degradation; Doping (additives); Hydrogen production; Metabolism; Nanotubes; Optical lattices; Optical properties; Photocatalytic activity; Reusability; Stability; Titanium dioxide; Titanium metallography; Urea; Degradation efficiency; Photocatalytic dye degradations; Photocatalytic efficiency; Photocatalytic process; Photocatalytic property; Solar light irradiation; Solid-state dispersion; Structural stabilities; Oxide minerals; dye; methyl orange; nanotube; nitrogen; titanium dioxide nanoparticle; urea; titanium; titanium dioxide; catalysis; degradation; dye; hydrogen; nanotube; nitrogen; optimization; photochemistry; solar power; titanium; transmission electron microscopy; Article; crystal structure; decolorization; dispersion; hydrogen evolution; light exposure; photocatalysis; photodegradation; photon; solar radiation; surface property; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; catalysis; light; Catalysis; Light; Nanotubes; Titanium",Article,Scopus

Currently, BIM has been extensively used in both the sketch design (sketch) and detailed design (design) stages. Due to different purposes and different BIM tools, the reusability of sketch BIM models in the design stage is still challenging. To address this issue, this study proposes a building element identification scheme using a segmentation-aggregation strategy, termed EI-SA. Since Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is the international standard of BIM, the EI-SA is built according to the IFC specification. Firstly, the element identification Problem is formally defined, followed by the overall framework of the EI-SA. Then, a presentation-level BIM segmentation algorithm is developed to divide a sketch BIM model into slices of geometric representations. Thirdly, a representation aggregation scheme is proposed to solve the element identification problem. The representation aggregation scheme employs a triangle-triangle intersection to detect the geometric connection and an object recognition algorithm to identify elements. Finally, experiments were conducted on several sketch BIM models. The experiment results showed that the EI-SA identified 82.22% elements on average, which verified the effectiveness of the EI-SA. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to solve the building element identification problem according to IFC. The proposed EI-SA will bridge the gap between sketch BIM models and design BIM models, smooth the reusability of data from the sketch stage to downstream stages, and improve the design efficiency by avoiding the re-designing of building elements. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building information modelling (BIM); Design BIM; Element identification; Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Object recognition; Sketch BIM","Bridges; Building components; Life cycle; Object recognition; Reusability; Structural design; Building Information Modelling; Geometric representation; Identification approach; Identification problem; Industrial foundation class; International standards; Object recognition algorithm; Segmentation algorithms; Architectural design; algorithm; architectural design; building; modeling",Article,Scopus

Combining the favourable features of superwettability and hierarchical rough structure, the NiAlFe LDH/PDA/PVDF membrane could effectively separate a series of oil-in-water emulsions with high efficiency (&gt;99%) and high permeation flux (925–1913 L m−2 h−1 bar−1).

The market of waste unswervingly facilitates the expansion of eco-entrepreneurship and an interdependent web of small startups via material processing and reuse in the regional landscape of an economy. It also opens the door for the macro industry of waste processing and recycling through cross-border trades. All this requires robust policy interventions and bilateral treaties between governments and stakeholders to establish a connection between waste-generating and processing sectors, which are still a part of the current business world.

However, as sensor networks expand, it becomes a challenge to efficiently store, manage, use, or share such data. Such valuable data must be available for reuse by the engineering and the research communities. Here, we present long-term monitoring projects on several long-span bridges in Norway. As a case study, a large dataset from the monitoring of the Hardanger Bridge is presented. A link to the data as well as a permanent DOI will be provided in this paper. The structure and content of the dataset are described here as well as the strategy adopted in permanent storage and publishing. The data repository used for this application is also introduced. In the dataset, both the raw data and “adjusted data” with minimal signal processing (such as resampling, coordinate transformation) are included. The latter are generated in Matlab and shared as *.mat files based on the hdf5 file format.

To fulfil the objectives and in order to ensure Europe's independent and cost-effective space access capabilities, the ASCenSIon (Advancing Space Access Capabilities - Reusability and Multiple Satellite Injection) project, funded by H2020, is connecting fifteen Early-Stage Researchers (ESRs) and twenty-four partner organizations all across Europe. The pillar concept within the project is to adopt a Concurrent Research Network (CRN) methodology. Accordingly, different host institutions, each one with its main research program and vision, are connected to develop the design under a new perspective. This approach emphasises the cooperation between the fifteen ESRs, thus covering the design of a Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) in its overall complexity, facing the new challenges deriving from the required sustainability in a more efficient manner. Corresponding to work package two (WP2) of ASCenSIon, this paper focuses on main stages for RLVs, and how the goal of sustainability affects their design. Therefore, many different interconnected disciplines, such as propulsion system, structural design, fatigue-life analysis and Health Monitoring (HM) have to be taken into consideration. These different domains are represented by the individual research projects of the ESRs, supported by a collaborative environment which promotes the foreseen interactions. At first, this contribution gives a general State-Of-The-Art overview of the mentioned topics. A preliminary trade-off on RLV architectures is established through multi-disciplinary design analysis and optimization methods based on propulsion modelling, optimal staging and structural sizing. These use performance and cost design metrics as objective functions, accounting for operability and maintainability factors. This investigation is then used to discuss the different Advanced Nozzle Concepts (ANCs) tailored on the system requirements and mission constraints. At this point, a one-dimensional performance analysis addresses the performance gain deriving from altitude-compensation properties of ANCs. Subsequently, the identification of a suitable green propellant will give the needed/accurate/required inputs to conduct a trade-off between engine cycles w.r.t. the fatigue-life of their most critical components. Consequently, fatigue-life analysis contributes to HM and sensing requirements for RLV systems. As a common approach between the ESRs, the data collection is organized in various Databases accessible within the network, which encourages their interconnections and collaborative research. This paper provides a preliminary analysis of the above discussed topics and their interconnections within the framework of ASCenSIon, aiming to develop novel technologies for future sustainable main stages.

We propose to overcome this limitation by leveraging fine-grained, method and sentence level, similarities between the artifacts for traceability link recovery. Our approach uses word embeddings and a Word Mover's Distance-based similarity to bridge the semantic gap.

As a result, in today's world, recycling waste into new useful products is the primary concern in any field of engineering. In light of this, the current study used TFF obtained from agro industries and processed into fibers, which were then mixed with an unsaturated polyester matrix to create a natural composite material. Furthermore, by considering process parameters and their levels for conducting experiments, an orthogonal array has been achieved using Taguchi's design approach. The effect of different fiber diameters in relation to various gauge lengths has been recorded, as well as the optimum diameter and length for determining maximum tensile strength using Taguchi's single response study.

It is of interest to know how changing the mission requirements of a vehicle has an impact on the geometry of the inlet. By understanding the flow path that is needed for an inlet to operate at the required pressure recovery and flow conditions of the engine, a relationship between the airframe geometry and propulsion system can be made. This paper presents the development and demonstration of a supersonic inlet sizing tool that will support the synthesis propulsion-airframe integration process at the Aerospace Vehicle Design Laboratory.

Priority is given to rectangular mixed-compression inlets, specifically for supersonic vehicles such as XB-70 and Concorde. A method is verified for a 2D mixed-compression inlet and serves to output the dimensions of length, heights, Mach number along the inlet, deflection angles, and shock angles. The mixed-compression inlet sizing method is expanded to account for the different propulsion systems of the XB-70, Concorde, and Tu-144 to determine their unique inlet geometries.

The structural properties and the catalytic ozonation activity of ZnrAl-T composites synthesized with different Zn/Al molar ratios and calcination temperatures were systematically investigated. Diversified characterizations were applied to analyze the phase structure and chemical composition of ZnrAl-T composites. As the calcination temperature increased, the layered ZnAl-LDH structure could be entirely destroyed and the crystallinity gradually improved. With the Zn/Al mole ratio of 4.0 and calcination temperature of 500°C, the Zn4Al-500 composite obtained the outstanding catalytic ozonation performance for atrazine (ATZ) degradation with the pseudo-first-order constant of 0.5080 min−1, which was 5 times more than that in O3 alone. Meanwhile, the ATZ degradation efficiency was gradually enhanced from 44.1% to 99.9% within 3.0 min when the solution pH ranged from 3.0 to 10.0. Besides, the Zn4Al-500 composite exhibited splendid stability over multiple reaction cycles. In addition, the radical scavenging test and electron spin resonance measurement demonstrated that superoxide radical and hydroxyl radical are the dominant reactive species in O3/Zn4Al-500 process. Moreover, nineteen and ten transformation products were detected in O3 alone and O3/Zn4Al-500 process, and possible degradation pathways of ATZ were further elucidated. Overall, the Zn4Al-500 composite would provide a potential alternative for pollutants removal due to its high catalytic ozonation efficiency, stability, and reusability. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","atrazine; Catalytic ozonation; degradation pathways; layered double hydroxide; mechanisms","Aluminum alloys; Aluminum oxide; Calcination; Catalyst activity; Chemical analysis; Crystallinity; Degradation; Efficiency; Herbicides; Magnetic moments; Molar ratio; Ozone; Ozonization; Reusability; Zinc alloys; Atrazine degradation; Calcination method; Calcination temperature; Catalytic ozonation; Degradation pathways; Hydrothermal methods; Layered double oxide; Layered-double hydroxides; Oxide composites; Zn-Al layered double hydroxides; Binary alloys",Article,Scopus

A two-room model (M1) built with fly ash brick, double-glazed (plain glass) windows with UV rejection film (W1) and a conventional reinforced cement concrete roof was compared with another two-room model (M2) built with construction waste bricks, double-glazed (commercial glass) windows with UV rejection film (W2) and a reinforced cement concrete roof that underwent a reflecting/insulating treatment. The results showed that the thermal transmittance of the wall and the roof of model M2 was reduced by 73% and 25% respectively compared with the wall and roof of model M1.

Many researchers have attempted to reuse this sludge for the development of sustainable construction materials and suggested its optimum usage as a partial substitution for fine aggregate, cement and clay with or without additives for the manufacturing of non-structural building components. This paper provides a critical review of the production of non-structural elements-namely, sustainable building blocks, clay bricks, mortar and paver blocks-using textile effluent treatment plant sludge and recommends optimum ranges of 5-30, 5-40, 5-50 and 20-40%, respectively.

To reach that goal many innovations in construction should be made. One of the first steps is to alter the mainly existing linear construction sequence. Therefore, Royal HaskoningDHV started the innovation of re-using prefabricated concrete girders for new overpasses and bridges. The economic and technical feasibility is researched as well as the impact on climate and emissions. To prove our concept, an overpass is deconstructed, and the 40-year-old prefabricated concrete girders are disassembled and put on transport, instead of crushing them to aggregate. In a temporary storage the girders are inspected, repaired, adapted and certified. So, they are fit for their future use in a new structure. Structural assessments, environmental impact and costs calculations are made for a case study. It is concluded that re-using prefabricated girders is technical and economical feasible, with a remaining lifespan of at least 100 year. Up to 44% of CO2-eq. emissions can be saved and even 61% of abiotic depletion (in Sb-eq.). The main obstacle is the unawareness at the different stakeholders that reusing these high-quality girders is possible and these girders can function for the next century. © 2021 IABSE Congress, Ghent 2021: Structural Engineering for Future Societal Needs.

Structural characteristics were studied through SEM, BET and XRD analyses, evidencing coarse particles with low crystallinity and surface areas of 100–150 m2 g−1, while FT-IR confirmed CO2 interacting with substrate. The load of functional group, particles stability, and CO2 sorption capacity were assessed through elemental and thermogravimetric analysis. It was found that loads of functional groups ranging from 1.6 to 6.1 wt.%. were deposited, and most samples showed sound stability up to 100°C. Sorption capacities were in the range 0.2–1.5 g gNH2−1, the highest being 1.46 g gNH2−1 for ɛ-aminocaproic acid. Such sample also exhibited good recyclability, with a performance drop of 11% after many cycles. CO2 uptake decreased with increasing temperature in the range 25–45°C, suggesting a chemical bond between CO2 and amines.

However, bolted engineering structures often encounter vibration-induced joint faults like self-loosening, crack, leakage and corrosion since they are generally subjected to external dynamic loads caused by vibration environments. Joint damages would seriously affect structures' reliability and durability, and increase maintenance costs. Therefore, fault detection of bolted engineering structures is very important and necessary. For beam-like and ring-type engineering structures with single excitation and multiple damaged bolted joints, various methods monitoring changes in nonlinear structural features have been developed. To avoid the use of structural features from benchmark structures for reference during the derivation of damage indicators, a novel vibration-based fault detection approach utilizing features from damaged structures only is proposed in this study. In the new method, the dynamic model of bolted engineering structures is simplified as a general MDOF model with nonlinear elements simulating nonlinear bolt loosening faults. By changing the value of related mass, three similar equations from the damaged structure are used to form one matrix, and then the singularity of matrix is used to detect the existence and position of faults. Results from simulations on the beam-like and ring-type models with multiple damages demonstrate that the proposed approach could be an effective tool to estimate the state of bolted engineering structures. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

In the present study, graphene oxide (GO) was functionalized with chitosan (CS) and magnetic nanoparticles (Fe-NPs) and tested to remove Sudan I, II, III, and IV dyes from water. The synthesized GO-CS-Fe was characterized using UV–vis, SEM, TEM, EDX, and FTIR spectroscopy, and confirmed the structural composition of nanocomposite, with the Fe-NPs dimension over the GO-CS surface to be 31–44 nm. The effects of various experimental factors; time, pH, adsorbent amount, dyes concentrations, and temperature were executed using the batch experiment. The experimental data were fitted to pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, intraparticle diffusion, and Elovich kinetic models. The isotherm models parameters of the Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich–Peterson, Temkin, and Hill isotherms, along with the thermodynamics parameters were also calculated. The data was explained by the Langmuir isotherm model with maximum adsorption capacities for Sudan I, II, III, and IV as 360.6, 353.7, 351.0, and 347.6 mg/g, respectively. The rapid uptake of the dyes fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic, asserting that the adsorption was diffusion controlled. The process was spontaneous and endothermic in nature. The reusability study of GO-CS-Fe was performed up to five cycles. The nanocomposite can retain its efficacy even after the considered cycles.

Fracture failure in steel structures should be prevented to avoid collapse of the whole structures. Micromechanical fracture models can capture the fracture initiation mechanisms and therefore can be used to predict ductile fractures in steel. Twelve smooth round bars were carried out to obtain the material properties and 36 notched round bars were tested to calibrate the parameters of stress modified critical strain (SMCS) model and the void growth model (VGM) for structural steels (Q235B and Q345B) and the corresponding welds. Specimens were extracted from the base metal, the weld metal and the heat affected zone (HAZ) to investigate fracture behaviour in different parts of the welded joint. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements were taken and finite element models were developed to calibrate the models. The test results and calibrated parameters are reported. Moreover, the calibrated models are applied to analyses the fracture behaviour of welded joints and their accuracy are validated. The calibrated and validated models can be used for further numerical fracture analysis in welded steel structures. © 2021 by The Hong Kong Institute of Steel Construction.

Circular Economy concepts are well suited to the building and construction sector in cities. For example, refurbishing and adaptively reusing underutilized or abandoned buildings can revitalize neighborhoods whilst achieving environmental benefits. A systematic review of the literature and case studies has led to the identification of three areas of action of the CE in the regeneration of the built environment: a Macro-level (the public space), a Micro-level (the single component), a Meso-level (the building). However, the traditional approach of carrying out timely interventions aimed at responding to individual problems, be they of a structural, energetic, functional nature, relating to the building, the context or the single component is not entirely effective in terms of reformulation of the building characteristics. In this perspective, the paper suggests strategies of circular regeneration of residential buildings through adaptive solutions at room level, home level and urban in pursuit of human wellbeing. © 2021, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia.

As design movements became global and mechanical systems evolved to provide ready access to heating and cooling, buildings became less climate responsive and more energy intensive to operate. Architecture of this time also celebrated structural innovation and novel materials, which led to frequent integration of structure, envelope, and systems. These characteristics resulted in a building stock with typically poor energy efficiency and new material challenges for conservation. Rather than a justification to tear down these buildings and replace them, their vast numbers and significant contributions to global greenhouse gas emissions are reasons why mid-century buildings must be effectively repurposed to meet climate goals while respecting their history. With the imperative to limit global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, reusing and upgrading these buildings provides a critical near-term carbon reduction strategy. This paper presents two case studies involving the reuse of undergraduate residence halls of this era. The first illustrates the substantial total carbon savings from restoration and reuse. The second proposes an analysis-based methodology for designing retrofits that optimize carbon payback of targeted interventions. © 2021 Goody Clancy.

The advancement in the pre-engineered building construction approach involves time limitation, cost-effectiveness, improved structural behaviour and advanced architectural view. Pre-engineered buildings are becoming an effective replacement of conventional steel buildings in every aspect. It shows more advanced results in case of cost comparison, construction time, quality parameters and architectural point of view. The main objective of the current study is to compare pre-engineered steel buildings and conventional steel building in every aspect. A pre-engineered building was designed and then comparative analysis was done concerning a conventional building with the same configuration. The software which was mainly used for the entire designing and analysis part was Bentley STAAD PRO and it was found that the Pre-engineered building gives more sustainable results as compared to conventional steel buildings. It was also found that, if the construction process was according to conventional methods it will be more time consuming and more budget consuming at every aspect, so pre-engineered buildings usage should be implemented as the construction as well as the maintenance cost of pre-engineered buildings is very less as that of conventional steel buildings. One more aspect was taken into consideration, the materials used for the construction of the pre-engineered buildings were pre-fabricated and then assembled in such a way that the materials are both reusable and recyclable for future usage. So concerning this aspect, the whole structural components, as well as the structure, can be moulded and shifted to any of the other locations also and that will fulfil the major aspect of sustainable construction. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

As a part of domain engineering, the scope of the SPrL must be delimited providing the processes and their features to be reused and established, as well as specifying the situations that these processes will support.

HBPr was recently patented by an Italian company Kanésis that focused its activity on nature-derived materials. The filaments are the upshot of an original process allowing to reuse the surplus of the agricultural supply chains and transform it into new sustainable materials. At first, the 3D printed HBPr samples were tested in tensile tests according to the ASTMD638 standard and monitored in term of deformations by the Digital Image Correlation techniques (DIC) in order to evaluate the stress-strain behavior of different HBPr textures under loading. In addition, using the HBPr and the results coming from the experimental campaign, the design of an exhibition pavilion was proposed. The pavilion was modelled starting from the geometric construction of the fullerene. The supporting modular structure is combined by HBPr modular elements, that can be produced by 3D printing or moulding.

Therefore, a composite magnetic coagulant (CMC) containing ferromagnetic nanoparticle and alum was developed by mixing, drying and calcining for the remediation of textile effluent. The physicochemical and structural adsorption properties of the CMC and alum were examined with a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and a Spectrum Two FT-IR Spectrometer. Jar test apparatus was employed to evaluate the coagulation performance for the removal of turbidity, color and some heavy metals (Al, Cu, Fe, Zn, and Mg). Three most effective operational parameters (coagulant dosage, initial pH and magnetic time exposure) were examined by response surface methodology (RSM). SEM results showed well-modified layers of the magnetic nanoparticles with large surface area and pore size. Magnetized residue exhibited great reusability potential with improved functional groups (FT-IR) compared to alum. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests proved that the quadratic models developed were significant with P-values less than 0.05 and regression coefficients close to 1 at a 95% confidence level. Coagulant dosage was the most influential factor. Under optimum conditions of dosage (45 mg/L), pH (4) and magnetic exposure time (50 min), the software denoting 85% and 82% removal of turbidity and color respectively predicted the desirability of 85%. In both organics and heavy metals removal; CMC demonstrated a better performance of 80-95% than alum (40-75%). Therefore, the application of superparamagnetic nanocomposite (CMC) in the water and wastewater settings is foreseen as an eco-friendly and effective coagulant for the remediation of heavy metals and their derivative pollutants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Then, the effect of the main operational parameters, such as sulphate radical precursors (namely, peroxymonosulfate [PMS] and peroxydisulfate [PDS]), pH of aqueous solution, ultrasound (US) frequency and power, CuFe2O4 loading, reaction time, atenolol (ATL) concentration, as well as inorganic anions on the sonocatalytic process in removing ATL from water was investigated. The results revealed that the PMS outperformed the PDS due to its unsymmetrical structure. Under optimal conditions, the initial pH of the aqueous solution, the US frequency and power, the CuFe2O4 loading, the PMS concentration, and the ATL concentration were also obtained by 7.5, 80 kHz, 100 W, 0.4 g/L, 1.2 mM, and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. At the concentration of 10 mg/L of the ATL, its removal and the mineralisation rates were equal to 83.1% and 48.31%, respectively. The inhibitory effect of the inorganic anions on the removal of the ATL correspondingly followed the sequence of HCO3−&gt;H2PO4−&gt;SO42-&gt;NO3−. In the scavenging experiment, methanol showed greater effectiveness compared with other agents in the removal of the ATL, indicating that the SO4•- radicals were the dominant active species within the reaction. The reusability test also demonstrated that the CuFe2O4 efficiency decreased by almost 10% after five consecutive cycles. Besides, the intermediates of the ATL degradation were determined by the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technique and the proposed mechanism for the ATL degradation was expressed.

It is commonly known as an environmentally friendly pile method. It generates no surplus soil nor muddy water during installation by screwing the pile into the ground with its helical plate at pile tip. On the other hand, by rotating reversely, it can be pulled out and retrieved, thus also be recycled and reused if necessary. This article presents the recycling and reusing procedure and criteria of screw steel pile EAZET based on experience. For safe and smooth retrieval, capable machine should be chosen carefully in advance. The capacity of the machine and the torque during retrieval should be constantly noticed, especially when the retrieval is conducted long time after installation. The reason is that the ground disturbed by the pile installation has recovered, where it requires larger torque for pulling out. Retrieved piles will be examined via visual check, dimension check, and bending test of the pile shaft. After that, they will be divided into reusable members and non-reusable members. Reusable members can be repaired for future reuse. On the other hand, non-reusable members are recycled as reproduction materials for components in recycling factory. Recyclable and reusable features of EAZET enable it to be further adopted by temporary structures besides its original market. It can contribute to the transformation from economical society to recycling society where the efficient usage and recycling are emphasized. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Environmental friendly method; Recycle; Reuse; Screw steel pile; Sustainable society","Cell proliferation; Plates (structural components); Recycling; Screws; Muddy waters; Pile installation; Pile shaft; Pulling out; Recycling factories; Reusable member; Steel piles; Temporary structures; Piles",Conference Paper,Scopus

A series of experiment to investigate the impact energy absorbing characteristics of aluminium and brass rods with various cutting depths and impact energy were carried out and cross-checked by a numerical study using explicit dynamics. The behaviour of reaction force at impact was found to be highly reliant on cutting depth. This material removal process was also found to be efficient in dissipating impact energy to provide sufficient structural protection. Acceleration Severity Index was defined to demonstrate the occupant protection with acceptable declarative forces during impact.

This makes the aeroelastic study an extremely important aspect of aircraft design. By having more light weight control surfaces, the control effectiveness study becomes vital in today’s scenario. Control effectiveness is the ability of a control surface such as an aileron or a rudder to produce aerodynamic forces and moments to change the airplane orientation and manoeuvre it along the intended flight path. This paper presents the static aeroelastic analysis of a typical reusable launch vehicle focusing on control effectiveness of elevon. A Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) is the space analogy of an aircraft. Ideally it takes off vertically on the back of a dispensable rocket and then glides back down like an aircraft.

Semiconductors have been at forefront of effective elimination of pollutants from waste water, with the tuning of bandgap and improving the photocatalytic activity. This work elaborates the hydrothermal synthesize of highly stable Nickel Oxide (NiO) and Vanadium-doped Nickel Oxide (V-NiO) nanoparticles. The undoped and doped Nickel Oxide nanoparticles were characterized for structural, morphological, thermal and optical properties. X-ray diffraction pattern reveals the V-NiO stabilized in cubic structure. Morphological analysis demonstrates that upon Vanadium doping NiO particles transform from network like structure to spherical nanoparticles. NiO and V-NiO nanoparticles have an average crystallite size of 42 nm and 26 nm which are well matched with particle size calculated from transmission electron micrographs. The photoluminescence study reveals that the Vanadium substitution specifically reduces the rate of recombination in NiO. The V-NiO catalysts exhibited noticeable red shift of absorption spectrum to the visible region in comparison with pure NiO. The functional groups were studied using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The photocatalytic study by degradation of Xylenol Orange (XyO) under sunlight irradiation unveils that photocatalytic activity of NiO is enhanced on vanadium doping. Reaction kinetics investigation of XyO degradation revealed that the reaction obeys the pseudo-zero-order model with improved rate constant of 0.115 mol L−1S−1 and 0.225 mol L−1S−1 for NiO and V-NiO, respectively. The retention of high performance and structural stability of photocatalysts after four consecutive degradation cycles implies the reusability of the catalyst. Consequently, the V-NiO with high photocatalytic activity with improved cyclic stability is able to provide as a promising material in the field of environmental remediation. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Catalysts; Crystallite size; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Nanoparticles; Nickel oxide; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Photocatalytic activity; Rate constants; Red Shift; Reusability; Semiconductor doping; Stability; Synthesis (chemical); Water pollution; Water treatment; Environmental remediation; High photocatalytic activities; Industrial pollutants; Morphological analysis; Nickel oxide nanoparticle; Spherical nanoparticles; Structural stabilities; Transmission electron micrograph; Vanadium compounds",Article,Scopus

Life cycle assessment (LCA) can facilitate CE decision-making by identifying the largest environmental impact reduction opportunities throughout a building's life cycle, but it does not suffice in a design situation. Thus, aggregated LCA knowledge is needed. However, existing building LCAs lack transparency, coherence and a closer coupling with the building context. Performing in-depth systematic LCA on four Danish case-study buildings (a school, an office, a residential building and a hospital), this study identifies where the largest embodied greenhouse gas emissions (EG) exist. The study also identifies which building design and construction strategies should be in focus in transitioning the building sector to a CE. The LCA generalisations found that all the buildings exhibited considerable EG originating from production and replacement of floors and ceilings, outer walls, inner walls and roofs. Thus, to come closer to meeting climate goals, a combination of different strategies going across and beyond the life cycles of buildings, components and materials is needed. These strategies include reusing existing buildings, components and materials; avoiding, substituting or reducing the use of EG-intensive and short-lived materials; and enabling future reuse, recycling and/or energy recovery options for materials. Differences between the buildings were also found. Thus, it is suggested to combine generalised learnings with LCA of buildings on a case-to-case basis, and to focus on optimising EG-intensive components and materials based on their different use-contexts and interconnectedness rather than on optimising the entire building. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings; Circular economy (CE); Environmental performance; Life cycle assessment (LCA)","Construction industry; Decision making; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Walls (structural partitions); Building design; Building industry; Building sectors; Circular economy; Design situations; Energy recovery; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Residential building; Architectural design",Article,Scopus

SO4−• and ·OH which were explored by and scavenging tests were the major reactive radicals in the Mn3O4/PMS system. A simple simulation algorithm was also used to calculate the relative concentrations of SO4−• ([SO4−•]) and ·OH ([·OH]) which were 8.39 × 10 −15 M and 6.96 × 10 −13 M, respectively. The mechanism for the electron transfer between the Mn (II) and Mn (III) species was discussed. Three degradation pathways of BPAF were determined by the GC/MS and LC/MS technology, including chemical mechanism of oxidation, hydroxylation, electron transfer, polymerization, and ring-cleavage. In addition, the results suggested that the Mn3O4/PMS system had an efficient total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate and excellent environmental adaptability, the removal rate of TOC being as high as 73.2% in the control condition. Furthermore, the reuse experiments and the comparison on the structural and componential changes of Mn3O4 powder before and after reaction demonstrated that the Mn3O4 catalyst possessed excellent stability and reusability. Finally, a maximum BPAF degradation of approximately 90.0% was achieved on the optimal conditions for 500 mg/L Mn3O4 dosage, 4 mM PMS concentration, 7.0 ± 0.2 initial pH, and 5 mg/L BPAF concentration respectively.

Among these, zirconium-based nanomaterial was regarded as an effective kind because of its ability to bind phosphate specifically via inner-sphere complexation. In this study, we proposed a new strategy to improve the efficiency of zirconium oxides (HZO) nanoparticles by immobilizing them onto a gel-type anion exchange resin covalently attached with ammonium groups, denoted as HZO@N201. A previously developed macro-porous polymeric nanocomposite HZO@D201 was used for comparison. The immobilized nanoparticles in HZO@N201 were well dispersed in the gel matrix, manifesting smaller particle size and richer surface hydroxyl groups in comparison to HZO@D201. As a result of the structural merits in collective, HZO@N201 not only exhibited superior phosphate adsorptive capacity and affinity towards phosphate to HZO@D201, but also facilitate phosphate diffusion, based on isotherm, pH and kinetic tests. Mechanistic study by XPS and 31P SS-NMR substantiated the selective phosphate adsorption pathway as the formation of inner-sphere complexes by HZO@N201, which exhibited enhanced reactivity than HZO@D201. Lastly, fixed-bed runs of HZO@N201 was conducted, achieving an effective treatable volume of 2000 BV, which was 600 BV more than HZO@D201. Additional adsorption-regeneration cycle confirmed its reusability and potential for practical application. We believe the gel-type polymeric host could facilitate the formation and dispersion of smaller sized nanoparticles, exposing more surface hydroxyl groups highly accessible to phosphate.

The reuse of dredged sediments as road materials is an interesting solution to environmental problems. However, only the compaction technique without treatment by admixtures is insufficient to improve the strength and stiffness of the dredged sediments for use as standard road materials. This research presents the mechanical and microstructural properties of dredged sediments treated with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and fly ash (FA). A large amount of FA was utilised for the purpose of cost-effectiveness. The dredged sediments were mixed with 1.5%–5% OPC and 5%–20% using exclusively OPC, exclusively FA and a combination of OPC and FA. The experiments in this study consisted of unconfined compressive strength, splitting tensile strength, California bearing ratio, resilient modulus, and ultrasonic pulse velocity tests. The results showed that the mechanical properties were improved by the addition of FA and that the maximum values of these properties were observed with a combination of 5% OPC and 10% FA. In addition to evaluating the mechanical properties, microscale analyses were also conducted using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to understand the behaviour of the dredged sediment with respect to the OPC and FA contents.

The factors like manufacturing, reusability, recyclability, disposal etc, are the criteria of utmost attention affecting the overall life cycle impact of the construction materials. In this prospect the Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) has shown up as an exceptionally viable contender for the manufacturing of concrete with several environmental benefits over the Natural Aggregate (NA) and has already been identified by industry and several government agencies across the globe. The efficient material use of RCA can potentially deliver an inferior though competent concrete in comparison to the NA while averring the criteria of sustenance. The present study delves into the calculation of the proportion of the RCA in a mix design for achieving maximum compressive strength. The experimental setup constituted the casting of concrete cubes of control mix design of M40 grade with proportions of RCA varying from 0-100 percent spread over a space of 10% with NA which were later put to tests. The thorough investigation on the casted concrete cubes lead to the conclusion that the mix design with 50% proportion of RCA in addition to 50% proportion of NA delivered the maximum compressive strength, an average value of 8.23% higher than that of the normal concrete and the highest Rebound Number, an average value of 53.92 for the M40 grade concrete thereby showcasing the feasibility of producing structural concrete with RCA. The results are asserted to be governed by the better bonding between the RCA and NA and due to the significant increase in the water retention capacity by the provision of RCA in the mix. © 2020 EDP Sciences.

The structural and morphological properties of this modified clay are investigated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope. NC and modified clay at 600 °C (MC600) were applied for hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), removal from aqueous media via batch adsorption facility. According to the experimental results, the adsorption capacity for chromium removal was calculated (14.3 mg g−1) with a removal efficiency reached to 66% after 90 min of equilibrium time. The sorption matrix indicated that Cr(VI) removal is following the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The experimental data are well fitted with Freundlich isotherm model and the adsorption process is suggested to follow a chemisorption and favourable uptake. The clay reusability was also tested and the outcomes suggested that MC600 had good potential as an economic adsorbent for chromium removal from contaminated water.

The uranyl unit generally exhibits relatively high UV absorption efficiency and strong fluorescence intensity. Hence in this work, a uranyl coordination polymer compound [(TEA)2(UO2)5(PhPC)6] (TEA=tetraethylammonium ion, PhPC = (2-carboxyethyl)phenylphosphinic acid, denoted as UPhPC-1) was successfully synthesized via the hydrothermal method. The structural analysis of UPhPC-1 based on the single crystal XRD data elucidates that there are three crystallographically unique uranyl centers. Two uranyl units are in the pentagonal bipyramidal geometry, while the third one is in the tetragonal bipyramidal geometry. All three uranyl units are connected by the ligands to form infinite uranyl layers in the [bc] plane, which are packed via hydrogen bonding networks and π-π interactions to yield the overall layered structure. The stability test results of UPhPC-1 demonstrate that the compound exhibits good thermal and hydrolytic stability with high radiation resistance. Moreover, results of the UV irradiation experiments show that the intrinsic luminescence of UPhPC-1 is highly sensitive to 365 nm UV irradiation with a low detection limit and a fast response rate. A negative correlation between the emission intensity and the UV irradiation dosage was then established. The electron paramagnetic resonance data analysis strongly supports the production of radicals in UPhPC-1 under UV radiation, which leads to the partial quenching of the uranyl fluorescence. Furthermore, the radicals in the quenched sample can be readily eliminated by heating, resulting in the recovery of the photoluminescence inten-sity of UPhPC-1. The current results suggest suitable application potential of UPhPC-1 in the field of quantitative UV detection. © 2020, Science Press.

PVC was recovered from copper electrical cables, ground and used as replacement of mineral aggregate in 5, 10, 15 and 20 % vol. in mortar. A thermal characterization of the starting material was carried out to understand its composition. The mortar samples were mechanically tested both using class G cement and ordinary Portland cement. The results showed a worsening of the mechanical properties of around 50 % for only 5 % in volume of sand substituted with PVC waste. A likely explanation to this phenomenon was found in the mechanical characteristics of the PVC used and to its poor adhesion with the matrix, that resulted in the creation of porosity.

Recycling solves the problem of their storage and adverse environmental impact. Six different formulas of epoxy resins were tested, differing in the type of polymer, the mixing process (sonication or not) and the presence of microsilica. The study showed that microsilica added to the epoxy resin changes its viscosity and free surface energy, and these are the parameters that determine the adhesion of the polymer to the concrete surface. Strength tests and SEM analysis have determined how microsilica molecules can penetrate the structure of polymer macromolecules by filling and forming temporary chemical bonds. Mixing the fillers with the adhesive was achieved by using a sonication process. The analysis of the obtained results showed that, depending on the initial composition of the polymer, the addition of microsilica can change the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the hardened adhesive to varying degrees. In the case of adhesives used in the construction industry to strengthen and glue structural elements, these changes significantly affect the durability of the adhesive joints. © 2020 by the authors.

A TSTO concept aircraft comprising a booster and a cruiser was proposed in this paper. The typical trapezoidal wing configuration was used as the booster and the wing spherical cone was used as the cruiser. Based on the three-dimensional hybrid LES/RANS numerical simulation method, the aerodynamic interference characteristics of different nose configurations in the cruise stage were studied, the pressure and heat flux distributions on the upper and lower surfaces of the cruise stage and the booster stage were calculated and analysed, the characteristics and mechanism of the aerodynamic interference between the two stages were revealed, and the structural changes of the flow field and the characteristics of the aerodynamic interference under different head configurations of the cruise stage were compared. The results show that the shock/shock interaction outside the blunt nose of the cruiser causes serious aerodynamic and thermal problems on the stagnation point. There are complex shock wave/boundary layer interactions and reflected shock trains between the two stages, which results in high-level pressure and heat flux on the surfaces. An alteration of the nose configuration can greatly improve the wall pressure and heat flux on the surface. The Bend cone model provides the greatest reduction in peak pressure and heat flux and is a suitable choice for an RLV cruiser. © 2020 IAA","Aero-heating; Computational fluid dynamics; Hypersonic; Reusable spacecraft; Shock wave interaction","Aerospace vehicles; Boosters (rocket); Heat flux; Hypersonic vehicles; Launch vehicles; Numerical methods; Reusability; Reusable rockets; Shock waves; Wings; Aerodynamic interactions; Aerodynamic interference; Characteristics and mechanisms; Heat flux distributions; Numerical simulation method; Reusable launch vehicles; Shock-wave/boundary layer interactions; Wing configurations; Aerodynamic configurations",Article,Scopus

The structure, morphology and optical property of materials were characterized using various instruments. The results proved that Ag-doped SnS2@InVO4 composite presented as hexangular nanosheets with about 4.87 nm pore size and 101.58 m2/g specific surface area. Further characterization demonstrated that photo-adsorption ability of visible light was enhanced and band gap was narrowed. The adsorption kinetics and isotherm of U(VI) on Ag-doped SnS2@InVO4 composite could be depicted via the Langmuir model and pseudo-second-order mode, and the maximum adsorption capacity of U(VI) reached 167.79 mg/g. The elimination of U(VI) of as-synthesized composites was studied by a synergy of adsorption and visible-light photocatalysis, and the optimal content of InVO4 was found to be 2 wt% with the highest removal efficiency of 97.6%. In addition, compared with pure SnS2 and Ag-doped SnS2, the Ag-doped SnS2@InVO4 composites exhibited superior photocatalytic performance for the conversion of soluble U(VI) to insoluble U(IV) under visible light. The excellent photocatalytic performance was mainly attributed to numerous surface-active sites, strong optical adsorption ability and narrow band gap. Simultaneously, the heterojunction between Ag-doped SnS2 and InVO4 promoted the separation and transfer of photoexcited charges. The cyclic experiments indicated the Ag-doped SnS2@InVO4 composite remained good structural stability and reusability.

For commonly used reduced graphene oxide (rGO), oxygen-containing functional groups can provide coupling sites to conjugate with bio-cognitive elements, but high degree of oxidation can harm its structural integrity and signal conductivity. In this work, a new strategy is developed to balance the conductivity and functionality of rGO. The PTCA-rGO composite film was prepared by self-assembly and used to fabricate electrochemical biosensor. To form reusable thrombin aptasensor, an in situ layer-by-layer self-assembling method was adopted to stepwise deposit reduced graphene oxide (rGO), 3, 4, 9, 10-perylenetetracarboxylic acid (PTCA), and thrombin aptamer (TBA) onto 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane (APTES)-modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). The as-prepared aptasensor was used to determine thrombin in response to impedimetric signal by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The as-prepared GCE/rGO/PTCA/TBA sensor provided outstanding performance for determination of thrombin concentration with wide linear range (1 pM-100 nM), low detection limit (0.2 pM), reusability, and good specificity to thrombin. The good performance of GCE/rGO/PTCA/TBA aptasensor can be attributed to the electrochemical property of rGO-PTCA composite film and the in situ layer-by-layer fabricated strategy.

Herein, we report the application of a commercially available 3D-printer for the rapid development of a reusable alumina monolith as a support in a heterogeneous system. Palladium nanoparticles (PdNps) were successfully immobilized on the prepared monolith using the deposition-precipitation method. The properties of the palladium incorporated monolith (Pd-MOT) were assessed via detailed characterization techniques. To quantitatively benchmark the performance of the prepared monolith catalyst (Pd-MOT), a powdered equivalent was prepared by crushing a fraction of Pd-MOT, which is denoted as Pd/Al2O3. Both catalysts were employed in the Mizoroki-Heck, Suzuki-Miyaura and copper-free Sonogashira-Hagihara cross-coupling reactions. The results show that Pd-MOT demonstrated enhanced catalytic activity compared to the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst in all the reactions investigated. The enhanced performance of Pd/MOT is attributed to its structural design. This helps to promote the compartmentalization of PdNps within the monolith structure, thus minimizing leaching, agglomeration, and catalyst loss.

Australian state governments are developing policies to enable a circular economy. However, in the building industry most data systems rely on self-reporting, which has compromised the accuracy, objectivity, transparency and integrity of data reported on raw materials within components and products. Method - This paper uses a case study to demonstrate how digital data systems that independently track, trace and verify the provenance of inputs of raw materials, components and products, can accurately inform the value of circularity in the built environment. Interviews were conducted with an office furniture supplier who developed a digital system to inform circularity. Also interviewed was a sustainability consultant who assisted, and has since prototyped a digital system designed to accurately enable circular value to be identified in the built environment. Feedback on the design and protype of this proposed system was provided by building industry value-chain stakeholders though a series of seminars and design thinking workshops. Results - Commercial viability of a circular economy model was reliant on a framework of data quality that recorded raw materials, traceability and verification to establish trust: 1) data capturing raw materials within components of products (e.g. metals, melamine and plastics), 2) data tracking of products throughout their life-cycle, and 3) data verifying the authenticity of raw materials and products. This framework of data quality was critical to delivering circularity outcomes for reuse of products, repurposing components, recycling and minimising landfill. Conclusion - This study proposes that data quality is integral to the commercial viability of circular economy business models in the built environment. Data quality in a circular economy means having the digital capability to objectively track, trace and verify the integrity and composition of building materials, products and assemblies throughout their lifecycle. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The optimum immobilization conditions were determined by single-factor experiments and response surface methods: sodium alginate (SA) concentration was 1 wt%, the CaCl2 concentration was 2 wt%, the cross-linking time was 10 min, and the reaction temperature was 52℃. As a biocompatible adhesive, calcium alginate (CA) can be easily printed. The structural programmability of 3D printing technology endowed the immobilized xylanase with sphere, hook, quadrangle and hexagon shapes. The immobilized xylanase exhibited the excellent reusability with recovered 60% enzyme activity after 7 times using compared with free xylanase. Moreover, the ability of 3D printed xylanase to degrade lignocellulose of corn cob at the large-scale indicated the great potential in the application of industrial production, which can provide a certain reference for the biological intelligent manufacturing of high value-added chemicals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","3D printing; Biocompatible polymer; Degradation; Lignocellulose; Xylanase","Adhesives; Biocompatibility; Catalysts; Cellulose; Chlorine compounds; Costs; Crosslinking; Enzyme activity; Industrial chemicals; Lignin; Reusability; Sodium alginate; Biocompatible polymer; Immobilization conditions; Intelligent Manufacturing; Lignocellulose degradation; Response surface method; Single-factor experiments; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; Value-added chemicals; 3D printers",Article,Scopus

All the films are polycrystalline CoCo2O4, for simplicity Co3O4, spinel (AB2O4) cubic phase. The doping levels of Sn and La/Sn have strongly affected the surface morphologies and roughness parameters.

The few studies addressing the matter focus on the estimation of GDP growth and job creation potential of certain ""circular activities” (CA). These CA are assumed to be labour-intensive, so job losses resulting from the paradigm shift should be offset by the overall gains. However, significant structural differences in the economic characteristics of these activities suggest that their development may have dissimilar socio-economic implications, while their promotion would require diverse policy instruments. This paper aims to study the current sectoral structure, main economic features and recent evolution of the CA in the European Union. The focus is on the 24 activities that, according to the NACE Rev. 2, compose the repair, reuse and recycling sectors, as a limited yet representative subset of all the CA currently bound and constrained within the predominant linear economy. Results show that significant differences in labour intensity exist between repair and reuse, on the one hand, and recycling, on the other. Besides, employment concentrates in low-wage labour-intensive CA, suggesting that more attention should be paid to improving competitiveness and working conditions in activities such as repair and reuse which are by definition both ecological and inclusive. Also, the structural heterogeneity of the activities under analysis imply the need for targeted policy instruments tailored to the specificities of each of the various CE sub-sectors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Capital intensity; Circular economy; Labour intensity; Labour productivity; Sectoral structure; Targeted policy","Employment; Recycling; Economic characteristics; Labour intensity; Organizational aspects; Policy instruments; Reuse and recycling; Structural condition; Structural differences; Structural heterogeneity; Repair; employment; European Union; Gross Domestic Product; recycling; structural change; wage determination; wage gap; working conditions; article; attention; employment; European Union; productivity; recycling; structure analysis; work environment; Europe",Article,Scopus

These problems are characteristic of linear value chains. In contrast, a circular economy approach to building construction has the potential to moderate these three problems. One way this can be achieved is to enable in-use building stocks as a repository of products for future reuse, sometimes referred to as urban mining. A key stage in such a shift is to be able to quantify stocks of construction materials and assess their direct reuse potential as products against criteria such as their location, age, type, and embodied carbon. The majority of studies of building stocks have focused on producing aggregated quantities of materials, regardless of the required information for assessing the potential value streams of future reuse. In this paper, a framework for spatiotemporal mapping of building structural products integrating external geometries and construction history is presented.

As a result, efficient porous materials for the capture and safe storage of radioactive iodine are required. In this work, nanoscale zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and its amino-functionalized ZIF-8 derivatives with 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Atz), denoted as ZIF8-A, were prepared via postsynthetic modification, and their performance for I2 removal from n-hexane was investigated. The abundant amine functionalities in the ZIF8-A structure including the primary and secondary amine groups (−NH2 and −NH) and triazole-ring (−C-N−NH−) not only serve as effective adsorption sites but also form strong interactions with I2 via electron transfer from the nitrogen atom of the ligand to I2. The adsorption isotherms and the kinetics were well fitted by the Langmuir model and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, respectively, suggesting a monolayer chemisorption process. ZIF8-A61 achieved an adsorption capacity of more than 870% compared to the pristine ZIF-8. Based on the experimental and computational results, a plausible mechanism for the adsorption of I2 on ZIF8-A nanocrystals is proposed by considering the host−guest interactions, specifically, those between the amine functional groups and I2.

Efficient means of working with 3D macromolecular structural data for archiving, analyses, and visualization are central to facilitating interoperability and reusability in compliance with the FAIR Principles. We address two challenges posed by growth in data size and complexity. First, data size is reduced by bespoke compression techniques. Second, complexity is managed through improved software tooling and fully leveraging available data dictionary schemas. To this end, we introduce BinaryCIF, a serialization of Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format files that maintains full compatibility to related data schemas, such as PDBx/mmCIF, while reducing file sizes by more than a factor of two versus gzip compressed CIF files. Moreover, for the largest structures, BinaryCIF provides even better compression—factor ten and four versus CIF files and gzipped CIF files, respectively. Herein, we describe CIFTools, a set of libraries in Java and TypeScript for generic and typed handling of CIF and BinaryCIF files. Together, BinaryCIF and CIFTools enable lightweight, efficient, and extensible handling of 3D macromolecular structural data. © 2020 Sehnal et al.

To this end, the Azalea A platform, located in the northern Adriatic Sea, is considered a good pilot site. This study analyzes the engineering solutions on Azalea A for the combined production of solar and wind energy coupled with hydrogen production from seawater electrolysis. It analyzes the potential for storage and transport on land of the produced hydrogen using the sealines connected to the platform. However, this study does not deal with the current structural conditions of the platform (corrosion, stability etc.), which should be evaluated before these solutions are put into practice. The main outcomes of this work consist in a feasibility study for the reuse of existing infrastructures as a self-sufficient research hub using green energy systems, which include considerations about the measures needed to ensure the protection of the marine environment. Data show a positive feedback about the technical feasibility of the proposal in safety conditions. Furthermore, encouraging outcomes derive also by the economic evaluation that estimates sustainable costs comparing to those implicated with the decommissioning of the infrastructures in the order of tens millions euro.

The combination of mechanochromic materials with polymers offers a practical approach to designing and fabricating these sensors. Polymers as matrices can tolerate a wide range of forces and permits reusability of the sensors. On the other hand, mechanochromic materials provide unique colour properties depending on the type of mechanical action. They have also been frequently employed for the quantification of mechanical forces. As an example, non-centrosymmetric crystals are combined with polymers for sensing impact forces.

The time required for degrading 50 % of acid orange 7 solution by the activated FeSiBNbCu amorphous ribbons is only 1/6 of that by the as-quenched ribbons, while the reusable times of the activated ribbons is 6 times larger than that of the as-quenched ribbons. The superior degradation capability and better reusability of the activated FeSiBNbCu amorphous ribbons come from not only the uneven topography of the ribbon surface induced by ball milling, but also the stored deformation energy, including the structural rejuvenation and the enlarged residual stress. The structural rejuvenation in the activated FeSiBNbCu amorphous ribbons is verified by heat relaxation analysis, and the increased residual stress is confirmed by the magnetic domain measurements on the ribbon surfaces. Besides, the environmental adaptability of the activated FeSiBNbCu amorphous ribbons is also investigated.

However, excluding geometrical and material nonlinearities from the numerical substructure might make a significant difference in internal force redistribution and reduce the simulation accuracy beyond acceptable levels. Also, materials at a high temperature very often exhibit time-dependent behavior, including strain-rate dependency, high-temperature creep, and stress relaxation, which prohibit the use of extended testing time scales. This standpoint motivated the development of the real-time hybrid fire simulation method presented in this paper. Dynamic relaxation is proposed to solve the static response of the hybrid numerical-experimental fire simulation. As an equivalent dynamic solution method, dynamic relaxation allows for coupling substructure equations of motion by using a partitioned time integration approach. Minimal data exchange between substructures and negligible computational overhead plus ease of reusability of verified finite-element software makes the proposed algorithm suitable for coordinating real-time hybrid fire simulations.

This paper presents the green engineering of a new bio-sponge for heavy metals adsorption composed of alginate bio-polymeric network encapsulated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) modified with iron oxide nanoparticles and covalently attached multithiol (pentaerythritol tetrakis-mercaptopropionate) molecules using photoinitiated thiol-ene click chemistry.

It was shown that the level of thiol functionalization on the graphene structure within the bio-sponge can be controlled by tuning the Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation time without adjusting the concentration of the precursors.

As a new structural steel, the post-fire mechanical properties, regarded as a crucial indicator to assess structural damage and reusability after fire, need to be studied. Hence, a comprehensive experimental investigation on the influence of two artificial cooling methods on post-fire mechanical properties of Q355 steel is reported in this study. The specimens were first heated to target temperatures of 200 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C to simulate various fire conditions and then cooled by fire-extinguishing foam cooling and water cooling. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed on these fire-affected specimens to extract the stress–strain curves and associated post-fire mechanical properties. Additionally, fracture behavior of Q355 steel cooled by the two artificial cooling methods was also discussed from macroscopic and microscopic fracture morphology. For the two artificial cooling methods, it is explicitly found that the loss of mechanical properties of Q355 steel is negligible after exposure to temperatures below 600 °C. However, both cooling methods and elevated temperatures have significant effects on post-fire mechanical properties of Q355 steel after the exposure temperature exceeds 600 °C. In case of fire-extinguishing foam cooling, a dramatic decrease in yield strength and ultimate strength is observed, while the ductility is gradually increased with increasing temperature. In contrast, a sharp increase in yield strength and ultimate strength can be observed clearly, while the ductility is sharply reduced with increasing temperature. After exposure to the temperature of 900 °C, Q355 steel cooled by fire-extinguishing foam is able to retain 79% of its original ultimate strength, while Q355 steel cooled by water is able to gain 131% of its original ultimate strength in the as-received state. At last, new equations are developed to predict post-fire mechanical properties of Q355 steel for fire damage evaluation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial cooling methods; Macroscopic fracture characteristics; Micro-fracture mechanism; Post-fire mechanical properties; Proposed equations; Q355 structural steel","Building materials; Cooling; Ductility; Fire extinguishers; Fracture mechanics; Reusability; Steel construction; Strain; Temperature; Tensile testing; Yield stress; Chinese national standard; Elevated temperature; Experimental investigations; Exposure temperature; Fracture morphology; Increasing temperatures; Macroscopic and microscopic; Uniaxial tensile test; Fires",Article,Scopus

The characterization results showed that the obtained PR-Cell-MIP displayed 2-D petal-like laminar sheet and owned ample functional groups such as N = N, COCl and –COOH. The photo-responsive tests confirmed the excellent photo-isomerization property of PR-Cell-MIP, leading to a satisfactory regeneration during the 2,4-D adsorption. Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that the 2,4-D adsorption followed Frendlich adsorption isotherm. Meanwhile, the higher equilibrium template bindings (89.03%), lower specific binding constant KD (11.601 mg L−1) and apparent maximum number Qmax (11.039 mg g−1) suggested much higher adsorption performance of PR-Cell-MIP than that of the non-imprinted polymer (PR-Cell-NIP). The selectivity experiments revealed that PR-Cell-MIP presented better specificity towards 2,4-D than its structural analogues. In addition, the PR-Cell-MIP also displayed outstanding stability, reusability (8 cycles) and green regeneration.

All the necessary structural analyses such as SEM, EDX, FT-IR, TGA, XRD, BET and VSM have been done. This porous heterogeneous catalyst indicates good long-term stability in the air, and also protection of the copper nanoparticles from oxidation. Other advantages of this catalyst are easy separation of the catalyst, milder and green reaction conditions, high yields and short reaction time (∼10 min). Additionally, copper nanoparticles and poly(vinyl alcohol) synergistically act against E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and the Fe3O4/silicalite-1/PVA/Cu(i) nanocomposite showed higher antimicrobial activity for E. coli. The antimicrobial activity was determined by using a colony-reduction method. Insertion of amine groups onto the surface of Fe3O4/silicalite-1 has no effect on the antibacterial performance. Moreover, the reusability of Fe3O4/silicalite-1/PVA/Cu(i) is proved. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.",,"Copper; Escherichia coli; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocomposites; Polyvinyl alcohols; Reusability; Silicate minerals; Sol-gel process; 1 ,3-Dipolarcycloaddition; Anti-bacterial activity; Anti-bacterial performance; Anti-microbial activity; Catalytic performance; Copper nanoparticles; Heterogeneous catalyst; Three component reactions; Catalyst activity; 1,4 disubstituted 1,2,3 triazole derivative; antiinfective agent; copper ion; magnetite; nanocomposite; polyvinyl acetate; silicate; triazole derivative; unclassified drug; antibacterial activity; Article; catalysis; cycloaddition; drug design; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Escherichia coli; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; priority journal; reaction time; scanning electron microscopy; Staphylococcus aureus; thermogravimetry; X ray diffraction",Article,Scopus

Herein, the disinfection potential of nano-silver loaded chitosan-PVA hydrogel to completely eradicate biomedical contaminants coexisting with natural contaminants in environmental samples was successfully demonstrated for the first time. The polymeric network of the hydrogel served a dual role for in situ synthesis and immobilization of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) simultaneously. Porous Ag-loaded hydrogels displayed a temperature-dependent swelling behavior and exhibited an improved mechanical strength (Young's modulus, 12.36 ± 0.29 MPa; elongation at break, 180%) by effectively distributing the external stress and restored its structural integrity. Complete disinfection (100% killing) could be achieved within 4 h against all the four tested contaminants, demonstrating a distinct strain-specific biocidal activity. Being a diffusion-controlled process, the oxidative dissolution of AgNPs deeply buried in the interiors of the hydrogel architectures was adversely affected on repeated use and restricted the maximum silver release to 38.8 ± 5.6 μg g-1 hydrogel in an aqueous suspension over 7 days. Correlating the reusability and silver release kinetics, a predominant contact-active role of the hydrogel was envisaged via 'capture and kill' over leaching of silver ions for rapid water disinfection. The Ag-loaded hydrogels also severely inhibited the biofilm formation of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus till 48 h. Finally, the hydrogels could completely disinfect the natural water samples, i.e., river, ground, and tap water with inherited microbiota and biomedical contaminants in 2 h under the real conditions. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Biohazards; Contamination; Disinfection; Elastic moduli; Escherichia coli; Hydrogels; Metal ions; Reusability; Silver nanoparticles; Suspensions (fluids); Swelling; Synthesis (chemical); Waste disposal; Diffusion-controlled process; Environmental sample; Natural contaminants; Natural water resources; Natural water samples; Oxidative dissolution; Silver nanoparticles (AgNps); Temperature dependent; Water resources; chitin; disinfection; gel; hierarchical system; nanomaterial; nanotechnology; polymer; silver; Escherichia coli; Staphylococcus aureus",Article,Scopus

In this paper, without traditional electro-explosive devices or motors/controllers, the deployable SMPC flexible solar array system (SMPC-FSAS) is studied, developed, ground-based tested, and finally on-orbit validated. The epoxy-based SMPC is used for the rolling-out variable-stiffness beams as a structural frame as well as an actuator for the flexible blanket solar array. The releasing mechanism is primarily made of the cyanate-based SMPC, which has a high locking stiffness to withstand 50 g gravitational acceleration and a large unlocking displacement of 10 mm. The systematical mechanical and thermal qualification tests of the SMPC-FSAS flight hardware were performed, including sinusoidal sweeping vibration, shocking, acceleration, thermal equilibrium, thermal vacuum cycling, and thermal cycling test. The locking function of the SMPC releasing mechanisms was in normal when launching aboard the SJ20 Geostationary Satellite on 27 Dec., 2019. The SMPC-FSAS flight hardware successfully unlocked and deployed on 5 Jan., 2020 on geostationary orbit.

Diminishing the use of such costly functionalized vanadium catalysts is currently one of the considerable topics in materials synthesizing. Herein, a new green method to prepare the V2O5-immobilized perlite nanocomposite (perlite/V2O5 NC) with sphere-shaped morphology in ethylene glycol under thermal conditions was described. Greenness of these processes was completely instituted, as perlite was used both as an ecofriendly and inexpensive material as well as an excellent surface for the growth of the nano-sphere of V2O5, due to electrostatic interactions between vanadium ions and the activated functional groups of alumina and silanol. Then, the application of desired product in the aerobic oxidation reactions of benzyl alcohol derivatives is precisely investigated. Under the optimized reaction conditions (1 mmol of H2O2, 0.02 of perlite/V2O5 NC, and 2.0 mL of acetonitrile) at 82 °C for 5 min, a major range of primary benzylic alcohols and their derivatives were efficiently converted to aldehydes with good yields (90%). All the structural analyses have carried out by using of X-ray diffraction powder (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) with scanning electron microscopy for elemental mapping (SEM-EDS) images, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis and X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) and the obtained results have been carefully interpreted.

One promising approach to this end is the immobilization of enzymes on novel nanomaterials. In this study, a novel nanocarrier was developed for the immobilization of enzyme on polycaprolactone (PCL)-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles. RESULT: Structural and physicochemical characterization of the PCL-modified magnetic nanocarrier was achieved via Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and vibration sample magnetometry (VSM). In order to determine the optimal conditions for immobilization, different parameters such as pH, temperature, reaction time and enzyme concentration were evaluated. Based on the results, the optimal biocatalytic activity of immobilized α-amylase was obtained at 65 °C and pH 6.5. Under appropriate conditions, the immobilized α-amylase showed improved storage stability in comparison with free one. Additionally, the reusability of the immobilized system demonstrated >50% enzyme activity, at optimal pH and temperature, after five reaction cycles.

The ester moiety on the back of the ligand was utilized for immobilization on nanoparticles of Fe3O4. Both ligand and CuL complex were fully characterized by using alternative spectral techniques (nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, ultraviolet-visible and mass spectroscopy, and elemental analyses). Different analytical techniques were used to identify the structural feature and morphology of the immobilized copper catalyst (CuL@TiO2@Fe3O4) shell-shell-core system. The structural analysis revealed that the catalyst system is composed of both agglomerated nanospheres and deformed nanorods. Both copper catalysts, immobilized CuL@TiO2@Fe3O4 and un-immobilized CuL were studied in heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, respectively, for Suzuki-Miyaura (C–C) and Buchwald-Hartwig (C–N) cross-coupling reactions of various heteroaryl halides. Both catalysts showed good catalytic potential under the controlled optimal reaction conditions. In contrast to the homogeneous catalyst (CuL), the heterogeneous catalyst (CuL@TiO2@Fe3O4) showed slightly better catalytic performance. The characteristic obtains supported the catalytic potential of the current samples. Reusability/recycling of both catalysts was also investigated in C–C cross-coupling reactions. It was found that the homogeneous catalyst (CuL) could be only recycled up to three times, whereas the heterogeneous one (CuL@TiO2@Fe3O4) could be reused up to seven times with good efficiency. © 2020 The American Ceramic Society","catalysts/catalysis; characterization; nanoparticles; oxidation","Iron oxides; Ligands; Magnetite; Mass spectrometry; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Nanorods; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; organic-inorganic materials; Oxidation; Reusability; Synthesis (chemical); TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Catalysts/catalysis; Catalytic performance; Cross coupling reactions; Heterogeneous catalyst; Homogeneous catalysis; Hybrid organic-inorganic; Immobilized copper catalysts; Optimal reaction condition; Copper compounds",Article,Scopus

The fabulous character of Pd/N-Cs@SnO2 nanoreactor is attributed to (I) the mesostructured SnO2 shell provides a large surface area for the collection of light as well as the anchoring of Pd to avoid aggregating or leaching; (II) the interlayer void space improves the light absorption by multiple scattering, as well as favors the contact of active sites with reactants in the photocatalytic reactions; (III) the N-Cs allow more permeable visible-light absorption, and accelerate the photoexcited electrons transportation from SnO2 semiconductor to Pd NPs to suppress the electron-hole recombination. This enriches the electron density of Pd NPs surface and then facilitates the photocatalytic reduction of 4-NP.

The main objective of this study is to maximize the utilization and accessibility of cobalt sites while enhancing their activity and stability through rational structural and composition designs, and thus to achieve an excellent performance for heterogeneous peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. To this end, a novel CoTiO3/TiO2 composite (CTT), composed of CoTiO3 overlayer on nanosheets-assembled hierarchical TiO2 nanospheres, was elaborately designed and synthesized. The resulting CTT possessed certain features including CoTiO3-rich surface, large surface area (114.8 m2 g−1), and highly open porous channels, which afforded sufficient accessible active sites against undesirable particle agglomeration and shedding. Moreover, cobalt sites of CTT exhibited a higher activity toward PMS than those of Co3O4 due to the composition-induced distinct adsorption nature, easy electron transfer, and strong bond-weakening ability. Benefitting from the unique combination of structural and compositional advantages, CTT manifested remarkable catalytic efficiency, low cobalt leaching (0.078 mg L−1), and excellent reusability in activation of PMS for degradation of the emerging antibiotic pollutant metronidazole (MNZ). The potential degradation pathway for MNZ and the catalytic mechanism were further elucidated. The design strategy proposed in this study may provide a new opportunity for future development of high-performance heterogeneous cobalt-based catalysts in remediation of aquatic environment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Catalytic degradation; CoTiO3-rich surface; Heterogeneous cobalt-based catalyst; Metronidazole; Nanosheets-assembled hierarchical structure; Peroxymonosulfate activation","Chemical activation; Cobalt; Nanosheets; Nanospheres; Reusability; Titanium dioxide; Catalytic degradation; Cobalt-based catalysts; Hierarchical structures; Metronidazole; Peroxymonosulfate activations; Catalysts",Article,Scopus

If these members are accepted for reuse with minor or no repairs, then the performance of steel members with a high-temperature fire exposure under a future earthquake event should be known. This study investigated the cyclic response of fire exposed steel Welded Unreinforced Flange Web (WUF-W) and Reduced Beam Section (RBS) welded connections. The results showed that fire exposed steel connections are vulnerable to earthquake loading if they are reused with minor or no repairs.

In this work, we propose the employment of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) to prepare conductive hydrogels by partially replacing the PSS dopant by alginate (Alg) chains, which is energetically favoured. The capacity of Alg chains to be electrostatically cross-linked by Ca2+ ions has allowed us to obtain hydrogels with good electrical percolation response and mechanical properties. Hydrogels were prepared in a very simple one-step process by adding CaCl2 to different mixtures of PEDOT PSS and alginic acid (13, 11 and 31). After structural, chemical and physical characterization, the 13 PEDOT/Alg hydrogel was moulded to fabricate stretchable touch-pressure sensor arrays, which exhibited fast response and good spatial resolution of the pressure distribution. In addition, the PEDOT/Alg hydrogel is self-healable which allowed us to prepare reusable pressure sensors (i.e. devices that can be reprocessed to be used in their original application) thanks to the reversibility of the noncovalent Ca2+ crosslinks. Reusable devices are different to reclaimed and recycled devices as these are no longer used for the same application because the materials lose their properties. With our hydrogels we are a step closer to a circular economy by allowing the reuse of electronic devices and reducing electronic waste worldwide. Moreover, the superior performance of the PEDOT/Alg hydrogel opens up its utilization as an efficient and flexible pressure sensor for wearable human-electronic interfaces, in which reusability would be an added value. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chlorine compounds; Computer software reusability; Conducting polymers; Crosslinking; Electron devices; Pressure sensors; Reusability; Sodium alginate; Solvents; Wearable sensors; Conventional approach; Electrical percolation; Electronic interface; Flexible pressure sensors; Physical characterization; Poly(3 ,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate); Poly-3 ,4-ethylenedioxythiophene; Spatial resolution; Hydrogels",Article,Scopus

Wood aggregates are introduced by means of a volumetric substitution for sand. Easily demoldable concrete blocks have been produced by means of vibrocompaction. A high vibration frequency is coupled with a compaction process in order to generate semi-dry cylindrical concrete blocks (100 mm in diameter, 200 mm high). The addition of wood into the cementitious composite exerts a noticeable influence on its workability, as well as on its thermophysical and mechanical behaviour. Wood alters how the cementitious composite is hydrated and has an impact on its mechanical strength in compression, which drops considerably with an increase in sawdust content. A 50% rate of substituting poplar sawdust for sand was chosen for testing purposes.

CO2 laser was used in production of LSG electrodes with high conductivity and multilayer structure by using less laser speed/ power (2.8 cm/s /3.2 W) and low resistivity 58 Ω/square on flexible polyimide sheet leading to the high active surface area of the sensor.

Experimental conditions were optimized, including the concentration of pyrrole monomer, the number of polymerization cycles, the concentration of BPA as template and the incubation time. We evaluated the sensitivity of the LSG-MIP sensor in the concentration range between 0.05 μM and 20 μM with a limit of detection of 8 nM.

The as-synthesized ionogels exhibited a rapid color change from yellow to saffron upon interaction with CN- ions (0.1 equiv). The remarkable features of this detection are that (a) the gel color was changed without losing the physical structural integrity; (b) the color change is reversible in the presence of a proton source, assuring the reusability of the material; and (c) the color change can be identified by the naked eye. The mechanism of the sensing has been investigated using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance titration experiments.

Aerosol jet printing of polyimide and silver nanowires enables multifunctional strain sensors with tunable resistance and gauge factor. Experimental study of soft material compositions and multilayered structures of the strain sensor demonstrates the capabilities of strong adhesion and conformal lamination on different surfaces without the use of conventional fixtures and/or tapes. A two-axis, printed strain gauge enables the detection of force-induced strain changes on a curved stem valve for structural health management while offering reusability over 10 times without losing the sensing performance. Direct comparison with a commercial film sensor captures the advantages of the printed soft sensor in enhanced gauge factor and sensitivity. Another type of a stretchable strain sensor in skin-wearable applications demonstrates a highly sensitive monitoring of a subject's motion, pulse, and breathing, validated by comparing it with a clinical-grade system. Overall, the presented comprehensive study of materials, mechanics, printing-based fabrication, and interfacial adhesion shows a great potential of the printed soft strain sensor for applications in continuous structural health monitoring, human health detection, machine-interfacing systems, and environmental condition monitoring. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","and human physiology monitoring; nanoparticle printing; printed strain sensor; soft materials; structural health monitoring","Adhesion; Condition monitoring; Patient monitoring; Physiology; Reusability; Silver nanowires; Soft materials; Strain gages; Wearable sensors; Aerosol jet printings; Continuous structural health monitoring; Environmental conditions; Human Machine Interface; Interfacial adhesions; Multi-layered structure; Structural health managements; Wearable applications; Structural health monitoring; nanowire; silver; breathing; chemistry; devices; electronic device; human; mechanical stress; movement (physiology); physiologic monitoring; printing; pulse rate; Young modulus; Elastic Modulus; Humans; Monitoring, Physiologic; Movement; Nanowires; Printing; Pulse; Respiration; Silver; Stress, Mechanical; Wearable Electronic Devices",Article,Scopus

The structural and morphological properties of as-prepared materials were studied by powder X-ray diffraction method, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron micrographic images and transmission electron micrographic images. The photoluminescence behavior of Sm3+-doped SrWO4 for visible excitation (405 nm) was examined to analyze its use as white LED. The emission spectra consist of intra 4f transition of Sm3+ such as 4G 5 / 2→ 6H 5 / 2 (561 nm), 4G 5 / 2→ 6H 7 / 2 (601 nm), 4G 5 / 2→ 6H 9 / 2 (642 nm) and 4G 5 / 2→ 6H 11 / 2 (711 nm), respectively. Furthermore, the emission wavelength at 601 and 642 nm suggests a strong orange and red emission, which can be applied for the application for near-UV excitation. On the other hand, Sm3+-doped SrWO4 played excellent catalyst towards the photodegradation of Ibuprofen (IBF). The obtained results from the UV-Vis spectroscopy suggested that 3% of Sm3+-doped SrWO4 had high photocatalytic activity compared to other materials.

The SLM-produced porous Fe-based MG matrix composite has been employed into catalytic activation in Fenton-like process and sulfate radical-based reaction. Results demonstrate that up to 45 times reusability is achieved in sulfate radical-based reaction without any apparent efficiency decay, which is the highest reusability with high efficiency by catalysts as of now. The remarkable catalytic reusability originates from extremely low surface decay in sulfate radical-based reaction. In addition, structural analysis indicates the α-Fe nanocrystals could trigger easy electron transfer but a large amount of α-Fe lead to an inhibitive catalytic effect in the MG matrix composite.

The uses of BP-based materials in pollution control are emerging. BP possesses puckered honeycomb like structure with high surface area, high charge-carrier mobility, and layer-dependent direct-bandgap (0.3–2.0 eV) for broadband light absorption. These properties make BP a superior material to carry out solar light-based photocatalytic processes. This review presents the current status of these materials in adsorption and photocatalytic processes in removing a wide range of pollutants from water and air. The progress made in elucidating the mechanisms of the processes is discussed. The strong interactions between the active sites of BP and the pollutants (e.g., As(III) and Cr(VI)) result in the excellent efficiency of the materials in pollution remediation of the spiked clean water samples. In the photocatalytic processes, the superior performance for eliminating pollutants (e.g., dyes) is attributed to the improved light harvesting and reduced recombination of the photo-induced electrons and holes. Importantly, BP-based composites possess significantly enhanced stability and excellent reusability in both adsorptive and photocatalytic processes.

The use of one-part or a “just-add-water” alkali-activated binder aims to avoid the use of alkali-activator solutions which have traditionally been utilized in two-part systems. By using a solid activator, the disadvantages posed by hazardous liquid activators (such as the difficulties of using them on-site) can be minimized. Ceramic materials represent a considerable fraction of construction and demolition wastes, and originate not only from the building process, but also as tiles from industry and rejected bricks. Besides using these waste materials as road sub-base or construction backfill materials, they can also be employed as supplementary cementitious materials or even as raw material for alkali-activated binders. This paper presents the strength development and microstructural results obtained from examining different compositions under various curing conditions (sealing, ambient, and submerged in water). Two different ceramic wastes (with and without firing) were used as a partial replacement (5–10% by mass) of ground granulated blast-furnace slag. Specimens were then cured under three different curing regimes, including: (1) plastic-sealed, (2) unsealed at ambient conditions with an average temperature of 23 °C and 35% RH, and (3) submerged in water until the test date. Mechanical testing (compressive and flexural strengths) and microstructural analysis (SEM/EDX, XRD, MIP, heat of hydration, TGA, and DTA) were used to determine the effects of curing conditions. The results showed that ceramic waste content and type, as well as curing regimes, greatly affect the chemical reaction products, strength development, and structural stability. © 2019, The Author(s).","Ceramic wastes; Curing conditions; Mechanical properties; One-part alkali-activated binders","Blast furnaces; Building materials; Ceramic products; Chemical stability; Curing; Demolition; Hydration; Mechanical properties; Mechanical testing; Slags; Alkali-activated binder; Ceramic waste; Compressive and flexural strengths; Construction and demolition waste; Curing condition; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Microstructural analysis; Supplementary cementitious material; Binders",Article,Scopus

These methods are relevant when reusing structural elements over multiple service lives. Reuse has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of building structures because it avoids sourcing new material, it reduces waste and it requires little energy. When reusing elements, cross-section and length availability have a major influence on the structural design. In previous own work, design of truss structures from a stock of elements was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. It was shown that this method produces solutions which are global optima in terms of stock utilization. This work extends previous formulations to stock-constrained optimization of frame structures subject to ultimate and serviceability limit states hence expanding the range of structural typologies that can be designed through reuse. Fundamental to this method is the globally optimal assignment of available stock elements to member positions in the frame structure. Two scenarios are considered: (A) the use of individual stock elements for each member of the frame, and (B) a cutting stock approach, where multiple members of the frame are cut from a single stock element. Numerical case studies are presented to show the applicability of the proposed method to practical designs. To carry out the case studies, a stock of elements was inventoried from shop drawings of deconstructed buildings. Results show that through reusing structural elements a significant reduction of embodied greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved compared to optimized structures made of new elements. © Copyright © 2020 Brütting, Senatore, Schevenels and Fivet.","assignment problem; cutting stock problem; frame structures; greenhouse gas emissions; Life Cycle Assessment; reuse; structural optimization",,Article,Scopus

Microscopic results indicated that 2D BN NSs mostly consisted of thin layers, with lateral sizes of 0.5 to 2 μm. Further, strongly coupled dual catalytic sites of 0D Au and c-axis oriented 1D hexagonal hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanorods were successfully immobilized and uniformly distributed on the surfaces of 2D BN NSs (Au/HAp/BN). A detailed study of Au/HAp/BN formation mechanism is presented in this paper. This study showed that due to the intriguing morphological, structural, and compositional features of Au/HAp/BN ternary nanohybrids, they can be used as an efficient heterogeneous catalytic oxidation system for oxidizing glycerol into lactic acid. In particular, the localized surface of BN was shown to exhibit high affinity toward adsorbing glycerol via higher adsorption affinity; therefore, an oxidizing reaction was obtained at the dual catalytic sites of Au and HAp in the heterogeneous catalytic system of Au/HAp/BN. On the Au/HAp/BN catalyst, 100% glycerol conversion yield was obtained with a high selective production of lactic acid (99.5%) in its base condition at a temperature of 100 °C. Different effects of the NaOH-glycerol molar ratio, reaction time of the catalytic activity, and selectivity of the Au/HAp/BN catalyst suggested that the dual-route reaction pathway was responsible for dehydrating glycerol to lactic acid; this has been elucidated in the paper. Reusability experiments showed the chemical stability and prolonged usage of the Au/HAp/BN catalyst, which can be beneficial for industrial applications.

To reduce substantially material consumption and waste caused by the construction industry, structures can be designed and built with reused elements. Structural element reuse involves: element sourcing and deconstruction, reconditioning and transport. As these processes also generate environmental impacts, reuse might not always be preferred over new construction. This paper presents a method to design reticular structures with minimal environmental impact made from reused and new elements. The formulation given in this paper is based on a combination of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and discrete structural optimization. The LCA carried out in this work accounts for impacts generated from sourcing reclaimed elements to the assembly of the structure. Structural optimization is subject to stress constraints on element capacity and deflection limits for serviceability. Typical loading scenarios are considered. The method is applied to the design of three single-span steel trusses of different topology subject to 100 simulated stocks of reusable elements that have varying cross-sections and lengths. Benchmarks against minimum-weight solutions made solely from recycled steel show that this method produces structures with up to 56% lower environmental impact. Depending on stock availability, the lowest environmental impact is achieved through a combination of reused and new elements. © 2020","Environmental impact reduction; Life Cycle Assessment; Reuse; Structural optimization","Construction industry; Ecodesign; Integer programming; Life cycle; Structural optimization; Fabrication process; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Loadbearing structure; Material consumption; Mixed integer linear programming; Reuse; Structural elements; Varying cross section; Environmental impact",Article,Scopus

The adsorption of La, Y, Nd and Dy on InXL and InXS was endothermic in nature and followed by Langmuir isotherm displaying the homogenous adsorption with maximum adsorption capacities of 191.02, 214.89, 231.58 and 245.42 mg/g, and 192.82, 186.16, 183.93, and 171.86 mg/g, respectively. In a multi-component system, InXS displayed preferential adsorption for La, which could be selectively recovered by the simultaneous application of both materials. The post-adsorption results of REEs adsorption on InXS inferred that the possible mechanism involved was only electrostatic interaction between hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, meanwhile, ion exchange and surface complexation also occurred in case of InXL. The incorporation of InXL in mixed matrix polymeric membrane showed potential for removal of La, Y, Nd and Dy, implying that fabricated nanocomposite could be utilized efficiently in other modules for recovery of REEs. The high adsorption capacities for nanocomposites prepared via simple route yielding good reusability has the potential to be used for the recovery of REEs from the waste stream. © 2020 The Authors","Inorganic matrices; Membrane separation; Nanocomposites; Recovery; Xanthan gum","Adsorption; Biopolymers; Ion exchange; Isotherms; Morphology; Nanocomposites; Neodymium; Polymer matrix composites; Rare earths; Recovery; Reusability; Silica; Thermogravimetric analysis; High adsorption capacity; Inorganic matrices; Layered double hydroxides; Membrane separation; Multi-component systems; Preferential adsorption; Rare earth elements (REEs); Single-component systems; Xanthan gum",Article,Scopus

In this paper, a new radiation-induced reduction-exfoliation method is introduced to achieve the one-step exfoliation of h-BN to form Ni-nanoparticle-(NiNP)-bound BNNS (Ni/BNNS) in a binary isopropanol/water medium using gamma-ray radiation at ambient temperature and pressure. The process involves the effective intercalation of Ni2+ ions into h-BN interlayers dispersed in the isopropanol/water medium, followed by the in situ growth of NiNPs under gamma-ray irradiation. Taking advantage of the volume expansion effect generated by the growth of the NiNPs and with help from a cationic surfactant, such as hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC), sheet-like Ni/BNNS in 200 nm squares and with an average BNNS thickness of less than 5 nm can be peeled from h-BN and stably dispersed in water. The prepared magnetic Ni/BNNS exhibits good catalytic performance, excellent structural stability, and reusability toward the reduction of 2-nitroaniline (2-NA). After 5 cycles, the conversion of 2-NA still reaches 95.9% within 500 s. More interestingly, when Ni/BNNS was dispersed in water/methanol solution at a content of 0.17 mg mL-1 followed by exposure to simulated sunlight irradiation, H2 evolution of 8404.3 μmol gNi-1 within 2 h can be detected. This work not only provides a new idea for realizing the exfoliation of layers of nanoscale sheets from h-BN, but it also opens a new route to the one-step preparation of two-dimensional-material-supported nanometal catalysts by taking advantage of gamma-ray radiation.

Conventionally, software tools use time-driven schemes and many components must be computed at every sampling time-point. Event-driven simulation aims at lowering this burden, by calling only those components whose state is evolving quickly. The article explores a model based on DEVS formalism and Quantized State Systems (QSS) techniques. Within this paradigm shift, our strategy was to reuse as much widely accepted knowledge as possible. One immediate difficulty was, that the well-known conduction heat transfer function (CHTF) of multi-layered walls is not suitable for DEVS in its traditional form since it is constrained to sample at a fixed time step. Instead, the paper introduces a non-conventional method: the Successive State Transition method (SST). Its distinguishing traits are: it allows variable time steps, has high accuracy and its computational workload adapts to the elapsed time between transitions. Unfortunately, although we found that SST and QSS work well together, the paper shows that the aforementioned transfer function is not adequate for event-driven simulations. Based on the paper outcomes, we propose a workaround for further research: a new transfer function, relating the conduction heat flux (input) to the time derivative of the wall superficial temperature (output) (recall that the traditional input-output relationship: superficial temperature and conduction heat flux, respectively).

However, brickwork is mostly demolished long before the end of its technical service life; the majority are crushed to form aggregate or else landfilled. Urban mining and circular economy are stimulating interest in the potential to recover structural products from end-of-service-life buildings for direct reuse. For brickwork, separating bricks from cement-based mortar, as opposed to lime-based mortar, without damage to bricks is a major barrier. This paper presents two advanced techniques based on saw-cutting and punching, to demonstrate the technical feasibility of brick reclamation. Compared to new bricks, reclaimed bricks have similar visual appearance and their compressive strength differs by −4.8% to +40%.

The municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) generates fly ash, which is a toxic waste. Coal fly ash (CFA) and flue gas desulfurization (FGD) derive from the thermoelectric coal plant located in the same city. Along with these ashes, silica fume and rice husk ash are also considered for the stabilization of fly ash based on their amorphous silica content with the aim to convert them into an inert material. The characterization of all the investigated ashes was performed using different techniques: X-ray diffraction, total reflection X-ray fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The aim of this work is to describe the reuse possibilities that were proposed for these ashes, which were determined also on the basis of their structural properties. Several possible applications of the investigated ashes are proposed, and the most suitable reuse of stabilized fly ash samples seems to be the production of sustainable plastic composites.

Reuse on-site represents, in particular for remote sites, a significant contribution to sustainable business practice as it provides a higher value end use when used to develop on-site mulch to enable soil improvement, reducing transport emissions (from the least preferred option of off-site disposal to landfill), reducing costs, and employing local contractors. The objective of the study was to enable on-site reuse, which was primarily achieved through chemical and physicochemical characterization of EOLPM streams; cardboard, and wood. Given the common occurrence of these materials in the rapidly growing renewable energy sector, it represents an important scope of work for the sector internationally. The methods used for characterization of the EOLPM, the first of its type reported, included a range of organic and inorganic chemical analyses, phytotoxicity testing, followed by an environmental and high-level (or initial) financial benefit cost analysis. Key scientific findings were that only trace concentrations of chemicals of potential concern (COPC) were detected; the material was not phytotoxic and has potential for soil improvement at the site, and the selected option of on-site reuse (of the materials as a mulch) had a global warming potential of 50 times less than the business as usual option (transport to landfill). The results also demonstrated the broader potential for using EOLPMs from USSE sites for soil improvement at remote locations rather than transporting offsite for disposal or reuse. Structural changes will need to be made to the way in which markets operate to achieve circular economy outcomes for these EOLPMs. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Circular economy; Cost-benefit analysis; Mulch; Packaging; Waste","Chemical analysis; Costs; Energy policy; Global warming; Inorganic chemicals; Land fill; Packaging materials; Soil pollution; Soils; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Disposal to landfills; Global warming potential; Physico-chemical characterization; Phytotoxicity testing; Renewable energy sector; Sustainable business; Trace concentrations; Transport emissions; Cost benefit analysis; inorganic compound; organic compound; alternative energy; packaging waste; photovoltaic system; physicochemical property; renewable resource; soil improvement; solar power; Article; cost benefit analysis; economic aspect; electric power plant; greenhouse effect; landfill; physical chemistry; phytotoxicity assay; recycling; renewable energy; soil management; solar energy; solar photovoltaic; waste disposal; waste management; Chemical Analysis; Costs; Land Fill; Packaging Materials; Reuse; Sites; Soil; Upgrading",Article,Scopus

After consumption, goods end-up in local waste streams and landfilled because of poorly developed waste management systems. This paper proposes a methodology to extend responsibility to exporting country manufacturers for indirect waste disposal in developing countries through imported goods. It establishes a functional relationship between the weight and volume of the imported goods and the local municipal solid waste stream derived from their consumption, by adapting the recycling concepts of by-product and co-product to the municipal solid waste stream derived from the household sector. A lexicon is formalized to conceptualize an extended-producer-responsibility information system operating at the global level between exporting and importing countries. This EPR system i) determines the recyclability, reusability and treatability attributes of imported goods based on their constitutive parts (primary package or product), as well as the material value as per the net value in the global waste market and final destination once consumed, ii) defines specific conditions regarding the goods´ materials value and structural configuration of their constitutive parts for inclusion in Free-Trade Agreement clauses, and iii) checks for the fulfilment of these proposed conditions. The proposed methodology was validated with a case study on Panama. It was found that 24%(w/w)-34.5%(v/v) of valued materials derived from goods imported in Panama through FTAs could be exported back to the country of origin, 18%(w/w)-2.8%(v/v) could be locally reused, and 58%(w/w)-62.5%(v/v) locally valorized.

GFe2 and GFe3 exhibit different iron component crystal patterns; from our results, we deduced that S-doping improves the electron transportation in the Fenton reaction. GFe2 also exhibits a better spherical structure and a higher specific area than GFe3 due to the support of the FeS nanospheres. To further increase structural advantage, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was added to alginate hydrogel during in-situ pyrolysis, which further converts GFe2 into a more porous structure (PGFe). Experiments show that the organic removal efficiency of the samples are ordered as GFe3 &lt; GFe2 &lt; PGFe, which acts as additional evidence for the importance of S doping and the structural support that PVA offers which produces more active sites and faster electron transportation. PGFe shows a high reusability after 5 runs of repetitive use in tetracycline (TC) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) degradation. The removal rate of PFOA increased from 15.4% to 21.6% using PGFe; though not as significant as its effects on TC. The C7, C8, F23, and O24 atoms of PFOA are found easier to be attacked by hydroxyl radicals. Having used drinking and black odorous water to further evaluate the practical properties and industrial potentials of the aerogel, PGFe also shows a significant effect in degrading a variety of pollutants, both organic and heavy metal. This clearly demonstrates the promising potentials of Fe/S-doped carbon aerogel. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Alginate; Carbon aerogel; Fenton; In-situ pyrolysis; Organic pollutant","Aerogels; Alginate; Degradation; Doping (additives); Efficiency; Heavy metals; Hydrogels; Organic pollutants; Oxidation; Potable water; Pyrolysis; Reusability; Water pollution; Water treatment; Carbon aerogels; Electron transportation; Fenton; Industrial potentials; Perfluorooctanoic acid; Pollutant degradation; Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA); Structural advantage; Iron compounds; alginic acid; drinking water; ferrous sulfide; ground water; heavy metal; hydrogel; hydrogen peroxide; hydroxyl radical; iron; lake water; nanosphere; perfluorooctanoic acid; polyvinyl alcohol; sulfur; surface water; tetracycline; alginate; carbon; catalyst; degradation; iron; organic pollutant; pyrolysis; sulfur; Article; bioremediation; chemical structure; controlled study; electron transport; Fenton reaction; organic pollution; pH; porosity; priority journal; pyrolysis; water pollutant; water quality; water treatment",Article,Scopus

However, depending on their physicochemical properties (e.g., chemical structures), non-phenolic TrOCs appear to be resistant to laccase-catalysed degradation, thus requiring an additional treatment process. In this study, the performance of an integrated laccase and persulfate (PS) mediated oxidation process was explored and elucidated for the first time. Compared to that achieved during treatment with laccase alone, the addition of PS at 1-10 mM concentration into batch enzymatic bioreactors showed concentration-dependent improvement in the degradation of the five TrOCs selected, namely diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, bisphenol A and oxybenzone. The results obtained from a series of batch tests also confirmed that the structural components (e.g., carbohydrate moieties in the enzyme) as well as the possibility of PS acting as a final acceptor of electrons from the type II and type III active sites of laccase may have led to PS activation. A continuous treatment system was developed by integrating a nanofiltration (NF) membrane with the laccase/PS process (NF-MBRlaccase/PS), which achieved TrOC-specific degradation. Importantly, the degradation of non-phenolic TrOCs (diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine) further improved by 10 to 65% in the NF-MBRlaccase/PS system. This improvement could be attributed to: (i) the prolonged contact time between laccase/PS and TrOCs, which was possible due to their complete retention by the NF membrane; and (ii) retention of oxidative cross coupling agents or secondary radicals enhancing TrOC degradation. The NF membrane not only retained the moderately degraded carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole effectively but also effectively removed toxic transformation products and residual estrogenicity of the final effluent as evaluated by cytotoxicity and estrogenicity assays, respectively. These observations indicate the significance of the high retention membrane in the NF-MBRlaccase/PS system for producing high quality permeate suitable for disposal and potentially for water reuse applications. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry..",,"Amides; Biological water treatment; Catalysis; Coupling agents; Effluents; Physicochemical properties; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Additional treatment; Concentration-dependent; Continuous treatments; Oxidation process; Structural component; Sulfamethoxazole; Trace organic contaminants; Transformation products; Enzymes; catalyst; concentration (composition); degradation; membrane; oxidation; toxicity; trace element",Article,Scopus

Thereinto, the activation effect of 2.0 wt% S-OMC improved most significantly after it reached the adsorption equilibrium, and the removal rate of PNP was 82.02%. The optimal experimental effect can be achieved at room temperature and unadjusted pH (pH = 6), retrenching energy and chemical input for practical applications. Higher temperatures could cause radical quenching, while electrostatic repulsion existed between S-OMC and PNP at pH &gt; 6.03, which led to a reduction of PNP removal. Moreover, the structural features and surface characters of S-OMC were studied and found that the defect structure and surface functional groups had noticeable influence on the reusability of S-OMC.

For crack sensing tags, however, the short service life of tags restricted their application. This paper aims to introduce a method of surface crack detection and monitoring based on RFID tag, which makes it possible for tags to be reused. Design/methodology/approach: Metal plate to be monitored, acting as the ground plane of microstrip patch antenna, is underneath the crack sensing tag. The propagating surface crack in metal plate will change the electric length of tag’s antenna that is directly proportional to the crack depth and length. Thus, the deformation of sensing tag introduced by the load on metal structure is no longer a prerequisite for crack sensing. Findings: The simulated and experimental results show that the proposed crack sensing tag can sense the change of surface crack with mm-resolution and sense surface crack propagation without a deformation, which means the proposed crack sensing tag can be reused.

These materials were reviewed with emphasis on the experimental parameters (initial dye concentration, pH, adsorbent dosage etc.) and outcomes of the various adsorption studies were discussed. Furthermore, the isotherm models, kinetic and thermodynamic of the adsorption studies involved were also summarized.

After systematic evaluation, the pseudo-first-order kinetic constant rate of TiO2/kaolinite composite can reach to 0.04549 min−1, which was 6.90 and 1.81 times higher than that of pure TiO2 and P25, respectively. The nano-TiO2/kaolinite composite photocatalyst also displayed good reusability performance, only a slight decline occurred after four repeated experiments, which is beneficial for the large-scale application of photocatalysts. Various characterizations indicated that enhanced photocatalytic performance can be ascribed to the synergistic effect between natural kaolinite and the well distributed TiO2, which enhanced the light absorption ability, assisted the dispersion of pure TiO2, resulted in co-catalysis effect, improved the separation facilitation of photo-induced carriers and promoted the stronger adsorption capacity, etc. These merits effectively regulated the carriers’ lifetime and migration velocity of the photogenerated charge carriers.

Adaptive reuse has the potential to maximize the residual utility and value of existing assets through green design methods such as selective disassembly planning. Studies in the field of selective disassembly are scarce and there is no evidence of established methodologies for the optimization of the environmental and financial benefits. A multi-objective analysis is key to obtaining several effective selective disassembly plans for the adaptive reuse of an existing asset through the combination of different deconstruction methods. The analysis is carried out in terms of the physical, environmental, and economic constraints of the deconstruction methods per building component. The Sequential Disassembly Planning for Buildings (SDPB) method is used in order to generate the optimized disassembly plans for retrieving target components. At the end, a weighted multi-objective optimization analysis is incorporated to generate the set of noninferior solutions that minimizes environmental impacts and building cost. The results show that different complete disassembly plans exist for all the possible combinations. The possible combinations are driven by the deconstruction methods per component, as well as the dismantling interdependence. The method described in this study can be used to improve the project outcomes according to specific goals and constraints (e.g. environmental, economic, technical).

Herein, a metal–organic framework (MOF) UiO-66-NH2 was used as an ideal support to encapsulate Pd nanoparticles (Pd@UiO-66-NH2) via a simple double solvents method. This composite was characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, FT-IR, TEM, HAADF-STEM, EDS, TGA, XPS, and ICP-AES. Comprehensive characterization results reveal that metallic Pd particles are confined in the MOF cavities with good dispersion, which interact with the amine group in the framework. Pd@UiO-66-NH2 was applied to the hydrogenation of biomass-derived levulinic acid (LA) to γ-valerolactone (GVL) for the first time. Owing to the high dispersion of Pd and the confinement effect of MOF cavities, the catalytic activity and reusability of Pd@UiO-66-NH2 were greatly enhanced in comparison with the reference catalysts. It gives the highest GVL productivity (1741.1 mmol g−1h−1) as compared to other reported Pd-based heterogeneous catalysts, and it also exhibits excellent reusability despite the loss of two organic linkers during the catalyst recycling experiment.

The as-prepared polymorphs were characterized by using XRD, FTIR, EDX, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, XPS, BET and UV–vis. analyses. The analytical results indicated that a metastable α-AgVO3 was formed in the precipitation method, whereas it was irreversibly converted into thermodynamically stable β-AgVO3 by a hydrothermal method at 120 °C. The hydrothermal treatment was found to be decisive for the formation of β-form with high crystallinity and phase purity. The increase of hydrothermal temperature to 150 °C and 180 °C could not contributed to a significant variation in the crystalline, structural, textural and optical properties of the β-AgVO3. Moreover, a plausible mechanism for the phase transformation was briefly discussed. A combination of the needle and rod-like nanostructures of α form was completely changed to nanorods in β form after hydrothermal treatment. The optical band gap of α and β AgVO3 polymorphs was found to be 1.91 eV and 1.98 eV respectively. The photocatalytic activity of the silver vanadates for the degradation of Rhodamine B indicated that β-AgVO3 nanorods were better than α-AgVO3 polymorphs. This could be attributed to the significant effects of its stable crystalline structure rather than specific surface area. Moreover, due to the reduced grain boundaries in β-form, their electron-hole recombination rate was lowed compared to α form. The degradation efficiency reached to 56% within 180 min under visible light irradiation. However, the increase of hydrothermal temperature does not have a significant effect in the photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the β-AgVO3 nanorods were successfully reused for five cycles of photodegradation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AgVO3 nanorods; Crystalline polymorphs; Optical properties; Photodegradation; Reusability","Chromium compounds; Crystalline materials; Crystallinity; Degradation; Energy gap; Grain boundaries; Nanorods; Optical properties; Phase transitions; Photodegradation; Precipitation (chemical); Reusability; Silver compounds; Structural properties; Crystalline polymorphs; Degradation efficiency; Electron hole recombination rate; Hydrothermal temperature; Hydrothermal treatments; Photocatalytic property; Thermodynamically stable; Visible-light irradiation; Photocatalytic activity",Article,Scopus

The proposed connection system has several advantages such as rapid assembly and disassembly, reusability, and replaceability if damaged during an earthquake event. An experimental investigation was first carried out to determine the seismic performance of the proposed connections. In total, six full-scale precast and monolithic T-shape beam-column connection specimens with different reinforcement ratios, specimen dimensions and detailing were tested under displacement controlled cyclic loading, while the axial load on the column was kept constant. The cyclic behaviour, curvature distribution, failure mode, energy dissipation capacity and ductility of the specimens were obtained using the experimental outputs. Detailed non-linear finite element (FE) models were then developed using ABAQUS. It is shown that the FE models can accurately predict the overall performance of the precast connections in terms of initial stiffness, lateral load-bearing capacity and post-peak behaviour. The results indicate that, in general, the precast connections exhibited considerably higher (up to 34%) ductility and ultimate drift ratio (deformability) compared to similar monolithic connections. For the same drift ratio, monolithic connections exhibited slightly higher (on average 10%) energy dissipation capacity, while the precast connections generally dissipated higher energy at their ultimate point (post-peak lateral drift corresponding to 15% loss in lateral strength). It is demonstrated that the monolithic-like precast connections can satisfy the ACI 318-14 acceptance criteria, while they also sustain the ASCE 41-17 Collapse Prevention (CP) limits. Therefore, the proposed connection system is considered to be suitable for RC structures in seismic regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cyclic loading; Ductility; Monolithic-like connections; Precast concrete; Seismic performance","ABAQUS; Connectors (structural); Cyclic loads; Displacement control; Ductility; Energy dissipation; Reinforced concrete; Reusability; Seismic waves; Seismology; Analytical investigations; Curvature distributions; Energy dissipation capacities; Experimental investigations; Non-linear finite elements; Precast connections; Reinforcement ratios; Seismic Performance; Precast concrete; analytical framework; column; concrete structure; cyclic loading; ductility; earthquake engineering; experimental study; reinforced concrete; reinforcement; seismic design; seismic response; structural component",Article,Scopus

An oil-in-oil (o/o) HIPE of ϵ-caprolactone monomer (CL) was made for this purpose, and the ring-opening polymerization of a continuous phase comprised of CL, catalyst (Sn(Oct)2), and cross-linker (bis(caprolactone-4-yl)) (BCY) was carried out.

Enhanced oil adsorption of nGO-functionalized scaffolds proved them to be of higher potency compared to those made of neat PCL.

For the first time, MSWI fly ash (FA) is treated using MSWI bottom ash (BA), which is considered as a new urban mining source due to its pozzolanic characteristics. The proposed technology involves mixing these ashes with two other components: flue gas desulphurization residue and coal fly ash. Thermal annealing at a low temperature (120 °C for 4 h) can also be performed, to accelerate some reactions, but it is not necessary for stabilization. The efficacy of the process is demonstrated by the comparison of elemental concentrations in leaching solutions that are detected in the untreated ashes and the obtained stabilized materials, which show the reduced solubility of leachable Zn and Pb (with respect to the starting MSWI FA). The chemical, morphological, and structural characterization of the obtained materials makes it possible to propose and discuss a stabilization mechanism, which was attributed to carbonation and formation of calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H). In particular, for the stabilized sample, X-ray Diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of calcite, whereas the sample morphology shows some fibrils that may be due to amorphous C–S–H with a Ca/Si ratio that is slightly smaller than 1.5. Because the proposed method employs wastes produced at the same location, it is reasonable to conclude that the method may be directly applied to incinerator plants due to the simplification of the MSWI FA waste management strategy, which generally involves its transport and stabilization treatment before landfilling. Finally the saved carbon dioxide emissions and the economic benefits that are a result of the new urban mining proposed approach have been evaluated for Europe. In particular the avoid of MSWI FA landfilling was evaluated to save approximately 1.6 M€/day, and the saved carbon dioxide emissions introduced into the atmosphere is approximately 960 kt/year. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bottom ash; Circular economy; Fly ash; Municipal solid waste incineration; Pb; Stabilization; Zn","Ash handling; Ashes; Calcite; Calcium silicate; Carbon dioxide; Coal ash; Economics; Fly ash; Global warming; Lead; Municipal solid waste; Silicate minerals; Stabilization; Temperature; Waste treatment; X ray powder diffraction; Zinc; Bottom ash; Calcium silicate hydrate; Circular economy; Elemental concentrations; Flue gas desulphurization; Stabilization treatments; Structural characterization; Waste management strategies; Waste incineration",Article,Scopus

In this study, we first demonstrate the development of rod-like zero-valent iron (rZVI) multistack nanoassemblies and examine their superior catalytic capability with microfluidic on-chip platform. rZVI having an average dimension of 27 nm in diameter and 98 nm in length is easily synthesized during the reduction of ferric chloride by sodium borohydride with ethanol as the solvent. The effect of a series of parameters (including precursor type, solvent type, reducing agent concentration, and reaction time) on structural changes is investigated. Miniaturized five-loop spiral-shaped microfluidic device is employed, as a proof of concept, to evaluate the Fenton-like catalytic degradation capability of organic dyes (methylene blue, Rhodamine B, trypan blue, doxorubicin, and methyl orange). In comparison to conventional batch catalysis system, such microfluidic on-chip system could significantly reduce the runtime from a timescale of hours to only seconds. In addition, on-chip catalysis performance can be well regulated by resident time (the longer the resident time, the higher the degradation efficiency), and rZVI shows superior reusability even after eight cycles.

Results from the electron spin resonance experiments showed that one could easily increase the number of main oxidative species, i.e. [rad]OH radicals, of the BC/TiO2 composite by using smaller TiO2 nanoparticles and further nitrogen doping, exhibiting higher photocatalytic reactivity.

Herein, we have demonstrated a single satisfactory resolution to address this problem. To this end, four new metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), namely, [{Ni(5N3-IPA)(4,4′-azp)(H2O)}]∞ (1), [{Zn2(5N3-IPA)2(4,4′-azp)2}(H2O)8]∞ (2), [{Cd(5N3-IPA)(4,4′-azp)0.5(H2O)}(H2O)]∞ (3), and [{Mn(5N3-IPA)(4,4′-azp)}]∞ (4), are derived from 5-azidoisophthalic acid (5N3-H2IPA) and 4,4′-azopyridine (4,4′-azp), followed by a mixed ligand approach exploiting solvothermal methods. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) analysis reveals that all of the MOFs (1-4) exhibit two-dimensional (2D) structures. Remarkably, MOFs 1, 2, and 3 exhibit excellent aqueous phase stability, which is confirmed by powder XRD (PXRD) measurements. Because of the insolubility of these MOFs in common organic solvents, a simple and convenient route is adapted to reduce the particle size of the as-synthesized materials to produce nanoscale MOFs (NMOFs). As suggested by the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies, nanospherical, nut-shaped, and nanorodlike morphologies are observed for NMOFs 1, 2, and 3, respectively, which supports the formation of nanostructures. When subjected to photoluminescence studies, aqueous suspensions of NMOFs 1, 2, and 3 are found to be highly luminescent in nature. Subsequently, detection of toxic Cr2O7 2- and CrO4 2- is comprehensively tested using these NMOFs (1, 2, and 3) in water. Among the tested NMOFs, 2 exhibits exceptional capability for selective detection of both Cr2O7 2- and CrO4 2- in the aqueous phase with very high quenching constants and very low detection limits (on ppm level). The mechanistic aspect of the detection phenomena is further assessed by time-resolved fluorescence measurements and UV-vis studies. To explain such an incredible affinity of the host framework toward CrVI oxoanions, we performed density functional theoretical (DFT) calculations. N2 and CO2 adsorption measurements establish the presence of intrinsic structural porosity in NMOF 2, as indicated by the SXRD data. Furthermore, efficient sorption capacity toward Cr2O7 2- (113.63 mg/g) and excellent reusability manifest the great potential of this material for use in real-life applications.

One of the most expensive systems for any RLV is the thermal protection system (TPS), which protects the vehicle from the high thermal loads during re-entry. The reusability and on-orbit environment are the key parameters for the design of TPS and its materials. Aim of the work is to analyze a novel coating process based on the alumina base coating applied on a TPS for re-entry application. The proposed treatment is due to preserve the thermo-mechanical properties of a Carbon/Carbon substrate from the detrimental space environment conditions, such as LEO thermal cycles, outgassing due to ultra-high vacuum, Atomic Oxygen and UV irradiation. The experimental measurement of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) is performed in order to evaluate the thermal stress and performance of both the substrate and coating layer. Particular emphasis is devoted to the study of the effect of coating/substrate adhesion, which may result in anomalous mechanical behavior. By the use of the inverse method heat capacity and thermal conductivity are analysed. A robust numerical approach, such this inverse method, is one of the best for these problems as many parameters concur for the determination of properties. Such approach permits to perform the parametric and structural identification of the model. These procedures are presented including both experimental investigation and methodical numerical aspects. Special test equipment and the regularizing algorithm for solving the ill-posed inverse heat conduction problem are described. Such approach provides estimating of thermal properties of different types of Carbon/Carbon substrate coating. After thermal conditioning the integrity of the coating and the substrate will be investigated by full microscopy analysis using SEM/EDX techniques. The experimental results are implemented in numerical simulations in order to foresee the overall performance of the material. © 2020 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

Starting from the historical and constructive analysis of the complex, the project of reuse herein proposed has dealt not only with structural and safety issues, but also with the “use” choice, which descends directly from social and territorial aspects. The significance of this intervention is hence related both to its compliance with the principles of the “integrated conservation process” as defined by R. Di Stefano during the 80's, and to the actual architectural and strengthening project, developed on the bases of a throughout historical research. As a matter of fact, the study of historical documentation has shed light on forgotten information that, in the project phase, have turned into design opportunities. The ancient trace of a demolished wing of the complex has become an occasion to place a new portion of the building which, at the same time, meets three different objectives: An efficient functional distribution, the strengthening of the structure and an enhancement of its historical value. At the end of this path, in balance between structural strengthening, functional renewal and preservation of built heritage, the monument will increase its cultural and economic value, gaining a new (social) life. The final aim is thus to show that structural strengthening should always be related to the historical analysis, in order to acquire a thorough understanding of the effects caused by the changes that shaped the building over time [1]. © 2020, University of Cantabria - Building Technology R&D Group.

The challenge of computing the frequency response lies in the computation of the linear system that involves the excitation forces and also the dynamic stiffness which is frequency-dependent. For each frequency, the dynamic stiffness must be updated and a new factorization must be performed, which introduces a high computational cost on the solutions of the linear systems. Alternatively, iterative solver such as GMRES can be applied to avoid the cost of factorization, however they require good preconditioners that are traditionally also frequency-dependent. In the new approach, the dynamic stiffness operator is updated with the frequency whereas the preconditioner is kept constant for a range of frequencies serving as a low-cost preconditioner for the iterative solver. This technique saves computation time because a new factorization is avoided for each frequency point. On the other hand, the effectiveness of the delayed preconditioner is destroyed when the frequency of the dynamic operator is too far away from each other. Therefore, we propose a heuristic approach to update the preconditioner when it is underperforming. The algorithm is tested on structural problems and the results show that this approach can drastically reduce the number of iterations for the computation of the frequency response. © 2020 European Association for Structural Dynamics.

The Zn(II) ion-imprinted polymer was prepared by precipitation copolymerisation of methacrylamide and 2,2- azobisisobutyronitrile along with Zn(II) ions and toluene as a functional complexing monomer, initiator, template ion, and porogenic solvent, respectively, in the presence of chitosan. The ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and tetraethyl orthosilicate were used as cross-linking agents. The prepared Zn(II) ion-imprinted polymer was characterised by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy to determine the structural and functional IIP variations before and after Zn(II) adsorption. Characterisation results suggested the formation of Zn(II) ion-imprinted polymer with excellent thermal stability and also have the potential for selective Zn(II) extraction. Further, the Zn(II) sorption using IIP sorbent was also evaluated as a function of pH, IIP sorbent dosages, Zn(II) ion concentration, sorption time, and IIP sorbent reusability. The Zn(II) sorption equilibrium was studied using various isotherm and kinetic models, and the result suggested that the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order model as the best to explain the sorption process. Sorption capacity was calculated using Langmuir isotherm linear equation and its value was found to be 3.06 mg/g. The method detection limit (MDL) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of sorbent were calculated as 0.1 and 0.3 mg/L, respectively.

Rapid urbanization renders it necessary to reduce the consumption of non-renewable natural resources drastically and also to limit the dumping of these materials after the expiration of their service life. In a rapidly progressing country like India, development of infrastructure produces a lot of solid waste. This derives the interest to reuse it by admixing or adding with existing soil to improve its strength properties. The concrete and brick content, which constitutes a major portion of CDW, is called as building derived material (BDM). The shear strength of soil partially replaced with BDM is a significant property that defines its suitability for several applications. However, it is not an intrinsic property and varies with several experimental factors such as relative density of soil and shearing strain at which shear tests are conducted. The present study deals with the behavior of BDM when admixed with locally available red soil tested at different strain rates (1.25 and 2 mm/min). Consolidated undrained triaxial tests are carried out at three different confining pressures (100, 150, and 200 kPa). This study further investigates the effect of the degree of compaction on the shear strength properties of soil–BDM blends. The results obtained from this study show that the addition of BDM to the soil is enhancing the resistance of the soil to deformation under axial load. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Building derived materials; Strain rates; Triaxial tests","Charge density waves; Demolition; Natural resources; Shear flow; Shear strength; Soil mechanics; Soil testing; Soils; Consolidated-undrained triaxial test; Construction and demolition waste; Degree of compaction; Different confining pressures; Experimental factors; Non-renewable natural resources; Rapid urbanizations; Structural elements; Strain rate",Conference Paper,Scopus

During the maintenance process, structural refactoring is performed by remodularizing the source code. Software clustering is a modularization technique to remodularize artifacts of source code aiming to improve readability and reusability. Due to the NP hardness of the clustering problem, evolutionary approaches such as the genetic algorithm have been used to solve this problem. In the structural refactoring literature, there exists no search-based algorithm that employs a hierarchical approach for modularization. Utilizing global and local search strategies, in this paper, a new search-based top-down hierarchical clustering approach, named TDHC, is proposed that can be used to modularize the system. The output of the algorithm is a tree in which each node is an artifact composed of all artifacts in its subtrees and is a candidate to be a software module (i.e., cluster). This tree helps a software maintainer to have better vision on source code structure to decide appropriate composition points of artifacts aiming to create modules (i.e., files, packages, and components). Experimental results on seven folders of Mozilla Firefox with different functionalities and five other software systems show that the TDHC produces modularization closer to the human expert's decomposition (i.e., directory structure) than the other existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm is expected to help a software maintainer for better remodularization of a source code.

Steel framed structures are inherently adaptable and potentially demountable. Reuse instead of the common practice of recycling steel by melting, makes good environmental sense, saving both on resources and carbon emissions. Reuse is commercially and technically viable, as demonstrated by isolated projects. Although steel reuse has been identified as an effective method to reduce the carbon and energy impact of construction, it is in effect only marginally used in practice. We found that although there is a sufficient spread between the price of steel scrap and new steel, this difference cannot be captured by the demolition contractors. In steel multi-storey high-rise building structures, composite construction is the most efficient and economic forms of construction. Composite beams incorporate composite floors with profiled steel sheeting are the most common structural system used in multi-storey high-rise buildings and is seen as one of the most important ways of expanding the use of steel buildings in Europe, i.e. increasing market share. However, in terms of reuse, current composite construction systems require extensive cutting on-site during the demolition process making reuse not viable.

American Concrete Institute and Indian Standard Institute define the high strength concrete as having compressive strength greater than 41.4 MPa and 60 MPa or more respectively. The basic difference between high strength and normal strength concrete relates to the compressive strength that refers to the maximum resistance of a concrete sample to applied pressure and is the most important characteristic and has prime importance to state whether the concrete is suitable for construction or not, though other properties like tensile and flexural strength are being tested for and hence with higher compressive strengths the concrete becomes more desirable. The super plasticizer gives the concrete adequate workability at low water-cement ratios, leading to concrete with greater strength and the addition of super plasticizers can also be implied to increase the workability for the desired water content or decrease the water content for the desired workability. The main objective of the present study is to understand the behaviour of M60 grade high strength concrete by replacing the E-waste plastics in varying percentage along with super plasticizer by reusing the E-waste plastics in the required shape and properties.

In order to enhance the thermal comfort inside such buildings, architects need lightweight thermal storage. In this paper a model was used to experimentally investigate Heating Load profiles in lightweight shelters. The profiles were created for the climate in Jordan, then simulated for other climate zones. The proposed design concept was used to create a replacement for a thermal mass in lightweight structures such as shelters; by combining passive solar gain with energy storage embodied within the shelter floor (thermal-floor) to absorb solar radiation. This shelter design decreased the Heating Load during the winter season by acting as heat storage that releases energy at night time after being exposed to solar radiation during the day. The passive design depends on shading elements and overhangs shades to control solar gain during different seasons to prevent overheating during the summer. An experimental investigation of this model was performed to validate the simulation results.

A third strategy is currently (re)emerging: The reuse of structural components over multiple service lives and in new layouts. Still in its infancy, this circular economy strategy disrupts structural design practice in many ways: Rather than manufacturing components after the design of a system, the system is synthesised from a given stock of reclaimed components; versatility, reversibility and transformability become hard requirements for all loadbearing systems and components; costs, performance and environmental assessments span multiple service lifecycles. There is consequently a sudden lack of expertise, design tools, technological solutions and relevant metrics.

The protective structure utilizes NiTi alloy as the matrix, a material with many advantages including excellent compression energy absorption, reusability after unloading, and long life. The mechanical properties of the single-layer model were obtained by static crushing experiments and numerical simulations. Building upon the idea of the monolayer bionic structure design, a two-layer structure is also conceived. Both single-layer and double-layer structures have excellent compression energy absorption and self-recovery capabilities. Compared with the single-layer structure, the double-layer structure showed larger compression deformation and exhibited better energy absorption capacity. These results have important academic and practical significance for improving the impact resistance of protective armor.

Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) was selected as the functional monomer with which to fabricate the IOPPCs. By precisely adjusting the molar ratio between the functional monomer and the crosslinker, the sensors were only able to be sensitive to a specific solution, thus realizing the visual, selective, and semi-quantitative detection of PNP. When the sensors were immersed in different concentrations of PNP solution, their Bragg diffraction wavelengths showed different redshifts.

Recently, interest in applications of lignin, especially as an adsorbent material is increasing. However, the physicochemical complexity of lignin significantly reduces access to practical environmental remediation processes. Also, there is a limitation because the adsorption performance of the pristine lignin materials is not superior to that of commercial adsorbent and ion exchange resin material. In this study, spherical lignin particles with high physicochemical stability and excellent Cr(VI) adsorption capacity are prepared using a polyethylenimine (PEI) modification strategy. This modification process significantly improves the mechanical properties and water stability of lignin by complementing the instability of lignin particles. In addition, the PEI-lignin particles exhibit a superior Cr(VI) removal capability (657.9 mg/g, the highest value for a PEI-modified natural adsorbent), which is attributed to their structural stability and introduced amine functional groups. The Cr(VI) removal with PEI-lignin particles is performed via intra-particle diffusion and adsorption followed by covalent bonding combined with a reduction process. Moreover, the PEI-lignin particles exhibit excellent reusability, which sustains their high adsorption efficiency over a long and repeated adsorption period. The results herein strongly support the potential use of PEI-lignin particles as a high performance bio-sorption material for heavy metal removal and its detoxification in aqueous wastewater streams.

Among practical alternatives, ceria-supported transition metal oxides have been proved to be the satisfactory catalysts for soot oxidation due to their outstanding redox properties and oxygen transfer capability promoted by the strong interaction between metal oxide and ceria interfaces. Following the above considerations, in the present work, CuO/Zn-CeO2 nanocomposite was prepared by a wet impregnation method and investigated for catalytic soot oxidation. To probe the significance of nanocomposites, pure counterparts, namely, CuO/CeO2, CuO/ZnO, and Zn-CeO2, were also synthesized. Various characterization techniques, namely, TEM-HRTEM, N2O chemisorption, XRD, ICP-OES, BET, Raman, XPS, and H2-TPR, were employed to investigate the structural, surface, and redox properties. Pure CuO/ZnO and CuO/CeO2 catalysts showed a soot oxidation activity with a T50 of 613 and 526 °C, respectively, under the practical conditions of NO concentration of 500 ppm and 20% O2. Interestingly, the CuO/Zn-CeO2 nanocomposite exhibited a remarkable higher soot oxidation activity with a T50 of 460 °C. The enhancement in the soot oxidation activity has been attributed to a strong interaction between the highly dispersed CuO and Zn-CeO2 support, which resulted in the desired textural properties and abundant surface defects (Ce3+ species as well as oxygen vacancies). In addition, the long-term stability test verifies an excellent reusability of the CuO/Zn-CeO2 nanocomposite towards soot oxidation without appreciable loss in the activity. The present study demonstrates the significance of ceria-based nanocomposite catalysts for environmental pollutant abatement.

However, the low binding capacity and slow adsorption rate of the currently available HIC media lead to a little supply and high price of the highly purified proteins. Herein, nanofibrous membranes with hydrophobic binding sites were developed for HIC by directly coupling phenyl glycidyl ether on the hydrolyzed cellulose acetate nanofiber membrane (cellulose-phenyl NFM). Scanning electron microscope (SEM), water contact angle (WCA), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis and capillary flow porometer (CFP) were applied to evaluate the physically and chemically structural transformation. The obtained cellulose-phenyl NFMs showed a proper hydrophilcity (WCA = 37°), a relatively high BET surface area (3.6 times the surface area of commercial fibrous membranes), and tortuous-channel structure with through-hole size in the range of 0.25–1.2 μm, which led to a little non-specificity adsorption, high bovine serum albumin adsorption capacity of 118 mg g−1, fast adsorption process within 12 h, good long-term stability and reusability. Moreover, compared with traditional modification methods which always include activation and graft two steps, direct coupling method is more efficient for HIC media fabrication. Therefore, cellulose-phenyl NFMs with outstanding protein adsorption performance could be a kind of promising candidate for HIC.

Reusing structural elements reduces the environmental impacts of building structures because it avoids sourcing new material, it reduces waste and it requires little energy. Designing structures from reused elements is unlike conventional structural design because stock element availability is a design input. In other words, structures must be designed subject to availability of given element characteristics such as length and cross-section type, which have a major influence on the optimal structure layout and form. In this new paradigm structural form follows availability. In this work new computational methods for the synthesis of reticular structures through reuse are formulated to address two scenarios: a) reuse of reclaimed elements from a given stock, and b) design of an element stock which is used as a kit of parts to build diverse structures. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methods. It is shown that structures produced by these methods have a significantly lower environmental impact than minimum weight structures made of new elements.

The structural and morphological characteristics of the copper oxide have been examined with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), UV-visible spectroscopy, and BET surface area analyses. The as-prepared materials have been used for the catalytic degradation of methylene blue dye (MB) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The results have demonstrated that the CuO nanosheets showed an enhanced catalytic performance with good reusability up to the fourth cycle. In addition, the effect of several parameters, including the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide quantities, the reaction temperature and the dye concentration have been also investigated for the degradation reactions of the MB. The kinetic data have revealed that the dye degradation process follows a pseudo-first order model. It should be noted that the activation energy (Ea), enthalpy (ΔH#), entropy (ΔS#) and activation free energy (ΔG#) have been calculated for the oxidation reaction. The CuO nanosheets exhibite an excellent catalytic performance for the degradation of MB.

In order to inform current design practices and provide information to partially evaluate if a steel member can be reused after its service life, construction-induced strains in a typical building were recorded. Specifically, two columns and three Beams of a four-story steel-framed building were instrumented prior to delivery to the construction site using a wireless sensor network. Data were recorded for 48 days, while the structure was erected and the concrete deck poured, up to fireproofing the building. The data were analyzed considering dead load force effects during various construction phases, impacts, and temperatures. The analysis revealed high variations in temperature throughout the structure and consequently significant temperature-induced stresses as well as greater magnitudes of flexural stress in columns than expected. As a result, the recorded stresses differed by 1-120 MPa (0-18 ksi) compared to the theoretically predicted stresses. Yet, the maximum measured stress [160 MPa (23.2 ksi)] was only 46% of the nominal yield strength. Measured stresses were also used to calculate member forces, and the combined member forces resulted in a maximum of 55% of the yield limit.

However, little research has been done for assessing adaptive reuse building projects in terms of life cycle and Circular Economy. Because of the great impact that the building industry has on the environment, failing to optimize buildings’ useful life can result in their residual life cycle expectancy not being fully exploited, and with it, wasting the resources embedded therein, such as Primary Energy Demand. The aim of this study is to develop and test a methodology to analyze the net environmental impacts as well as the building’s cost performance of an adaptive reuse project. This paper focuses on the analysis of the structural system. Results show that the adaptive reuse of the building structure produces a considerable decrease in the environmental impacts and the construction building cost. Distribution of cost among materials and equipment is different from those for a new building, while the distribution cost for labor remains the similar. This study objectively demonstrates the considerable benefits of the adaptive reuse of the structure of an existing asset. In contrast, the non-structural building subsystems have been identified as an area with high potential for improving the existing inefficiencies during the adaptive reuse process. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptive reuse; Circular economy; Environmental savings; Life cycle assessment; Net environmental impact; Primary energy demand","building; energy use; environmental impact; equipment; life cycle analysis; optimization; performance assessment; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Waterloo",Article,Scopus

Two types of fibrous materials, Saffil alumina and KCC cerakwool insulation materials, were selected.

The insulated sandwich structure was heated to 800°C for 2,000 seconds. The temperature profiles of the back side of the titanium plate were measured to compare the heat-shielding performance of the fibrous insulation materials. The microstructure of insulation materials, such as the fiber diameter, fiber orientation, and the parent materials of the fiber, was studied to understand how those characteristics influence the radiative properties of the fiber. The difference in microstructural parameters caused a difference in thermal resistance in the fibrous materials. The Saffil alumina insulation had a better performance than KCC cerakwool insulation because of its small fiber diameter and in-plane fiber orientation.

However, the correct management of this residue allows its reuse and recycling, representing economic gains, besides social and environmental benefits. There are several alternatives to recycling and reusing WCOs and the biodiesel production presents itself as one of the most important. Nevertheless, it is necessary to guarantee the residue quality in order to utilize its potential, as well as a coordinated management of WCO, promoting the correct processing and disposal of this waste. In this context, this article aims to propose an environmentally appropriate WCO onsite handling and collection in Lavras-MG, by evaluating the WCO management at three establishments in the city. The evaluation had taken into account the quantity of WCO generated, handling, storage and collection methods adopted, and the quality of the residue, by analyzing levels of acid, iodine and peroxide and saponification value. The results revealed the current management of the WCO, the actors involved in the management chain, the way the different frying and storage processes influence the WCO quality for reusing and recycling and possible alternatives to improve the management. The WCO management chain, composed of ACAMAR, G-Óleo, E1 and E2, is widespread and shows potential to transform the WCO into several other products, in addition to biodiesel and handmade soap.

One form of re-usability involves hierarchical modelling, where the code and artifacts that model a physical phenomenon are used as the building blocks for more complex coupled physical systems. This reusability mode allows for improvements in constituents sub-models to impact the overall fidelity of the entire system with minimal effort. This benefit, however, hinges upon the ability to provide a fairly loose coupling across model boundaries, where changes in any sub-model do not result in wholesale changes to other sub-models, or in the structure and details of the code for the entire physical system. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and case studies for incorporating sub-workflows as building blocks in a framework for loosely coupled high performance simulations. We outline the issues involved in providing lightweight customization points for full workflows that allows their use unchanged in a nested-workflow setting, while providing each sub-workflow with a separate execution context that ensures non-interference with other parts of the simulation.

Here we prospect the possibility to implement new laser-based Raman technology for innovative sorting of residual medical plastic. Currently, medical plastic waste disposal attached enormous attention in the frame of circular economy for avoiding costs and pollution produced by the incineration procedures. To explore any potential added-value by-product resulted from medical waste we need to understand their structure and properties after medical use. Since medical grade plastics raised questions on their dissimilarity to ordinary polymers, we investigated their structural properties using Raman spectroscopy. Further, an algorithm based on plastic Raman signal could provide information on the type of plastics, potential microbial contaminants on used plastics, the influence of the used substances/drugs on the plastics molecular identity and finally, a database for rapid and cost-effective sorting for proper management.

The findings of the current study reveal that different consumers’ attributes and attitudes trigger different types of recycling behavior when it comes to waste disposal. Pressure from family and friends and perceived behavioral control trigger the behavior of reselling the waste plastic products while consumer’s awareness of consequences and personal attitude toward proper waste disposal leads to reuse or donating that product to someone who can use that plastic product. The understanding of these consumer attributes may help to shape the behavioral outcomes in order to manage waste disposal.

Herein, a highly effective amphiphilic polymeric network capable of absorbing polar and nonpolar solvents was produced using hydrophilic glycerol ethoxylate, a member of star type polyethylene glycol (s-PEG), and different hydrophobic organosilane monomers by bulk polymerization as utilized under an inert atmosphere. In this context, the preparation of amphiphilic polymeric networks was achieved by the reaction between hydroxyl terminated s-PEG and ethoxysilane terminated organosilane without using any initiator, activator or a catalyst. SEM, FTIR, 13C and 29Si CPMAS NMR and TGA are used for morphological, structural and thermal characterization of the prepared materials. Likewise, the absorption behavior of amphiphilic polymeric networks was determined by measuring their swelling ratios in polar and nonpolar solvents. Because of having a hydrophobic and hydrophilic structure in their 3D polymeric structure, the obtained polymeric networks behave as an organogel in oil medium, while they can prepared as a hydrogel in aqueous medium. The effect of crosslinker’s difference on the swelling capacity of sorbent were researched by comparing different molecular weight of monomers, and it was found that the molecular structure of organosilane monomers had significant influence on the swelling ability of obtained amphiphilic sorbents. By the use of easy preparations, not needing extra agents for the synthesis, having high and quick absorption abilities in organic solvents showed that the resulting amphiphilic sorbent have potential as absorbents for different organic solvents.

Disposition is one of the crucial decisions which may greatly affect the reverse logistics performance from sustainability perspective. It also plays an important role in improving the operational efficiency of the reverse logistics. The objective of this study is to explore the reverse logistics in context of Indian electronics industry and examine the effect of disposition decisions on Triple Bottom Line (TBL) i.e. economic, environmental, and social performance of reverse logistics. Hypotheses related to disposition decisions and TBL performance was developed. A survey instrument was prepared and was sent to seven hundred organizations from the Indian electronics sector. Over all 208 responses were found suitable for the research. All the necessary statistical analysis was carried out to ensure the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. Partial least square path modelling technique of structural equation modeling has been used for testing the research hypothesis. Measurement model had shown sufficient data fit for the modelling.

Aiming to provide a proficient immobilization carrier for a recombinant xylanase (PersiXyn1), the high-performance 3D copolymeric network of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)-based hydrogel sponges were synthesized using in situ graft radical polymerization. While typical purified gel drying in a vacuum oven made CMC/Acrylate-Hydrogel, the freeze-drying of the resultant swelled Hydrogel containing different amounts of water, resulted in two samples of sponges (i.e., CMC/Acrylate-Sponge1 and CMC/Acrylate-Sponge2). The structural characteristics and water absorbency properties of all the as-prepared samples were evaluated. CMC/Acrylate-Sponge2 was selected for PersiXyn1 immobilization due to its homogeneous porous polymeric skeleton and maximum water absorbency (166.6 g/g) offering superb enzyme immobilization efficiency (100%). Moreover, presence of numerous oxygenated functionalities and cage-like characteristics in the CMC/Acrylate-Sponge2, led to effective electrostatic attractions between support and enzyme providing physically stabilized and reusable bio-conjugates which exhibited up to 60% recovered activity even after eight continuous reuse cycles. The results of kinetic studies indicated that the specific activities of free and immobilized PersiXyn1 were 4157 and 5508 µmol min−1 mg−1, respectively. Interestingly, CMC/Acrylate-Sponge2 support could noticeably broaden the temperature endurance ranges of immobilized PersiXyn1. While free enzyme could preserve only 10% of its maximum activity, the immobilized enzyme maintained 35% of its maximum activity after 60 min incubation at 60 °C. Lastly, CMC/Acrylate-Sponge2 support provided remarkable enzyme protection from denaturing, which caused shifting enzyme unfolding temperature from 71.5 to 78.0 °C, indicating the effectual shielding effects of polymeric support on PersiXyn1. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Enzyme immobilization; Graft polymerization; Hydrogel sponge; PersiXyn1; Thermal stability","Amides; Cellulose; Computer software reusability; Efficiency; Enzyme activity; Grafting (chemical); Hydrogels; Polymerization; Reusability; Stability; Thermodynamic stability; Carboxymethyl cellulose; Electrostatic attractions; Graft polymerization; Immobilization carriers; Immobilization efficiency; PersiXyn1; Poly(acrylic acid-co-acrylamide); Structural characteristics; Enzyme immobilization; Amides; Carboxymethyl Cellulose; Copolymerization; Efficiency; Stability",Article,Scopus

To increase the stability and activity of polymer-based Fenton catalysts, uniform urchin-like α-Fe2O3 was grown in situ in a PVA carrier matrix here. PVA molecules promoted the growth of urchin-like α-Fe2O3, and then the PVA hydrogel acted as a barrier and carrier to reduce agglomeration. Through coordination by hydroxyl groups, PVA had good combination with Fe ions and α-Fe2O3. The formation of Fe–O–C bonds between iron oxides and polymers was reported for the first time, enhancing the material stability during catalysis. Under higher PVA concentrations, the resulting composite hydrogel could generate more ˙OH due to the increase in the number of active sites because of the hairy urchin-like structure. In tetracycline degradation through a heterogeneous Fenton reaction, the resulting material had good catalytic activity from pH 2 to pH 10 with low iron leaching, good reusability and remained at a level of nearly 90% after five consecutive cycles. Density functional theory calculations were used to further prove the mechanism of structural change of the iron oxides. The HOMO and LUMO energies of the iron oxides changed from 5.428 and 4.899 eV to 5.926 and 5.310 eV, indicating that the presence of PVA could influence the charge of the iron atom.

The modification of natural bentonite clay to obtain the adsorbent with high porosity, large surface area, and high adsorption capacity creates a new group of porous and heterostructure materials for immobilization of arsenic species from gold mine wastewater under alkaline condition, owing to the gold cyanidation process. There is a limited approach in alkaline mine wastewater, because of the negative surface charge of most adsorbents. In this research, the adsorbability of arsenic under synthetic and real alkaline wastewater was investigated for the first time. The Visual MINTEQ geochemical modeling software was applied to simulate the arsenic species under different pH, temperature and co-existing ions in mine wastewater obtained from dewatering unit in Zarshuran gold mine. Optimized parameters and better adsorbent were initially determined from synthetic alkaline wastewater, then the efficiency of the adsorption process in real alkaline mine wastewater was measured. In real wastewater treatment, the obtained adsorption efficiency higher than 70% with high reusability in the alkaline condition is an appropriated for only one step process.

Despite being an activity that contributes to these attributes, deciding when applying root canal refactoring is far from trivial. In fact, finding which elements should be refactored is not a cut-and-dried task. One of the main reasons is the lack of consensus on which characteristics indicate the presence of structural degradation. Thus, we evaluated whether the density and diversity of multiple automatically detected symptoms can be used as consistent indicators of the need for root canal refactoring. To achieve our goal, we conducted a multi-case exploratory study involving 6 open source systems and 2 systems from our industry partners. For each system, we identified the classes that were changed through one or more root canal refactorings. After that, we compared refactored and non-refactored classes with respect to the density and diversity of degradation symptoms. We also investigated if the most recurrent combinations of symptoms in refactored classes can be used as strong indicators of structural degradation. Our results show that refactored classes usually present higher density and diversity of symptoms than non-refactored classes. However, root canal refactorings that are performed by developers in practice may not be enough for reducing degradation, since the vast majority had little to no impact on the density and diversity of symptoms. Finally, we observed that symptom combinations in refactored classes are similar to the combinations in non-refactored classes. Based on our findings, we elicited an initial set of requirements for automatically recommending root canal refactorings. © 2019 IEEE.","Code smell; Dependability attributes; Object-oriented design principles; Refactoring; Root canal refactoring; Source code degradation","Computer software reusability; Hydraulic structures; Object oriented programming; Open source software; Open systems; Reusability; Software design; Code smell; Dependability attributes; Object oriented design; Refactorings; Source codes; Software reliability",Conference Paper,Scopus

Structural steel is highly compatible with this concept; however, when steel-concrete composite structures are used, recycling becomes difficult and the potential for reuse is lost. In order to make steel-concrete composite structures reusable, bolted connections should replace the commonly used welded headed studs. Furthermore, the reusable parts should be designed to withstand repeated use. This paper presents a desktop study and the corresponding laboratory experiments on demountable shear connectors that facilitate recyclability and even provide the potential for reusing complete structural elements. In the Laboratory of Steel and Composite Structures of the University of Luxembourg 15 push-out tests have been carried out using different bolted connection systems suitable for multiple use. The shear connectors have been evaluated based on their shear strength, stiffness, slip capacity, ductility and ability of demounting. The investigated systems included pre-stressed and epoxy resin injection bolts, solid slabs and solid slabs in combination with profiled steel sheeting. The results showed that the tested demountable shear connections could provide higher shear resistance than conventional shear connections. The critical failure mode was the shear failure of the bolts, which is a brittle failure. There was no visible damage observed on the connected members. The application of epoxy resin in the hole clearance resulted in lower slip capacity. The outcome provides an important basis for the justification of the forthcoming enhancement and validation of numerical models of the demountable shear connections. The failure behaviour, the observed damages and the resulting ability of the elements for re-use are discussed in detail. © 2019 Institution of Structural Engineers","Circular economy; Demountable shear connectors; Experimental study; Metal decking; Push-out tests; Shear capacity",,Article,Scopus

Two water matrices: isotonic water (IW) and synthetic fresh-cut wastewater (SFCWW) and two bacterial strains (E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enteritidis) have been investigated. The bacterial inactivation rates were compared with other solar processes (solar only, H2O2/solar, Fe3+/solar and Fe3+/H2O2/solar) at neutral pH and at laboratory scale (200 mL) under natural solar radiation. Reagents concentration tested was 0.5, 2.5 and 5 mg L−1 of Fe3+ or Fe3+-EDDHA and 1, 5 and 10 mg L-1 of H2O2. Microbial inactivation kinetics showed an improvement of the solar disinfection efficiency when using Fe3+-EDDHA/solar in comparison with Fe3+/H2O2/solar (conventional photo-Fenton) in both water matrices.

The hydrogels were engineered using the double network strategy to form loosely cross-linked zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine vinylimidazole) (pSBVI) networks into the highly cross-linked cationic poly((trimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate chloride) (pTMAEMA) framework via photopolymerization. The pTMAEMA/pSBVI hydrogel has strong mechanical properties, with a fracture stress 120× higher than single network pTMAEMA hydrogel. In addition, there is inverse correlation between elastic modulus and elastic strain of pTMAEMA/pSBVI hydrogels as a function of ionic strength. The cationic pTMAEMA and zwitterionic pSBVI show opposite swelling behaviors in salt solutions due to the polyelectrolyte effect and antipolyelectrolyte effect. Therefore, the pTMAEMA/pSBVI hydrogel elicits a significant interfacial transition in solutions with different ionic strengths. The IPN hydrogels have switchable lubrication and optical transmittance between deionized water and 1.0 M NaCl solution. The protein adsorption tests further confirmed the switchable interface of salt-responsive IPN hydrogels. In addition, bacterial attachment test on pTMAEMA/pSBVI hydrogels with Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) show bacterial killing rates of the IPN hydrogel over 80% for S. epidermidis and 90% for E. coli after incubating the hydrogels in the bacterial solutions for 24 h. The bacterial release rate from the IPN hydrogel reached 96% after washing with 1.0 M NaCl solution. Furthermore, the excellent reusability of the pTMAEMA/pSBVI hydrogels was demonstrated by the high bacterial killing and bacterial release rates after five kill/release cycles.

Structural work and foundations represent the majority of the embodied energy of a building. The research effort is therefore focused on the structural elements. Reuse is here defined as the reuse of an element without transformation, unlike recycling which induces a new industrial cycle. It is therefore about reducing the consumption of materials and lowering GHG emissions. Today, it is impossible in France to reuse structures because of responsibilities, insurance and lack of traceability. How to make possible the reuse of structural components in order to reach a low carbon building? The challenge of this work is to find the best structural configuration making the components reuse easier at the EOL. The methodology we are implementing aims to design the structural elements by increasing the BIM parameters (6D, LCA), to attach the mechanical information, material durability, ageing to each object of the digital mock-up. A digital and physical traceability makes it possible to follow the evolution of the element over the years and to feed a database. At the end of its life the database is accessible and searchable for the design of a future building. A development of tools and gateways will then allow from a model of calculation to go to query the database to find an element resulting from the deconstruction that can be reused in the future structure. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

In this work, a facile bioinspired method for the versatile fabrication of robust catalytic films is developed. The herein shown approach involves the one-pot synthesis of porous enzyme nanogels decorated with imidazole motifs. These nanogels act as small nanoreactors that are further self-assembled into continuous catalytic nanocoatings through metal-imidazole coordination. An extensive structural, chemical, and functional characterization of the biocatalytic coatings evidences the integrity, stability in organic solvents and high temperatures, and the reusability of the deposits. Moreover, the thickness and metal composition of the nanocoatings can be tuned on demand.

In particular, a flutter suppression system taking advantage of collision within small gaps was proposed and a novel system for the flutter simulation of the whole nonlinear aeroelastic system including the flutter suppression system was developed. First, the critical flutter dynamic pressure of the rudder without the flutter suppression system was calculated with different methods. Then, the whole nonlinear aeroelastic system, including the flutter suppression system, was simulated to design the gap size. Finally, the flutter suppression system was experimentally validated in a hypersonic wind tunnel operating at Mach number 5. The typical phenomenon of Limit Cycle Oscillation (LCO) was observed, avoiding the structural failure of the model and the consistency between numerical and experimental results was demonstrated.

Nickel, copper and iron were employed as doping cations. The as-prepared materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption and UV–vis DRS, EDS and XPS techniques. The TiO2-doped materials were evaluated during the photocatalytic degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP)and naproxen (NPX)sodium as water pollutants under UV radiation. According to the photocatalytic activity and kinetic results, T-Cu 1.0 was the material with the best performance during the degradation of 4-CP, showing a degradation performance of 90% (0.1827 L g−1 min−1)after six reaction hours. T-Fe 1.0 was the photocatalyst with the best NPX degradation behavior, showing a degradation efficiency of 97% (0.1111 L g−1 min−1)also after 6 reaction hours. The photocatalytic degradations followed a pseudo-first-order behavior. The remarkable performance of the photocatalysts was due to a higher concentration of Ti3+ species and the presence of Ni2+, Cu2+ and Fe3+, which worked as TiO2 heterojunctions that allowed the degradation improvement of the organic compounds. The T-Cu 1.0 and T-Fe 1.0 materials were used in a reusability test for 4-CP and NPX compounds, showing around 20 and 30% of final deactivation, respectively. This deactivation was due to structural changes in the TiO2 framework and the oxidation state of the doping cation as a consequence of the constant exposure to UV radiation (18 h)and to the accumulation of carbonaceous species on the TiO2 surface.

This study reported the synthesis of novel three-dimensional rice-like La@MgAl nanocomposites by anchoring La species into Mg-Al LDH matrix to achieve effective and synchronous phosphate and fluoride capture. Results from multiple detection methods including XRD, SEM, FTIR, and XPS revealed the introduced La cations could serve as a structural inducer to regulate the crystallinity of the La@MgAl composites and rice-like nanocomposite La@MgAl-1 was fabricated under optimal La loading amount. La@MgAl-1 possessed high adsorption capacities for both phosphate and fluoride (101.59 mg/g and 51.03 mg/g, respectively). The effective adsorption performance also sustained even after five adsorption-desorption cycles, indicating favorable reusability. The adsorption mechanism analysis revealed that the presence of unique hydrotalcite-like structure triggered memory effect to exert strong adsorption of P and F anions into the interlayered gallery. Besides, an optimum amount of La species organized on the composite wielded specific anion adsorption to phosphate and fluoride through inner-sphere complexation and ligand exchange. These encouraging results highlight the positive consequence of combining the strategic La species and LDH matrix to render a nanostructured Mg/Al/La ternary metal assembly in which various components are united in a controllable way to exert collective properties for accumulative anion adsorption properties.

From the perspective of embodied impacts, repurposing existing structures can reduce the amount of new materials that have to be extracted, manufactured, and installed. While the literature on energy efficiency retrofitting is relatively abundant, a smaller number of studies investigate the differences in whole-building embodied impacts of major renovations. This study presents an approach for conducting a whole-building life cycle assessment (LCA) on building renovation projects, suggests an approach for conducting comparative assessments between renovation and new construction, and demonstrates the approach on an adaptive reuse case study. The approach consists of comparing the full life cycle impacts of the existing building to the sum of the life cycle impacts of the components added in the renovation and the maintenance and replacement needs of the existing/reused components. The case study showed 53–75% reductions across 6 different environmental impact categories when the renovation was compared to a new construction scenario. The reuse of the structural and envelope components provided the majority of the reductions, as most of the renovation was of the interior components and finishes. The presented work can be used as a model for consistent LCAs on other renovation projects and to show designers, policy makers, and building owners the environmental benefits of adaptive reuse over new construction as a result of reduced need for new building materials. © 2019","Life cycle assessment; Refurbishment; Renovation; Retrofit; Reuse","Buildings; Construction; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Retrofitting; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Refurbishment; Renovation; Retrofit; Reuse; Life cycle; building; comparative study; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; refurbishment",Article,Scopus

At present, the commonly used BIW lightweight technology around the world includes the application of high-strength lightweight material, the optimization of vehicle structure as well as application of new molding and connection technology. The optimization of vehicle structure changes the mechanical properties of the components by selecting shape parameters of the components (such as the geometric characteristics of the components), in order to achieve lightweight design or performance optimization design. Since BIW contains a large number of structural components and design variables, designing BIW is always time-consuming and knowledgeable-extensive, which requires the collaboration of multidisciplinary engineers.

The synergistic heterojunction displays excellent photocatalytic performance for the removal of several water-soluble and toxic organic pollutants (50 ppm) under visible light irradiation, with a maximum efficiency of up to 90% (1 h) for tetracycline (TC), 78% (2.5 h) for carbamazepine (CBZ), 100% (10 min) for bisphenol A (BPA) and 100% (30 min) for p-nitrophenol (PNP). Furthermore, the low concentration of phenolic organic pollutants (2 ppm) can also be rapidly degraded into small molecules (analyzed by HPLC) within 10 min.

Since hawthorn kernel has low adsorption capacity, a new hawthorn-based bio-adsorbent having sulphonic acid groups (SHK) was prepared by activation using sulfuric acid with a very simple method. The optimal activation conditions were determined as 6 h, 85 °C, in 18 M sulfuric acid, with a sample/acid ratio of 1/5 (mass/volume). To determine the basic properties such as chemical structure, porosity and surface properties of the HK and SHK, they were characterized by Boehm Titration, BET, FTIR, SEM-EDX, XRD and pHpzc methods. Also, the thermal behavior of both adsorbents was examined by TGA. It was observed that activation has improved the thermal stability and also caused more amorphous structure. Optimum adsorption conditions were determined considering the amount of adsorbent, solution pH, MB initial concentration, and contact time and temperature parameters. Activation significantly changed the surface properties of the HK such as total acidity, functionality, porosity and surface pH. For MB adsorption on both adsorbents, pseudo-second-order kinetic model was found to be appropriate to explain kinetic behavior and equilibrium data fitted better to the Langmuir isotherm model. The maximum MB adsorption capacities of HK and SHK were calculated as 49.5 and 151.5 mg/g, respectively. It was determined from the calculated thermodynamic parameters that the adsorption of MB onto HK is spontaneous at low concentrations and high temperatures, but the adsorption of MB onto SHK is spontaneous at both high concentrations and low temperatures. After reusability studies which were carried out with 100 mg/L MB for five times, the SHK lost about 1% of its removal efficiency. As a result it was observed that SHK could be used as an efficient adsorbent for MB removal from aqueous solutions. © 2019","Activation; Adsorption; Methylene blue; Sulphonated bio-adsorbent","Agricultural wastes; Aromatic compounds; Chemical activation; Dyes; Isotherms; Porosity; Reusability; Structural optimization; Sulfuric acid; Surface properties; Temperature; Activation conditions; Adsorption capacities; Bio-adsorbents; Langmuir isotherm models; Methylene Blue; Pseudo-second-order kinetic models; Temperature parameters; Thermodynamic parameter; Adsorption",Article,Scopus

Therefore, this paper proposes a reusable component identification approach from the source-code of a singular object-oriented software system especially related to multimedia tools. The proposed approach is based on making use of two kinds of dependency relations among different software elements namely structural and lexical relations. These relations, help us to measure cohesion at the component level using two proposed cohesion metrics.

Thus, the need for lithium has continued to escalate. Chemically modified activated carbon (CAC) supported with manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanoparticles was prepared using different manganese salt concentrations (0.1, 0.15, 0.12 and 0.2 M), a facile impregnation approach for enhancing the capacity of activated carbon for Li+ adsorption from aqueous media. The structural, morphological, physico-chemical and elemental properties were characterized by FE-SEM, EDAX, FE-TEM, FTIR, XRD, BET and ICP-OES. A batch experiment was performed to optimize the parameters (pH, adsorbent dose, and contact time) for Li+ adsorption. A kinetic study indicated that lithium sorption process followed a pseudo-second order reaction. Comparative analysis revealed that adsorption capacity of CAC increased with an increase in manganese loading, CAC-Mn0.1, CAC-Mn0.12, CAC-Mn0.15, and CAC-Mn0.2 with qe values of 50.1 mg/g, 65.04 mg/g, 69.93 mg/g and 88.5 mg/g respectively.

Then the residual mechanical properties of steel materials are important indexes to evaluate the postfire performance of the entire structure and the reuse of the steel members. Many studies have been performed to explore the postfire residual performance of different structural steels. However, the observed varying trends and proposed evaluation guidance are too specific and are different from each other. In this paper, existing postfire test data for hot-rolled steels and cold-formed steels are collected from an extensive literature survey. Statistical analyses on the effects of heating experience on the mechanical properties of steels are conducted. The influencing mechanisms are explained from the point of microstructure phase changes during and after the fire heating. The cold-formed steels exhibit a higher level of influence from the fire heating due to the release of cold-working dislocation. Two series of predictive models for postfire residual strength evaluation are calibrated, and they are highly universal and can be easily applied for the residual strength assessment of hot-rolled and cold-formed steels after a fire. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cold-formed steel; Hot-rolled steel; Postfire; Predictive equation; Residual factor","Building materials; Cold working; Fires; Hot rolling; Mechanical properties; Microalloyed steel; Structural design; Studs (structural members); Cold-formed steel; Elevated temperature; Influencing mechanisms; Post-fire; Predictive equations; Residual factors; Residual performance; Structural steels; Hot rolled steel",Review,Scopus

Metal-free photocatalysts have received tremendous attentions due to their environmental friendliness. Meanwhile, morphology and structure of photocatalysts have significant influence on their photocatalytic performance. Herein, we report a metal-free composite photocatalyst of 0-dimensional (0D) graphene quantum dots (GQDs) decorated graphitic carbon nitride nanorods (g-CNNR) that was obtained by a hydrothermal treatment. Characterizations of physicochemical properties demonstrate that this GQDs/g-CNNR photocatalyst has a high crystallization level, enhanced visible light absorption and a staggered band alignment, which can promote the formation, the transportation and the separation of photo-excited electrons and holes. These prominent advantages bring improved photocatalytic activity of the GQDs/g-CNNR for efficient removal of antibiotics. Its photocatalytic reaction rate is 3.46 and 2.03 times higher than those of the pristine graphitic carbon nitride (g-C 3 N 4 ) and the g-CNNR, respectively. Furthermore, this composite photocatalyst has good application universality for decomposing other antibiotics, and also possesses excellent stability and reusability. We further proved that photo-induced holes and superoxide radicals are main active species in the photocatalytic process. Our findings suggest that efficient g-C 3 N 4 based photocatalysts can be well fabricated by structural regulation of g-C 3 N 4 and formation of tightly contacted interface between g-C 3 N 4 and GQDs. © 2019","Graphene quantum dots; Graphitic carbon nitride nanorods; Photocatalysis; Removal of antibiotics; Surface modification","Antibiotics; Graphene; Image enhancement; Light absorption; Morphology; Nanocrystals; Nanorods; Nitrides; Photocatalysis; Photocatalytic activity; Physicochemical properties; Reusability; Semiconductor quantum dots; Surface treatment; Composite photocatalysts; Environmental friendliness; Environmental pollutions; Graphitic carbon nitrides; Morphology and structures; Photocatalytic performance; Photocatalytic reactions; Visible light absorption; Carbon nitride; antibiotic agent; carbon nanoparticle; graphene; nanorod; quantum dot; superoxide; antiinfective agent; cyanogen; graphite; nanocomposite; nanotube; nitrile; quantum dot; absorption; Article; chemical structure; crystallization; degradation; diffraction; light; photocatalysis; physical chemistry; priority journal; catalysis; chemistry; photochemistry; water pollutant; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Catalysis; Graphite; Light; Nanocomposites; Nanotubes; Nitriles; Photochemical Processes; Quantum Dots; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,Scopus

The effects of polycondensation temperature on the structure and photocatalytic performance of mpg-C3N4 in NO photo-oxidation were studied. The results revealed that polycondensation temperature has a dramatic effect on the photocatalytic activity of mpg-C3N4 in NO photo-oxidation, where mpg-C3N4 synthesized at 500 ℃ (mpg-CN500) showed the best performance in NOx abatement as well as a high selectivity towards solid state NOx storage under VIS light illumination.

Results revealed that cadmium adsorption decreased by increasing biochar dosage from 0.5 to 8 g/L; however, optimum dosage for maximum (99%) removal of cadmium was 2 g/L by WSB and 1 g/L by AWSB. Enhanced cadmium removal potential by AWSB is attributed to increased surface area, microporosity and variation in functional groups.

In a circular economy, the reuse of building components in multiple life cycles aims at increasing resource efficiency and eliminating waste. But can reuse offset the environmental impacts of materials with high embodied energy (e.g. steel)? If so, in what conditions? In the study presented in this paper, the authors used two different life cycle assessment (LCA) methods to compare a single-use wood-framed wall against a reusable steel-framed wall in a tiny house in the U.S. The analyzed impact categories were global warming potential, embodied energy, and water use. One of the main goals of this study was to understand the benefits of reusing a material with high embodied energy when compared to a single-use alternative. Another equally important objective was to understand how different LCA methods can influence the results in a cradle-to-cradle (C2C) LCA. As results, reuse benefits depended on aggressive reuse rates (>70%) and multiple reuses of steel were needed to offset the embodied environmental impacts during steel production. Also, the analyses showed that process-based LCA and hybrid LCA can generate conflicting results in a C2C LCA. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building materials; Circular economy; cradle-to-cradle; Deconstruction; Recycling; Reuse","Building materials; Construction industry; Environmental impact; Global warming; Recycling; Steelmaking; Walls (structural partitions); Circular economy; Comparative life cycle assessment; Cradle to cradles; Deconstruction; Embodied environmental impact; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Reuse; Life cycle; steel; water; comparative study; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; recycling; Article; comparative study; energy; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; household; life cycle assessment; priority journal; recycling; United States; water management; wood; environment; greenhouse effect; United States; Environment; Global Warming",Article,Scopus

A baseline of the current state of the art in adaptability evaluation and adaptation decision support is established; from this baseline, gaps for future research are recommended. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review was conducted to identify papers describing adaptability models and tools. The identified models were characterized based on their focus (new buildings, existing buildings, building life cycle), considered variables (physical and/or context features) and degree/type of validation. Findings: Models can be grouped as those focusing on: evaluating adaptation decisions for existing buildings; the design of new buildings for future adaptation; and understanding adaptation throughout a building life cycle. Models focusing on existing building evaluation are further in development and validation than the other model types; as such, they are more suitable for use by practitioners. Another finding is that modeling of adaptability in buildings is still in its nascent stage and that data-driven quantitative modeling is a prime area for future research. Originality/value: This paper is the first comprehensive review of models and tools for evaluating adaptability. Other works have evaluated the topic of adaptability more broadly, but this is the first paper to systematically characterize existing models and tools.

It is not completely metabolized after administration where 52% is excreted in urine. Accordingly, it highly contributes in generating wastewater containing MF. This pollutant is not effectively removed by the conventional wastewater treatment methods. Therefore, an effective advanced treatment technique should be implemented for the removal of MF from wastewater. In this study, silica-alumina (SA) is used as an environmentally-safe and effective adsorbent for removing MF from aqueous solution by adsorption. Adsorption experiments were employed studying the effect of pH, contact time, and MF initial concentration to investigate both the removal efficiency of MF and the interaction mechanism. A set of characterization techniques, such as SEM, BET, FTIR, TPD-MS, and zeta potential were performed before and after adsorption experiments to confirm the role of structural morphology, surface area, porosity, surface acidity and charge in adsorption. The characterization analysis showed that SA has BET surface area of 470 m2/g. From the total BET surface area, the microporous surface area was around 31% (147 m2/g), while the rest corresponds to the mesoporous surface area (323 m2/g). The batch adsorption results showed that high concentrations of MF were efficiently removed from water samples with a maximum uptake of 46 mg/L at optimal pH 9.0 (optimal pH). The mechanism responsible for adsorption was observed to be carried out via an electrostatic interaction between a negatively charged SA and a positively charged MF. TGA/DT analysis was conducted to assess the reusability of the spent SA by thermal regeneration at 673 K. The adsorbent was completely regenerated and maintained a 95% removal after 3 cycles without impacting the surface characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.","Adsorption; Film and pore diffusion; Metformin; Silica-alumina; Sips model; Thermal regeneration","Adsorption; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Reusability; Silica; Wastewater treatment; Characterization techniques; Interaction mechanisms; Metformins; Pharmaceutical compounds; Pore diffusion; Silica-alumina; Surface characteristics; Thermal regeneration; Morphology",Article,Scopus

Herein, based on the pre-pressed melamine foam (MF), we have fabricated a scalable, low cost, and durable bilayer polymer foam for efficient and stable solar steam generation. Making use of the bilayer structure, different functions are assigned to different layers, with polypyrrole (PPy) coating pre-pressed MF (PPy layer) for light absorption and water evaporation, and bottom pre-pressed MF layer for water transport and thermal insulation. A high average evaporation rate of 1.574 kg m −2 h −1 and a superb steam generation efficiency of 90.4% under 1 sun are achieved. Bilayer foam demonstrates remarkable robustness and stability under a series of severe conditions. Bilayer foam can keep its structural stability and evaporation performance in durability tests (over 30 days, with 60 min each day), exhibiting the long-term durability, excellent antifouling property, and good reusability. We have also demonstrated the potential practicability of two simple prototype devices for solar steam generation on land and water.

In this study, a facile spray-coating method is employed for fabrication of a TiO2-coated filter, with fibrous structure allowing for satisfactory airflow, sufficient pollutant-catalyst interactions, and reusability. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that TiO2 nanoparticles were immobilized firmly on the surface of the membrane's fibers.

The photocatalytic oxidations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) are analyzed in both the laboratory and field tests. TiO2-coated PWS filter membrane (60×60×5 cm) shows higher benzene and toluene removal efficiency (approximately 80%-86%) under UV radiation than that in the dark (less than 10%). This result indicates that photocatalytic oxidation on the surface of TiO2-coated PWS filter membrane contributes greatly to benzene and toluene degradation.

There are number of studies that have been conducted on concrete with rubber as aggregate in order to maintain mechanical properties and durability of material. Contrary, only several studies have been conducted on usage of waste rubber tires as aggregate in reinforced concrete elements and systems. These review paper summaries and compare independent research works and justifies weather these aggregates are possible to utilize improved behavior of concrete elements or not. According to general conclusions on fundamental properties of rubberized elements it is evident that the waste rubber tire aggregates can be used as partial replacement of both coarse aggregates and fine aggregates. Previous research on structural elements shows that replacement of the natural aggregate with recycled tire aggregate in concrete, will produce structural elements with improved behavior: increased capacity for deformations (ductility), better dissipation of energy, and higher damping, in comparison with standard concrete made with conventional aggregates. However, the increased content of rubber in concrete also has negative effects, for example reduction of compressive and tensile as well as reduction of Young's modulus of elasticity. The results of these experimental studies are not sufficient to reach a general consensus on the application of recycled rubber in concrete and its effect on the behavior of structural elements.

However, the implementation of life cycle thinking (and its operational counterpart the circular economy) in combination with an objective sustainability evaluation is still in its infancy. Therefore, the aim of this study is twofold. First, it is illustrative for the quantified assessment of the potential environmental and financial benefits and burdens of introducing circular design alternatives for internal wall assemblies to the Belgian market. Second, it reviews the methodological implications on the results of a consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) and a life cycle costing (LCC), acknowledging the time dependence and closed-loop nature of those circular design alternatives. That aim is achieved through a multi-model set-up. Evaluating the design alternatives through various methodological assumptions and service life models, allows understanding the relevance and robustness of the results by acknowledging the corresponding uncertainty. In total seven alternative wall assemblies are assessed over a period of 60 years, with a refurbishment every 15 year. The results, without considering the impact of biogenic CO 2 nor the influence of thermal mass, show that a low life cycle impact can be achieved for assemblies that are designed to be used again and have a higher initial impact, such as a plywood boarding connected in a reversible way to demountable metal frame substructure, as well as for assemblies with no possibilities for direct reuse that have a low initial impact, such as a drywall system with a wooden substructure. In addition to the environmental assessment, the life cycle cost of the demountable and reusable wall assemblies with a metal substructure is 10 and 17% lower than that of the conventional alternative with the lowest life cycle cost. Further, regarding the methodological scenarios on marginal supplier identification in the consequential LCA, the range of possible outcomes is however much larger for the demountable wall assemblies than for the conventional ones. For the conventional wall assemblies there is only a small divergence in results of around 10% between the scenarios, while for the demountable ones this deviation rises to 25%. Altogether, this case study points out the potential benefits of introducing demountable and reusable walls, but highlights at the same time the need for a comprehensive sustainability assessment before responsible conclusions can be drawn. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Circular economy; Construction sector; Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costing; Uncertainty","Construction industry; Costs; Ecodesign; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Structural design; Sustainable development; Walls (structural partitions); Circular economy; Construction sectors; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle costing; Uncertainty; Life cycle",Article,Scopus

In the present study, for the first time, a reusable monolithic 3D porous adsorbing filter was fabricated by integrating 3D printing technique with a natural adsorbent (chitosan), which is a low-cost and highly effective solution for heavy metal removal. The –NH 2 and –OH functional groups found on the highly porous monoliths were capable of adsorbing metal ions. Further analyses revealed that the adsorption capacity increases with the filter’s surface area, with T = 25 °C and pH 5.5 representing the optimal working conditions. The maximum adsorption capacity of 13.7 mg/g (calculated by using the total mass) was measured for the filter with skewed hexagonal holes. The pseudo-first-order equation and Langmuir isotherm model presented a good fit to the experimental data, thus accurately describing the adsorption kinetics and the adsorption equilibrium. The monolithic chitosan-loaded filter exhibited a superior adsorption kinetics of 2.2 mg/(g min) for Cu(II) removal. Findings yielded by the desorption experiment also demonstrated that EDTA can desorb the metal ions from the monoliths, and its ~ 92% desorption capacity indicates high reusability.

Therefore, a cooling batch foaming method was designed to fabricate the high-expansion PP foams using supercritical CO 2 as a blowing agent. To investigate the relation between the crystallization and foaming of PP, an in-situ visualization system was employed. It is found that the CO 2 dissolved in polymer melt depresses the crystallization temperature and nucleation of PP. When the foaming is triggered before the crystallization, high-expansion foams can be prepared. Moreover, foaming occurring before crystallization helps to produce an open-cell structure owing to a structural inhomogeneity induced by the PP crystallization. According to the hydrophobicity and oil absorption capacity tests, the open-cell foam prepared at 20 MPa and 135 °C exhibits a large water contact angle of 151.5° and a high adsorption capacity of 48.9 g/g for carbon tetrachloride.

The best degradation of 4–NP was exhibited in ZnO MNPS with 30% Fe3O4 content. On the other hand, the best photocatalytic activity was exhibited by ZnO MNPs prepared by 30 min microwave reaction time. The morphology was independent of microwave reaction time, while agglomerates of the ZnO MNPs were observed with increasing microwave reaction time up to 60 min. The study comprehensively discovered that the ZnO MNPs prepared with 20% Fe3O4 content and 30 min microwave reaction time exhibited enhanced degradation of 4–NP up to 99% within 120 min. As a conclusion, Fe3O4 content and microwave reaction time played an important role in the structural fabrication, photodegradation properties and reusability of ZnO MNPs. The current study could be deemed of great potential for the preparation and applications of ZnO MNPs in environmental remediation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","4–nitrophenol; Fe3O4 content; Fe3O4/ZnO magnetic nanoparticles; Microwave reaction time; Photocatalytic degradation","Field emission microscopes; Fourier series; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Iron oxides; Light absorption; Magnetite; Microwaves; Morphology; Oxide minerals; Phenols; Photocatalytic activity; Reusability; Saturation magnetization; Scanning electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc oxide; Characterization techniques; Environmental remediation; Fe3O4 content; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Microwave reactions; Nitrophenols; Photo catalytic degradation; Vibrating sample magnetometer; Magnetic nanoparticles",Article,Scopus

The morphological, structural and thermal properties of amphiphilic polymeric sorbents were determined by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, 13 C and 29 Si CPMAS nuclear magnetic resonance, scanning electron microscope and thermal gravimetric analysis. Having hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions in the polymeric structure, the obtained sorbents have affinity toward both water and organic liquids. The effect of molecular weight of monomers on absorption ability was examined via swelling test. The swelling ability in binary mixtures was also studied to determine the absorption capacity of polymers in organic solvent–water mixtures.

Tests were conducted for clamping force, static shear strength, static tensile strength, and shear fatigue life for collars subjected to five collar replacements. The static shear results showed no decrease in the ultimate shear strength of the fastener pin as a function of collar replacement. Static tensile results showed no decrease in the ultimate tensile strength of the fastener as a function of collar replacement, with failure of the aluminum collar remaining the critical failure mode. Similarly, shear fatigue results showed no decrease in the shear fatigue life of the fastened joint as a result of collar replacement, with fracture of the aluminum substrate remaining the critical failure mode.

Still little explored, the reuse of structural components over multiple service lives has the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of building structures. Structural design and construction based on reuse avoids sourcing new material, it reduces superfluous waste, and requires little energy. However, designing a structure from a stock of reclaimed elements entails a change of design paradigm: in contrast to conventional design practice, the structural geometry and topology depends on element stock characteristics, e.g. available cross sections and lengths. This paper presents discrete structural optimization formulations to design truss systems from stock elements. The approach taken in this work is iterative: 1) element assignment and topology optimization are carried out, and 2) geometry optimization follows thereafter to best-fit the system geometry to the length of assigned stock elements, for instance to reduce cut-off waste. Two case studies are presented: a) a cantilever of simple layout used to explain the details of the design methodology, and b) a train station roof structure of complex layout made from elements reused from disassembled electric pylons. For these case studies, Life Cycle Assessment confirms that an up to 63% environmental impact reduction is possible when comparing structures obtained with the proposed method against weight-optimized solutions made of new elements. © 2018 The Authors","Circular economy; Life-Cycle Assessment; Reuse; Structural optimization; Truss structures",,Article,Scopus

Dip-catalyst is accentuated by its highly convenient deployment, easy separation and great recyclability. Polymeric film- or paper-based dip-catalyis has problems of low catalytic efficiency and MNP leaching or aggregation. Bacterial cellulose (BC) with its naturally nano-porous surface structure can efficiently support and stabilize the MNPs. Further compositing with plant fibers, the economy, catalytic efficiency and mechanical stiffness of the dip-catalyst may be greatly improved. However, the aqueous phase recyclability of the cellulosic fiber-based dip-catalyst is still limited, impairing its broad application. In this study, polyethylenimine (PEI) was used to crosslink BC-fiber and fiber–fiber within the BC-fiber matrix to improve the wet strength of the dip-catalyst. In detail, plant fibers were composited with the Au NP-embedded BC to fabricate a dip-catalyst through the paper handsheet making method. During the process, PEI was added as a wet-strength agent. The catalytic activity of this dip-catalyst was evaluated on the reduction of 4-nitrophenol in water by using NaBH 4 . Adding 1% PEI reduced the turnover frequency of 10% Au-BC sheet from 131.9 to 53.7 h −1 , but greatly improved its recyclability and reusability. After reused for 30 times, reaction rate and yield was well maintained without impaired for the Au-BC catalytic sheets with PEI additions. This study promotes much broader applications for the BC-fiber dip-catalyst in chemical reactions.

In this study, the synthesis of a β-cyclodextrin-based submicron polymeric particles (CSPs) is described along with its utilization as adsorbent for the remediation of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) from aqueous solution. Morphology and structural characterization illustrated the microstructure evolution of the aggregated CSPs with different catalytic doses. Using CSPs obtained under optimum conditions as sorbent, the adsorption performance for 2,4-DCP was systematically studied. The adsorption process fitted well the pseudo-second-order model and the Freundlich model, and thermodynamic studies manifested that the adsorption was a spontaneous and exothermic process. The slightly acidic and neutral pH as well as inorganic ions co-existence were found to be favorable for adsorption of 2,4-DCP onto CSPs. Further, CSPs had superior affinity for 2,4-DCP from aqueous media containing other analogues (2-chlorophenol and phenol). The comprehensive analysis of experimental and theoretical results suggested that the π–π hydrophobic, and hydrogen bonding interactions may jointly drive the uptake process of 2,4-DCP. Thus, CSPs even with low surface-area showed high adsorption capacity for 2,4-DCP compared with activated carbon and other adsorbents. Also, CSPs displayed excellent structural stability and reversibility after 5 cycles of adsorption experiments.

However, the slow kinetics of CO 2 capture on unmodified Na 2 CO 3 make it an unacceptable choice for practical applications. If the reaction kinetics could be dramatically improved, then Na 2 CO 3 could be a viable material for large-scale carbon capture applications. The first step to systematic improvement of kinetics is to understand the rate-limiting steps in the uncatalyzed system. We have therefore investigated the structural, mechanistic, and energetic properties of CO 2 capture on the (001) and (-402) surfaces of Na 2 CO 3 using density functional theory to identify the origin of the slow kinetics observed in experiments. We have identified reaction pathways for co-adsorbed CO 2 and H 2 O that lead to bicarbonate formation on the (001) and (-402) surfaces having activation energies of 0.40 and 0.34 eV, respectively. We modeled surface carbonation reactions under conditions of high surface loading of water by performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at typical operating temperatures. Multiple reactions were observed on picosecond time scales. Our results indicate that the Na 2 CO 3 carbonation reaction is not controlled by the kinetics of the reaction at the surface but is likely by diffusion limitations. We propose two possible scenarios that could result in diffusion control of the reaction rate. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","ab initio molecular dynamics; CO 2 capture; density functional theory; sodium carbonate; surface carbonation barrier","Activation energy; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Density functional theory; Kinetics; Lead compounds; Molecular dynamics; Reaction kinetics; Reusability; Sodium Carbonate; Surface reactions; Temperature; Ab initio molecular dynamics; Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation; Carbonation reactions; CO2 capture; Diffusion limitations; Energetic properties; Operating temperature; Picosecond time scale; Sodium compounds",Article,Scopus

The combination of structural and substrate specificity data provided valuable information for immobilization studies. Dimeric TtAPRT2 was immobilized onto glutaraldehyde-activated MagReSyn®Amine magnetic iron oxide porous microparticles by two different strategies: a) an enzyme immobilization at pH 8.5 to encourage the immobilization process by N-termini (MTtAPRT2A, MTtAPRT2B, MTtAPRT2C) or b) an enzyme immobilization at pH 10.0 to encourage the immobilization process through surface exposed lysine residues (MTtAPRT2D, MTtAPRT2E, MTtAPRT2F). According to catalyst load experiments, MTtAPRT2B (activity: 480 IU g−1biocatalyst, activity recovery: 52%) and MTtAPRT2F (activity: 507 IU g−1biocatalyst, activity recovery: 44%) were chosen as optimal derivatives. The biochemical characterization studies demonstrated that immobilization process improved the thermostability of TtAPRT2.

CS-EDTA-mGO nanobiocomposite was characterized by XRD, FTIR, VSM, TGA, and zeta potential. Further, the morphological features of the synthesized graphene oxide and mGO were examined by SEM technique. The adsorption conditions were designed and optimized by experimental design applied by faced-central composite design. CS-EDTA-mGO indicated high sorption capacity where the R% of 92% was obtained under optimal conditions (sorbent dosage = 0.14 g L−1; dye concentration = 114 mg L−1; pH = 7.5; temperature = 33 °C). The result of kinetics studies revealed that the adsorption was considerably fast and the data followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The adsorption equilibrium of the cationic dye by CS-EDTA-mGO showed that the Langmuir model fitted the experimental data significantly and the maximum adsorption capacity estimated from Langmuir model was 1085.3 mg g−1, which was highly consistent with the maximum experimental adsorption capacity. The thermodynamic parameters represented that the interaction in the adsorption process was endothermic and the randomness at the solid/solution interface increased during the process.

In this paper, an environmentally friendly, low cost, self-cleaning, highly stable and multifunctional TiO2 enhanced Sodium alginate composite (SAT) aerogel for oil-water separation is developed via a simple combined ionic cross-linking and freeze drying method. The morphological, structural and surface chemical properties of the as-prepared SAT aerogels is characterized by scanning electric microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Flourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The characterizations demonstrate that the SAT aerogel is of three-dimensional porous microstructure with uniformly dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) on alginate matrix. The hydrophilic alginate matrix combined with this unique morphostructure will ensure the SAT aerogels with underwater oleophobicity and subsequent excellent oil/water separation efficiency (up to 99.7%). Moreover, the firmly attached TiO2 NPs can also endow the aerogel with better UV-aging resistance, photoinduced self-cleaning and environmental remediation performance. The SAT aerogel exhibits better oil/water separation reusability (at least 60 cycles) compared to SA aerogel and excellent photocatalytic performance for methyl orange (MO) degradation (&gt;85% after 6 times repeated use). The “green” facile fabrication process, excellent oil/water separation, photoinduced self-cleaning and reusable performances make the SAT aerogel promising for practical application in aquatic environments.

The composites have produced 100% MNZ removal (10 mg L−1) within 120 min at a catalyst loading of 0.3 g L−1. However, a maximum TOC removal of 76.1% and 63.7% was observed in PVA-CS-TiO2 and CS-TiO2 systems, respectively. In comparison, complete MNZ removal in suspended TiO2 system was observed at 8.3 times higher dosage under similar conditions. The stability of the composites in water and adsorption mechanism was modelled through density functional theory (DFT). The energy of formation for CS-TiO2, PVA-TiO2 and PVA-CS in water were found to be −0.144, −0.153 and −0.220 eV, respectively. It was inferred that the presence of CS significantly enhanced MNZ adsorption and moreover, the removal was due to synergetic removal by adsorption (pseudo-second-order) and photocatalysis (pseudo-first-order) as evidenced via kinetic models. The hierarchy of adsorption capability of different adsorbents towards MNZ is as follows: PVA-CS-TiO2 &gt; CS-TiO2 &gt; CS &gt; TiO2 &gt; PVA. The prepared composites showed consistent MNZ removal rates and structural integrity over 15 photocatalytic treatment cycles. Moreover, a kinetic model was developed to identify a best combination of retention time and TiO2 content in PVA-CS-TiO2 to predict 100% MNZ. Overall, MNZ removal along with enthalpy values indicated that the prepared composites could be applied for pharmaceutical removal on a long-term basis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Chitosan-based TiO2 composites; DFT modelling; Reusability studies; UV/TiO2 photocatalysis","Adsorption; Batch reactors; Chitosan; Computer software reusability; Density functional theory; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Photocatalysis; Precipitation (chemical); Reinforced plastics; Reusability; Adsorption capability; Adsorption mechanism; Catalyst loadings; Photo-catalytic removal; Photocatalytic treatment; Polymeric composites; Pseudo second order; Pseudo-first-order; Titanium dioxide",Article,Scopus

This brings in a need to design molecular scaffolds suitable for efficient adsorption of the contaminants present in water. In this paper, an unprecedented strategy is demonstrated in order to synthesize highly porous bovine serum albumin-Au (BSA-Au) beads and was employed for the removal of water contaminants. The beads stored in acidic medium (Bead a ) and in basic medium (Bead b ) selectively adsorb anionic and cationic species that includes organic dyes and inorganic species, respectively, by showing a pH-responsive behavior. This phenomenon bestowed the beads with the recyclability and reusability as demonstrated for eight cycles wherein almost 100% efficiency is retained by the beads without any deterioration. The porous nature of these beads is retained even after switching the pH for several cycles of adsorption-desorption processes as judged based by the SEM data. Thus, the reported beads are demonstrated for their selective and efficient removal of both organic and inorganic contaminants from water wherein the beads can be recycled by triggering pH changes that would also release the captured species.

The Metropole Region of Amsterdam (MRA) is a pioneer in this field, initiating a research for circular rebuilding of a neighbourhood in 2016 and the development of a roadmap for circular urban development in 2017. This year, the port of Amsterdam and the municipalities of Amsterdam and Haarlemmermeer together commissioned the analysis of the effects of circular construction on material flows, transport movements in the MRA, and land use in the harbour area. These effects were analysed by means of a building material model (BOB), combined with logistic models and construction and demolition forecasts of the Economic Institute for Construction and Housing (EIB). The results showed a mismatch between the supply of secondary building materials and the construction demand, ranging from factor 7 (more demand than supply) in the coming years to a factor 4 in the period 2041-2050. An evaluation of circular construction concepts revealed high potential for the reuse of structural elements, leading to a 20% decrease of material need for new buildings, 21% less transport kilometres and 20% less land use. The concept of demountable constructions was calculated to have no impact on total material use between 2018-2050, while increasing the transport kilometres and land use. Several concrete recommendations were given, for example on the interaction between logistics and land use and need for a more in-depth comparison of a variety of circular strategies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Buildings; Concretes; Land use; Ports and harbors; Urban growth; Circular strategies; Construction and demolition; Construction demands; High potential; Logistic models; Material Flow; Structural elements; Urban development; Construction",Conference Paper,Scopus

In the last decades, the sustainability of steel grew and turned from a linear to a circular business, where the material is fully recovered and recycled after use. The RFCS Research Project ""REDUCE"" of the European Commission goes one step beyond the mere material recycling and investigates, how the circular economy's philosophy can be used to reduce the carbon footprint furthermore. On that basis, one target of the research was to develop basic modular and standardised structural load bearing elements which can be adapted in the building or assembled, properly disassembled and partly or entirely be reused again in a subsequent building. This paper presents the respective research results of demountable flooring- and beam systems: 15 large scale push-out tests and two large scale composite beam tests as well as numerous finite element simulations with ABAQUS have been performed at the Laboratory of the ArcelorMittal Chair of Steel and Faade Engineering.

The investigated systems included pre-stressed and epoxy injected systems, as well as solid slabs and composite slabs with profiled decking. The results showed sometimes higher resistances and smaller displacement capacities than conventional systems.

Still, they contribute the most to the material weight and embodied impacts of buildings and infrastructures. The reuse of structural components therefore offers great potential to save materials, energy and resources. While historic and contemporary projects highlight the environmental, time or cost benefits of building with reclaimed elements, many technological challenges remain. This paper gives an overview of buildings that efficiently reuse structural components as well as a review of current research efforts addressing structural reuse. The first case study is the design process of an elastic gridshell made from reclaimed skis. This project demonstrates the potential of ensuring structural performance while working with uncharacterized and heterogeneous materials. In general, designing structures from a stock of reclaimed elements entails reversing the conventional structural design process. The synthesis of structures has to follow the availability of elements and their mechanical and geometric properties. Developed tools that facilitate such design from reused elements while minimizing embodied environmental impacts are presented in this paper. A second case study demonstrates the relevance of such tools through a conceptual train station roof made from electric pylon elements. Lastly, some key challenges related to the design of structural systems from reused elements are presented. These research initiatives constitute a first step to understand and support the design of load-bearing systems from reused elements and hence to bring the construction industry closer to circular economy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Availability; Buildings; Construction industry; Electric tools; Environmental impact; Inflatable structures; Obsolescence; Reclamation; Embodied environmental impact; Geometric properties; Heterogeneous materials; Load-bearing components; Research initiatives; Structural component; Structural performance; Technological challenges; Structural analysis",Conference Paper,Scopus

Renovation, layout modifications, and other physical changes are usually complicated processes associated with losses in materials and assets. The building industry is responsible for a vast amount of the global waste. Therefore a shift towards circular solutions is crucial to minimise this negative environmental impact. This paper is based on the master thesis, A Tale of Layers, completed in spring 2018 at Chalmers University of Technology, and provides further discussion on the results. The thesis developed a set of design strategies for adaptable skin systems, and focused on a design proposal of 'the connection' which is a reversible connection system between the structure and the skin of a building. The aim of 'the connection' is to increase the building's adaptability and the circular use of materials. It allows transformations in the skin with minimal effects on the structural system to preserve its quality and value. The design strategies and 'the connection' can be applied in different contexts, while the skin systems alternatives presented are specific for the extension of Snckeback School in Ronneby, Sweden. Separating the different building systems and following standard dimensions and modular systems make buildings easy to repair and adjust according to the changing demands and increase the possibility for materials reuse. However, they can limit the buildings' shape and form. Creating skins with variable U-values is an additional benefit of separation, allowing the skin to be one factor that contributes to optimising the building energy performance in some climates. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Construction industry; Environmental impact; Maintenance; Building energy performance; Building industry; Building systems; Chalmers University of Technology; Circular solution; Design strategies; Layout modification; Structural systems; Buildings",Conference Paper,Scopus

This paper investigates how current calculation practice of building LCA from the EN 15804/15978 standards affects the global warming potential (GWP) of building designs where material loops have been in focus. In this study, we calculate the environmental potentials of circular building design based on two cases; 1) a building constructed from primarily upcycled materials, and 2) a building constructed with principles of design for disassembly (DfD). Results from the two cases point to the significance of the EN standards' allocation approach in which a system's use of recycling/reuse is merited, rather than meriting a system providing recyclable/reusable materials. Hence, the upcycling strategy results in lower GWP, especially from the production stage, whereas the DfD strategy does not realize an environmental advantage within the framework of the EN standards. Results further shows that even though concrete elements are notable components of the DfD building, developing DfD-solutions for these exact elements might not be the preferred focus for optimizing the environmental benefits provided by the building. Instead, DfD focus could be on shorter-lived elements of high benefit potentials. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architectural design; Ecodesign; Global warming; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Allocation approach; Circular designs; Circular economy; Concrete elements; Environmental benefits; Environmental sustainability; Global warming potential; Production stage; Structural design",Conference Paper,Scopus

Traditionally, composite beams are cast in-situ and shear interaction between the concrete and steel beam is provided by welded headed studs. The application of welded headed studs prevents the non-destructive separation of the composite beam, which leads to a very low scoring in the sustainable assessment in terms of the reuse of structural components. An alternative to welded headed studs are bolted shear connectors, which allow for demountability and reusability of a (prefabricated) composite floor system. A key challenge for demountable and reusable composite beams consisting of prefabricated elements is to provide sufficient tolerances to allow for easy execution and demounting, but also to achieve a stiff and strong shear connection under live loads. The required tolerances can, for instance, be obtained by using large bolt-to-hole clearances. The, at first glance, contradictory requirement of a large hole clearance in the execution phase and high stiffness under live loading conditions was solved by using injection bolts. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the demountable and composite structures fit in the circular economy framework, and to show that such a demountable and reusable structure was successfully erected and demounted under laboratory conditions. In addition, a cost assessment will be addressed using a simple methodology based on estimated service life (ESL) factors to estimate the annual environmental costs of a composite floor system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bolts; Composite beams and girders; Computer software reusability; Concretes; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Fits and tolerances; Floors; Reusability; Steel beams and girders; Studs (structural members); Tall buildings; Welding; Composite floor systems; Design of composites; Environmental costs; Laboratory conditions; Multi-storey car park; Prefabricated elements; Structural component; Sustainable assessment; Studs (fasteners)",Conference Paper,Scopus

In this research, a new FeNi3/SiO2/CuS magnetic nanocomposite was first synthesized and its physical and structural characteristics were analyzed using FESEM, TEM, FTIR, XRD, VSM, and TGA techniques. To determine the thermodynamic parameters, the equilibrium isotherms, and adsorption process kinetics, the effect of parameters including pH (3–11), contact time (5–180 min), initial concentration of pollutant (10–30 mg/L), nanocomposite dose (0.005–0.1 g/L), and temperature (50-5 °C) were studied. Finally, the residual metronidazole concentration was determined using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer T80+ at a wavelength of 320 nm. The results related to the physical properties of the synthesized magnetic nanocomposite indicated that the particle size lied within the range of 20–65 nm and the structure of this new nano-absorbent was amorphous. Also, the FeNi3/SiO2/CuS nanocomposite had a good magnetism and its magnetic saturation was 18.42 emu/gr. Considering the efficiency of the newly synthesized nanocomposites in metronidazole absorption, the highest percentage of the pollutant adsorption was observed at pH = 7, contact time = 180 min, nanocomposite dose = 0.1 g/L, and temperature = 20 °C. With the increase in the synthesized nano-absorbent dose, the absorption percentage increased significantly (from 24.18 to 62.18). Similarly, with in the growth of the initial concentration of metronidazole from 10 to 30 mg/L, the absorption percentage declined from 85.26 to 44.6% due to the restriction of the absorption sites. Notably, as the temperature rose, the absorption percentage increased (from 37.73% to 65.15%), suggesting that the adsorption reaction was endothermic. The data obtained from Langmuir (R2 = 0.9991) and Freundlich (R2 = 0.8148) equilibrium isotherms revealed that the metronidazole absorption process through the synthesized magnetic nanocomposite was consistent with the Langmuir model. Also, the data obtained from the reaction kinetic calculations showed that the absorption of metronidazole by the adsorbent was described in accordance with a pseudo-second-order model. According to the results of the thermodynamic studies including the entropy changes (ΔS) (82.12% J/mol k), the enthalpy changes (ΔH) (0.056 kJ/mol) and the Gibbs negative free energy (ΔG), it could be concluded that the adsorption process was endothermic. In this study, the efficiency and the reusability of the synthesized magnetic nanoadsorbent were examined in the removal of metronidazole. The findings indicated that following five adsorption – desorption cycles, the efficiency of the nanoadsorbent in the removal process have a slight decrease. Regarding the results of this study, it is suggested that the magnetic nanocomposite (FeNi3/SiO2/CuS) can be a suitable new absorbent for absorption of metronidazole antibiotic from aqueous solutions. The reason is that in addition to its excellent efficiency, it can be separated from an in-vitro setting by an external magnetic field due to its great magnetic properties. © 2018","Adsorption; Isotherm; Kinetics; Magnetic nanocomposite; Metronidazole; Thermodynamic","Absorption; Adsorption; Adsorption isotherms; Antibiotics; Enzyme kinetics; Free energy; Isotherms; Kinetics; Nanocomposites; Particle size; Pollution; Reaction kinetics; Reusability; Solutions; Temperature; Thermodynamics; External magnetic field; Initial concentration; Kinetic and thermodynamic studies; Magnetic nanocomposites; Metronidazole; Pseudo-second order model; Structural characteristics; Thermodynamic parameter; Magnetism",Article,Scopus

Reusing structural elements reduces the environmental impacts of building structures because it avoids sourcing new material, it reduces waste and it requires little energy. Designing structures from reused elements is unlike conventional structural design because stock element availability is a design input. In other words, structures must be designed to fit given element characteristics, e.g. cross-sections and lengths. Stock constraints such as number of elements and element lengths, have a major influence on the optimal structure layout and form. In this new paradigm structural form follows availability. This work formulates new computational methods for the synthesis of reticular structures through reuse. Two scenarios are presented: a) reuse of reclaimed elements from a given stock, and b) design of a common stock which is used as a kit-of-parts to build diverse structures. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methods. It is shown that structures produced by these methods have a significantly lower environmental impact than minimum weight structures made of new elements. Copyright © 2019 by S: GABRIELE, F.

The inclusion of construction constraints within the digital design process enable novel design approaches, such as design and construction based on reuse of reclaimed material. Reciprocal structures were used in the past for different purposes, but in this context, it is worth noting their use for solving the practical issue of spanning distances especiallly in slabs when the available elements were shorter than the span. The use of reciprocally connected elements allows defining a set of variables that allows adapting to design constraints and goals related to structure and construction. Computational strategies are investigated to generate layouts that are able to span planar configurations with non-standard reclaimed elements. This work presents an optimization study for the design of standardized structural layouts for floors and/or walls, using the SPEA-II Multi Objective method.

NSS Mission Assurance (MA) processes and standards traditionally developed for expendable, single use launch systems have enabled more than one hundred successful Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) missions to date. These established tenets for mission success offer a valuable starting point in developing a successful strategy for launch vehicle reuse. Such a strategy entails defining system level considerations unique to reusable launch vehicles, as well as augmenting industry and government standards to address specific attributes of reuse. Existing requirements in the various industry and government standards pertaining to structural, propulsion, mechanisms, mass properties and dynamics establish the development, qualification and flight requirements for expendable launch vehicles.

As the concrete industry consumes high amounts of natural resources, both for clinkering and gravel aggregate production, one must focus on its sustainability, considering environmental and economic issues. Therefore, reuse of waste tire rubber in concrete or in other composite materials is a logical solution for sustainable production of construction materials. Hence, the paper is aimed at the development and testing of lightweight concrete composed of a high volume of crushed waste tire rubber used as partial replacement of natural silica aggregate. In order to access the effect of incorporation waste tire rubber-based aggregate in concrete composition, reference concrete mix based on silica aggregate only is studied as well. The crushed waste tire rubber is characterized by its powder density, specific density, and particle size distribution. Specific attention is paid to thermal transport and storage properties of waste rubber that are examined in dependence on compaction time. For the developed lightweight concrete, mechanical, hygric, and thermal properties are tested. The tested lightweight concrete is found to be alternative and environmentally friendly construction material possessing improved thermal insulation function, interesting hygric parameters and sufficient mechanical resistance.

A substantial share of these impacts is contributed by load-bearing systems because of their mass-and energy-intensive production process. Therefore, reusing structural components over multiple service lives has the potential to improve the sustainability of building structures. However, reusing structural elements entails reversing the conventional structural design process: the mechanical and geometric properties of available elements predetermine the geometry and topology of a structure. This paper presents structural optimization techniques: 1) for the design of multiple spatial structures from one stock of elements, and 2) for the synthesis of an optimal stock or kit-of-parts whose elements can be used in multiple structures. The objective of case 1) is to avoid the cutting of stock elements, i.e. to reduce waste. In case 2), the objective is to reuse stock elements in as many structures as possible. In both cases, the assignment of stock elements to the structure is obtained via combinatorial optimization. In addition, geometry optimization is employed to best-fit the structure geometry to the lengths of assigned stock elements. The potential of the proposed methods for large-scale applications is demonstrated via case studies of three spatial structures of complex layout: a dome, two three-chord trusses and a tower. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Architecture; Combinatorial optimization; Energy utilization; Geometry; Structural design; Building construction; Geometric properties; Geometry optimization; Large-scale applications; Load-bearing systems; Multiple structures; Structural component; Structural elements; Structural optimization",Conference Paper,Scopus

A main game changer in this field are the technologies of retro propulsion assisted landing, which is a concept of decelerating the vehicle during its return to ground by firing its engines against the velocity vector. To foster a cost-efficient and sustainable global and European launcher market there is not only an urgent need to build up the necessary know-how on state-of-the-art Vertical Take-off Vertical Landing (VTVL) Two Stage To Orbit (TSTO) concepts, but also to go beyond this approach. Historically, many concepts of Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) are based on Single Stage To Orbit (SSTO) designs. Therefore, in the EU Horizon 2020 project RETALT (RETro propulsion Assisted Landing Technologies), the VTVL approach is investigated in a twofold manner: A configuration similar to the SpaceX rocket “Falcon 9” serves as a reference for the state-of-the-art TSTO RLV. A configuration similar to the DC-X serves as a reference for a VTVL SSTO. In this way, the concept of vertical landing with retro propulsion is investigated in a more general way and has the potential to be applied to more concepts of future RLV. In the RETALT project research for both reference configurations is performed in the areas of aerodynamics, aerothermodynamics and flight dynamics and GNC, as well as advanced structural parts, materials, health monitoring systems, TPS, mechanisms and advanced propulsion assisted landing systems. This paper gives an overall overview of the project; the current status of the project will be presented and an outlook of future activities will be given.

Thus, the importance for assessing whether such a reusable launch vehicle (RLV) could be designed and built in Europe has increased. Due to this renewed interest in RLVs, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has initiated a study on reusable first stages named ENTRAIN (European Next Reusable Ariane). Within this study two return methods, respectively vertical take-off, vertical landing (VTVL) and vertical take-off, horizontal landing (VTHL) with winged stages, are investigated. The goal is to assess the impact of the return method on the launcher and to conduct a preliminary design of a possible future European RLV. In the first part of the study, which ended in 2018, a broad range of possible launcher designs considering different propellant combinations, engine cycles and staging velocities were investigated and compared. By the end of this part, the most promising VTVL stage such as the most promising VTHL stage were selected to be investigated in more detail. Those two concepts were subjected to a preliminary system design and performance estimation, coupled with an aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic investigation of the re-entry loads and their impact on the structure. Furthermore, analyses of the dynamic behavior of descending RLV stages are considered. With the know-how gained within this study, the design of both launchers shall be enhanced to a level that brings it closer to a viable future reusable European launcher.

However, current commercialized spheroid culture tools have the shortcomings of high cost or relatively poor spheroid-forming results for some special cells. To solve such problems, we designed a 3D printed, reusable, stamp-like resin mold that could shape microstructures for spheroid culture of tumor cells on the surface of agarose substrate in a 96-well plate. We applied this homemade three-dimensional culture tool in spheroid formation for hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

In addition, the drug-sensitive test based on patient-derived hepatocellular carcinoma cells showed a different pattern between spheroid and two-dimensional cultures. In conclusion, our spheroid culture tool is characterized by its low cost, reusability, low cell consumption, convenience in medium exchange, and good effect of spheroid formation, suggesting that this technique could be widely used in individual treatment and high-throughput drug screening. © The Author(s) 2019.","3D culture; agarose; drug screening; primary hepatocarcinoma cells; spheroids","3D printers; Cell culture; Costs; Diagnosis; Plates (structural components); Reusability; Tumors; 3-d cultures; Agarose; Culture plates; Drug-screening; Hepatocarcinoma; Hepatocellular carcinoma cell; High-throughput; Primary hepatocarcinoma cell; Spheroid; Three-dimensional culture; Cells; albumin; alpha fetoprotein; breast cancer resistance protein; cisplatin; cytochrome P450 2C9; cytochrome P450 3A4; cytokeratin 18; doxorubicin; fluorouracil; gemcitabine; glucuronosyltransferase 1A1; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; hepatitis B surface antigen; oxaliplatin; phalloidin; aged; Article; cancer cell culture; cell function; cell proliferation assay; cell viability assay; clinical article; controlled study; drug metabolism; drug sensitivity; female; fluorescence imaging; gene expression; high throughput screening; human; human cell; human tissue; IC50; immunofluorescence microscopy; immunohistochemistry; liver cell carcinoma; male; maximum plasma concentration; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA isolation; three dimensional imaging; three dimensional printing; tumor spheroid; two-dimensional imaging",Article,Scopus

Over 95% are thought to be of wood-frame or masonry and wood construction. Most of this building stock was constructed using wood sourced from old-growth forests across the eastern seaboard. The city now sits on a stockpile of wood which germinated before New Amsterdam became New York, and which was felled while signatories of the Declaration of Independence were still President; this is structurally valuable hard, dense and high strength-to-weight ratio wood. As our buildings degrade and require renovation or replacement the city must ensure that this resource is not wasted, for environmental and economic reasons. The total number of buildings is large, but because of the rapid and repetitive way that NYC was constructed the variation in building type and structural element sizes across the building population is small. Cross referencing NYC department databases using geographic information systems allowed the Department of Buildings to produce an estimate of the number of buildings in the city of each type. Assessment of historic pattern books, prescriptive regulations, and inspection of existing buildings allows generic estimates of wood dimension and quantity per building type. Combined, this data allows the estimation of the annual rate of release of wood from demolition in NYC - a predicted supply available for future use.

For example, within almost every major city in the world, there are upscale enclaves centered around the adaptive reuse of factories and warehouses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These former industrial structures are almost always constructed from masonry and mass timber. Within the past decade, the building industry has seen a renewed interest in mass timber structures. This resurgence has been fueled by several trends, including the mass production of Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) and a growing awareness of mass timber's sustainable advantages. A number of high-profile heavy timber structures have found commercial success in the United States and abroad. Leading architectural practices such as Skidmore Owings & Merrill (SOM) have used research initiatives like the Timber Tower Research Project to jump-start a fertile debate within the design industry. On the demand side, building owners have pushed the design community to find innovative ways to incorporate mass timber into their projects. This interest has often driven designers and builders to aggressively distinguish their projects from predecessors, pushing for pure mass timber structures while giving less consideration to hybrid structures (mass timber and masonry/concrete structures). This bias towards material purity risks ignoring important lessons from the past and may in some cases lead to inefficient structural choices and structures with less durability and sustainability than their hypothetical hybrid counterparts.

Here, we address the issue of aqueous contamination by persistent pollutants such as antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) from an innovative angle. Simultaneous degradation of an antibiotic (chloramphenicol) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (chloramphenicol resistant E. coli) is performed to observe the effect of the presence of antibiotic in the reaction system when it is required for survival of the bacteria. A p-n junction-based ZnO/CuI composite is shown to demonstrate drastic enhancement in photocatalytic activity due to the inbuilt potential barrier suppressing charge carrier recombination. Moreover, an additional driving force for the suppression of recombination was provided by using a potential bias. Hydrothermally grown ZnO/CuI electrode films were characterized to assess optical, electrochemical, physicochemical and structural properties of the composite. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy were performed to obtain insights into the band bending, band edge potential, band gap and transmittance of the semiconductors. X-ray-based spectroscopic methods and zeta potential measurement demonstrated the surface properties and surface charges of the moieties in the reaction system, allowing us to deduce justifiable conclusions. A model based on the interaction of photogenerated radicals with the bacteria was developed and rate expressions were used to obtain the rate constants for the experimental results. Photoelectrocatalysis and photocatalysis followed first order rate kinetics; however, due to the unavailability of direct hole attack in photolysis, the electrolysis and electrocatalysis followed Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics. Bacterial disinfection was confirmed by K+ ion leaching and by structural changes in the membrane observed by FTIR of the cells after the reaction. We also addressed the issue of bacterial adhesion on the films restricting the mobility of radicals to interact with the bacteria, affecting the reusability of the catalyst films. The present work opens a wide avenue to discuss and address the improvement of the reusability of nanomaterial films for bacterial applications by controlling bacterial adhesion. © 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Adhesion; Biodegradation; Composite films; Disinfection; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Energy gap; Escherichia coli; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Kinetics; Photocatalytic activity; Photolysis; Physicochemical properties; Rate constants; Reusability; Semiconductor junctions; Spectroscopic analysis; Wide band gap semiconductors; Zinc oxide; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Charge carrier recombination; Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics; Photo-electrocatalysis; Simultaneous degradation; Visible light responsive; Zeta potential measurements; Antibiotics",Article,Scopus

CD nanofibers were produced by electrospinning an aqueous HP-β-CD solution containing a multifunctional cross-linker (i.e., 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid, BTCA) and were subsequently cross-linked by heat treatment, which led to an insoluble electrospun poly-CD nanoweb. The poly-CD nanoweb was decorated with Pd nanoparticles (Pd-NPs) by atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique over 20 cycles to give rise to a catalytic electrospun nanoweb (i.e., Pd@poly-CD). The formation of the Pd-NPs on the poly-CD nanofiber surface was clearly evidenced by TEM and STEM imaging, which displayed the homogeneously distributed Pd-NPs with a mean size of 4.34 nm. ICP-MS analysis revealed that the Pd content on the Pd@poly-CD nanoweb was 0.039 mg per mg of nanoweb. The catalytic performance of the Pd@poly-CD nanoweb was tested for the reduction of a nitroaromatic compound (i.e., 4-nitrophenol (4-NP)), and high catalytic performance of the Pd@poly-CD nanoweb was observed with a corresponding TOF value of 0.0316 min-1. XPS was used to explore the oxidation state of Pd atoms before and after the catalytic reduction of 4-NP, and no significant change was observed after catalytic reactions. In brief, the Pd@poly-CD nanoweb having handy, flexible, structural stability and reusability can be effectively used in environmental applications as a heterogeneous nanocatalyst for the reduction of toxic nitroaromatics. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aromatic compounds; Atoms; Catalytic oxidation; Cyclodextrins; Nanocatalysts; Nanofibers; Nanoparticles; Palladium; Reusability; Stability; 4-nitrophenol (4-NP); Catalytic performance; Catalytic reduction; Environmental applications; High catalytic performance; Nitroaromatic compound; Palladium nanoparticles; Structural stabilities; Atomic layer deposition",Article,Scopus

The architecture of NAA-μQVs-composed of two highly reflective NAA-based gradient index filters (NAA-GIFs) with a physical cavity layer in between-is engineered by sinusoidal pulse anodization to tune the characteristic resonance band of these photonic crystals (PCs) across the visible-NIR spectrum. NAA-μQVs are chemically functionalized with photo-active layers of TiO2 by the sol-gel method. Photocatalytic enhancements in TiO2-NAA-μQVs are identified by monitoring the photodegradation of model organics with absorbance bands at specific positions within the visible spectral region. The performance of TiO2-NAA-μQVs under controlled visible-NIR irradiation is enhanced by resonant recirculation of light within the semiconductor PC's structure. These enhancements are found to rely strongly on the relative position between the resonance band of TiO2-NAA-μQVs and the absorbance band of model organics, and on the light confinement quality. Overall photocatalytic degradation is also dependent on the total thickness of the PC structure and the molecular steric structure of organics. Reusability and effect of the crystallographic phase of photo-active TiO2 layers in TiO2-NAA-μQVs to degrade a model organic are also demonstrated. This study provides new opportunities to develop highly performing, cost-effective, industrially scalable and reusable photocatalyst materials capable of achieving an efficient management of photons at the nanoscale to accelerate photocatalytic reactions by light confinement effect.

Although it is obvious that the construction industry has been crucial for realizing building and civil infrastructures, it is also clear that building activities have a big impact on the environment. Still growing and developing societies and economies do need even more buildings, more roads etc. The question is how all these needs can be accomplished without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs (Brundtland Report). In this contribution the urgency of a sustainable construction industry is explained. The need for a change from building in the service of growth to building in the service of sustainability is emphasized. Comprehensive models, with which the entire building cycle can be simulated, would enable engineers to analyse the building and construction process with respect to the demand for raw materials and energy, maintenance and repair, renovation and retrofitting and, finally, recycling and reuse of materials and/or structural components. The option of developing a serious game for sustainable construction is discussed and recommended. With such a game the whole building cycle is simulated, ranging from decision making by stakeholders to execution on the site, curing, maintenance and repair in the service life phase, decommissioning, recycling and reuse. © 2019 Delft University of Technology.

The colour is changed when the coating is wetted and it returns to its original colour after drying. In addition, the surface presents better reusability and thermostability which satisfies various daily needs.

The construction consists of a large number of straight length-adjustable bars pin-jointed via so-called knots and enables extremely efficient and stable support structures with high potential for lightweight construction. The focus of the project was on the development and manufacturing technology implementation of the basic components (bar and node) aside from the form finding by parametric model. Depending on the structure of the gridshell, up to six bars are to be connected in the node in order to avoid eccentricities of forces which lead to a twisting of the node and undesirable bending loads on the bars. The developed node guarantees the coincidence of the bar axes in the centre of the node and in addition allows an angular adjustment. For the manufacturing technology implementation the injection moulding with fibre reinforced polyamide, 3D printing with polyamide and the aluminium casting were investigated and evaluated. Due to the very good mechanical properties, the high potential for lightweight construction and the translucency, glass fibre reinforced plastic (GRP) pipes were used for the bars. Due to the anisotropy of GRP the development of a special force transmission system was required to transfer high loads in the pipes without damaging the fibres. The force transmission system also permits a longitudinal adjustment of the bars. As a result of the research, a pavilion in lightweight gridshell design was implemented, which is characterized by free formability and very good load capacity as well as a high degree of variability and reusability of the individual parts. © 2019 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Form finding; Gridshell; GRP; Lightweight design; Mobile architecture; Parametric design; Support structure","3D printers; Aluminum castings; Architecture; Fiber reinforced plastics; Ground supports; Injection molding; Reinforcement; Reusability; Form finding; Grid shells; Lightweight design; Mobile architecture; Parametric design; Support structures; Structural design",Conference Paper,Scopus

The method was developed especially for single-storey steel buildings, but can be applied with some modifications for any component (or cluster of components) reclaimed from a demolished or refurbished building. It enables classification of various building parts and products through a procedure to calculate their reusability index. These values can be further used to produce a single reusability indicator of the whole end-of-life scenario (e.g. the complete or partial building reuse). The aggregated result of the whole building may be very useful in planning of demolition or reconstruction works as well as for the assessment of the environmental impact of the new buildings. The main novelty explored in this paper is the possibility of integrating the economical prospect of the recovered components in the reusability assessment. Indeed, the earlier developed reusability index was purely based on the technical requirements of recovering, remanufacturing and reusing component. Hence, it was a technical reusability indicator. The added element here is the possibility to include information on the prospective marketability of the recovered component.

Despite the two main steel connection methods, welding and bolting, being slow and/or expensive field activities, a new universally applicable, structural steel connection mechanism has not been introduced in more than a century, regardless of the new manufacturing capabilities available. It is clear that by improving and refining these features of multi-storey steel buildings, considerable savings in both weight and cost could be achieved. To achieve these savings, improved construction efficiency and heightened material reuse, a new class of interlocking steel connections using computer-controlled, advanced manufacturing techniques in laser cutting has been developed that rely on neither bolting nor welding. This paper presents the experimental testing and numerical modelling of the flange of the new interlocking steel connection in direct tension. A series of experimental tests were performed to capture the behaviour and failure modes of the new steel connection under tension. A simplified two-dimensional (2D) finite element (FE) model has been created using the ABAQUS software. The connection model accounts for material and geometric non-linearity, large deformation and contact behaviour. Contact is critical to model the tensile behaviour of the joint and was modelled using a surface to surface contact interaction taking into consideration friction between the surfaces. The model has been analysed through the elastic and plastic ranges up to failure and predicts the failure mode of the connection well. The comparison with the experimental data shows that the 2D model has a very good level of accuracy and the highest effectiveness in terms of computational time and memory usage. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","ABAQUS; Advanced manufacturing techniques; Contact; Experimental testing; Finite element modelling; Interlocking steel connection","ABAQUS; Building materials; Contacts (fluid mechanics); Engineering education; Life cycle; Manufacture; Microalloyed steel; Safety engineering; Steel testing; Urban transportation; Welding; Advanced manufacturing; Computational time and memory; Construction efficiency; Experimental testing; Finite element modelling; Manufacturing capability; Steel connections; Surface-to-surface contacts; Finite element method",Conference Paper,Scopus

Usually these buildings are protected by Cultural Heritage regulations. Therefore, it would be interesting to define suitable intervention strategies to maintain, conserve and possibly reuse them.

The residual capacity has been probabilistically evaluated in order to check the efficiency of the most vulnerable members of the structures and investigate systems’ robustness in case of sudden failure of the critical components.

Herein, we report the synthesis of hollow titanosilicate nanospheres encapsulating Pd and PdAu alloy nanoparticles (NPs) for the H2O2-mediated one-pot oxidation reaction. The yolk-shell nanostructured catalyst (Pd@Ti-HMSS), composed of a Pd NP core encapsulated within a hollow mesoporous titanosilicate shell having isolated Ti atoms, is fabricated by a facile etching and re-assembly process using SiO2 spheres as a template and two different kinds of Si alkoxides as precursors. The synthesized catalyst shows superior catalytic activity in the one-pot oxidation reaction of sulfide under a co-flow of H2 and O2, and far outperforms the prototype titanosilicate-supported Pd NP catalysts. Detailed structural characterization and kinetic analysis reveal that the increased catalytic efficiency is attributed to efficient mass transfer of reactants and the associated improved reactivity with in situ generated H2O2 over Ti sites. A further enhancement in activity is achievable by encapsulating PdAu alloy NPs, which provide a faster H2O2 production rate than monometallic Pd NPs.

The connection is applied to a case study which is representative of common buildings: a seven-story concrete structure with frames and deck slabs. The structural response of the connection accomplishes the Eurocode safety prescriptions. Man-hours and task duration decrease around 80%, and the global schedule undergoes 60% diminution.

By using CA-MoS4⋅LDH as adsorbent, we found more efficient removal of CIP than that of OFL due to the steric hindrance. The highest uptake of 707.20 mg/g and 476.74 mg/g of CIP and OFL, respectively, was found at pH of 6 with improved kinetics and easily reusability for these representative antibiotics models so far. Removal kinetics of both FQs were found to better follow the pseudo-second-order kinetic model than the pseudo-first-order. The Langmuir adsorption isotherm was employed to understand the removal process, suggesting monolayer chemisorption mechanism. The adsorbate-adsorbent interaction revealed remarkable features originate from the combination of weak hydrogen bond interaction between thio group and NH2+ group of antibiotic and electrostatic interaction between positive LDH layer and COO− group of antibiotic as well, and anion exchange mechanisms, which were also confirmed by XRD, FTIR, XPS and Raman spectrum etc. obtained after adsorption. It is proposed that all (MoS4)2− moiety offers stability to the CA-MoS4⋅LDH structure to avoid its solubility under ambient environments. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Fluoroquinolones; Layered double-hydroxide; Regeneration; Wastewater","Adsorption; Antibiotics; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen bonds; Kinetics; Monolayers; Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermogravimetric analysis; Wastewater; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray spectrometers; Anion-exchange mechanism; Energy dispersive x-ray spectrometers; Fluoroquinolones; Fluoroquinolones (FQs); Langmuir adsorption isotherms; Layered double hydroxides; Pseudo-second-order kinetic models; Regeneration; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy",Article,Scopus

Here, we demonstrated that by doping the generally believed catalytically inert A-site of LaMnO3 (LMO) perovskite with strontium, the catalytic performance for advanced oxidation is surprisingly boosted. Specifically, La0.4Sr0.6MnO3-δ (LSMO46) was designed which exhibited a high specific activity (0.0608 min−1 m−2) for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation, ∼6 times that of LMO and ∼41 times that of reported nanosized MnFe2O4 and Fe/Fe3C. The superior activity was also embodied by low activation energy (44.3 kJ mol−1). Moreover, LSMO46 displayed a lower metal leaching and a better reusability than LMO and Fe/Fe3C and easy catalyst recovery for its magnetic behavior. Such enhanced catalytic activity was attributed to the positively-charged surface (8.3 mV) that favored the adsorption of negatively-charged organics and the presence of a large amount of surface anion defects (oxygen vacancies), created by the doping, that induced the generation of considerable amount of singlet oxygen (1O2) which was demonstrated as the dominant reactive species by selective radical scavenging and EPR trapping. A coupled activation mechanism involving major singlet oxygen and minor free radicals was further proposed for the effective decomposition of organics in LSMO46/PMS system. The findings in this study thus provide us a new strategy for the development of efficient catalysts for advanced oxidation in environmental treatment. © 2018","Advanced oxidation; Doping; Perovskite; Single oxygen; Wastewater remediation","Activation energy; Catalyst activity; Catalytic oxidation; Decomposition; Doping (additives); Free radicals; Iron compounds; Lanthanum compounds; Manganese compounds; Metal recovery; Oxidation; Perovskite; Reusability; Strontium compounds; Advanced oxidation; Enhanced catalytic activity; Environmental treatment; High specific activities; Positively charged surfaces; Single oxygen; Structural flexibilities; Wastewater remediation; Oxygen vacancies",Article,Scopus

Among the three typical phases of ZIF-7, we discover that only the guest-free ZIF-7-II structure can be intruded by mechanical pressure, and intriguingly, this pressurized liquid intrusion behavior is detected only in nanocrystals, indicating the crystal size effect. Because of its unique combination of non-outflow property and high intrusion pressure, water intrusion into ZIF-7-II generates a marked energy dissipation capacity of ∼2 J/g despite its limited pore volume. We present several strategies that can be easily implemented to tune its intrusion pressure and energy dissipation and accomplish material reusability. Remarkably, we found that the pore cavities of ZIF-7-II can accommodate water molecules without experiencing any phase transition, which is entirely different from other solvents whose incorporation will trigger a spontaneous conversion into ZIF-7-I. Our pressure-vs-volume data further reveal that the process of water infiltration and retainment is controlled by the gate-opening/closing mechanism, which has enabled us to probe the viscoelasticity of ZIF-7 via cyclic liquid intrusion experiments. This study has deepened our understanding of the time-dependent mechanical properties of ZIFs and shed new light on the structural flexibility central to the novel applications of metal-organic framework materials. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","gate opening; hydrophobicity; intrusion pressure; liquid intrusion; phase transition; zeolitic imidazolate framework","Crystal structure; Crystalline materials; Energy dissipation; Hydrophobicity; Mechanical properties; Molecules; Nanocrystals; Organometallics; Phase transitions; Reusability; Energy dissipation capacities; Gate openings; Mechanical pressure; Metal organic framework materials; Novel applications; Pressurized liquids; Structural flexibilities; Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks; Liquids",Article,Scopus

The mutual interactions between aerodynamics, structural dynamics, and the flight control system may lead to the aeroservoelasticity problem. Thus, based on the six-degree-of-freedom geometry model of a RLV, the aeroservoelastic model is firstly established via hypothetical modal method and Galerkin method. Then, the overall attitude control strategy is carried out in two-loop subsystem controller by using backstepping method. For each loop subsystem, a sliding mode controller is developed to assure tracking of guidance commands, and the interval type-2 fuzzy logic systems combined with adaptive technique are employed to approximate the nonlinear parts to improve the reentry attitude tracking performance. Furthermore, the virtual control is introduced to the control strategy to attenuate the effect of control saltation. Theoretical analysis based on Lyapunov approach illustrates that the closed-loop system under the designed control method is uniformly stable, and the attitude tracking error converges to a small neighborhood around origin.

The functionalized architecture was constructed based on electrostatic interactions, which facilitate the reversible attachment-detachment sequence of the functional moieties within membrane pores. To demonstrate potential application, an enzyme, glucose oxidase (GOx), was electrostatically immobilized within the PLB-functionalized membrane and enzymatic catalysis was conducted under the convective flow mode. The GOx-immobilized membrane demonstrated satisfactory activity and stability. Convective flow of the substrate solution resulted in significantly higher activity than diffusive flow. Then, the enzyme was detached keeping the functional PLB backbone intact. Detachment of the enzyme without affecting the functional activity of PLB backbone permits attachment of fresh enzyme. In addition, reusability of the phospholipids is also of great importance as they have wide range of applications, but their usage is limited by higher cost. We have demonstrated the detachment of the PLB from the membrane using a simple technique. Characterization of the detached phospholipid confirmed retention of the original structural and functional properties as exhibited before attachment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on reversible PLB formation within membrane pores and demonstration of a detachment technique, while maintaining the structural and functional properties of the phospholipid.

Its interfacial shear strength, composite tensile strength and elastic modulus increased by 64.74%, 27.58% and 22.68% compared with that of untreated-CFs and composite, respectively. These best mechanical properties were ascribed to the formation of “fish-scale” layers on pull-out fibers resulted from CNT@PEI-CF modification. It could be concluded that CNT@PEI-CF would not only enhance its composite mechanical properties, but also exhibit much fiber pull-out and avoid the catastrophic failure for CNT@PEI-CF/PA66 composites. This CF surface modification study would be beneficial to expand application of thermoplastic composite with reusability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","A: Carbon fiber; A: Polymer; B: Fiber/matrix bond; C: Stress transfer; E: Injection molding","Contact angle; Crystallization; Grafting (chemical); Injection molding; Mechanical properties; Reinforcement; Reusability; Stability; Surface treatment; Tensile strength; Carbon fiber reinforced; Composite tensile strength; Crystallization behavior; Fiber/matrix bonds; Interface modification; Interfacial shear strength; Stress transfer; Thermoplastic composite; Fibers",Article,Scopus

This research explored the novel concept of reusing secondary timber as feedstock for cross-laminated timber (CLT). If cross-laminated secondary timber (CLST) can replace conventional CLT, structural steel and reinforced concrete in some applications, this constitutes upcycling to displace materials of greater environmental impacts. The fabrication process and mechanical properties of CLST were tested in small-scale laboratory experiments, which showed no significant difference between the compression stiffness and strength of CLST and a control. Finite element modelling suggested that typical minor defects in secondary timber have only a small effect on CLST panel stiffness in compression and bending. Mechanically Jointed Beams Theory calculations to examine the potential impacts of secondary timber ageing on CLST panels found that this has little effect on compression stiffness if only the crosswise lamellae are replaced. Since use of secondary timber to make CLST has a more significant effect on bending stiffness, effective combinations of primary and secondary timber and their appropriate structural applications are proposed. The article concludes with open research questions to advance this concept towards commercial application. © 2018 by the authors.","Building materials; C & D; Circular economy; Construction and demolition waste; End-of-waste; Lumber; Mass timber; Off-site manufacture; Re-use and recycling; Waste wood","bending; construction material; economic cycle; environmental impact; experimental study; industrial waste; mechanical property; stiffness; timber; timber industry; wood quality",Article,Scopus

The main issue related to this novel technology is the activity and stability of the CA enzyme under the typical flue gas conditions. To address this issue, CA enzymes were embedded into zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-L) nanoparticles to synthesize a novel CA/ZIF-L-1 composite. The composite exhibited a superior apparent catalytic activity (1.5 times higher) for CO 2 absorption compared with their free counterparts, which was due to the synergistic enhancement of CO 2 adsorption by support ZIF-L and enzymatic catalysis. The analyses of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and circular dichroism revealed that the CA enzyme's secondary structure was not significantly varied during the CA/ZIF-L-1 preparation, resulting in a high enzyme activity retention. Moreover, the CA/ZIF-L-1 possessed a high thermal stability and reusability due to the structural rigidity and confinement of ZIF-L scaffolds. Compared with the free enzyme, its thermal stability was improved by approximately 100% at 40 °C. After six cycles of reuse, CA/ZIF-L-1 still retained a relative activity of 134%. Therefore, the CA/ZIF-L-1 can be a good candidate to promote the CO 2 capture in industrial application. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Amines; Carbon dioxide; Carbonic anhydrase; Catalyst activity; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Dichroism; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Reusability; Scaffolds; Synthesis (chemical); Thermodynamic stability; Catalytic performance; Enzymatic catalysis; High thermal stability; Relative activities; Secondary structures; Structural rigidity; Synergistic enhancement; Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks; Enzyme activity; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; metal organic framework; nanoparticle; tertiary amine; unclassified drug; zeolitjic imadazolate framework; amine; carbon dioxide; immobilized enzyme; absorption; carbon dioxide; catalysis; comparative study; composite; enzyme activity; performance assessment; Article; circular dichroism; enzyme activity; flue gas; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; greenhouse gas; protein secondary structure; synthesis; thermostability; X ray powder diffraction; catalysis; Amines; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Catalysis; Enzymes, Immobilized",Article,Scopus

In this work, active and stable CuOx@ZnFe-LDH composite was prepared via co-precipitation method. A series of characterization methods were used to investigate the structural characteristics of the obtained products. The photocatalytic performance of the prepared composites were evaluate by degrading 4-nitrophenol under mild conditions. Besides, with the addition of persulfate, the photocatalytic degradation activity was greatly enhanced due to the synergistic effect of catalysts and ultraviolet light on persulfate activation. The results showed that CuOx@ZnFe-LDH composite obtained the best photocatalytic performance compared with ZnFe-LDH and ZnFe-CLDH, which could completely degrade 10 mg/L of 4-nitrophenol in less than 60 min. After four consecutive cycles CuOx@ZnFe-LDH composite could still remain remarkable reusability and stability. In addition, a possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism was proposed according to the characterization and experimental results.

In this paper, the three-dimensional mixed manganese oxides of OMS-2 and γ-MnO2 were fabricated through a simple refluxing method from KMnO4 and MnSO4. It was found that growth of γ-MnO2 nanoflakes on OMS-2 can be controlled by the concentration of MnSO4. The catalysts not only have many excellent structural properties such as interconnected network and highly exposed active sites, but also show the high ratio of low valent manganese species. In particular, the catalysts exhibited much higher efficiency for Acid Orange 7 degradation in the presence of PMS than pure OMS-2 or γ-MnO2. The oxidation of Mn(III) species by PMS occurs in the system with the formation of sulfate and hydroxyl radicals contributed to the dye degradation. Moreover, the catalysts showed good stability and reusability during four consecutive cycles.

The development of an adsorbent with enhanced removal efficiency for RhB is urgently needed. Herein, we report an environment-friendly synthesis of high quality zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) and functional ionic liquid@ZIF-8 in water-based system without heat treatment for improving its adsorption property. Guanidinium ionic liquids (ILs) could not only act as greener agents instead of volatile bases and toxic surfactants to efficiently control the nucleation and growth rate of ZIF-8, but also were incorporated as shell material to add specific adsorption sites. The relationship between nanoparticle structure and adsorption performance for RhB was systematically investigated. Due to high surface area (1167 m2 g−1), high porosity (0.79 cm3 g−1), high crystallinity, nano size (about 100 nm) and monodispersity, the as-obtained ZIF-8 showed improved adsorption capacity toward RhB (80% removal efficiency). Heteropolyanion-based guanidinium IL@meso-ZIF-8 (HPAIL@meso-ZIF-8) exhibited the high RhB uptake capacity of 278 mg g−1 (higher than most of the reported adsorbents) and effectively removed 99% of RhB within 15 min. The results showed that the adsorption process of prepared materials fitted well with pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm model. The existence of mesopores in ZIF-8 facilitated the diffusion of RhB and the incorporated guanidinium IL played a significant role in enhancing the adsorption affinity. Moreover, the reusability results revealed the HPAIL@meso-ZIF-8 as a highly efficient adsorbent for RhB removal with satisfactory performance and structural stability. Therefore, HPAIL@meso-ZIF-8 is one of the most promising adsorbents for organic dye removal from water. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption; Composite material; Guanidinium ionic liquid; Rhodamine B; Zeolitic imidazolate framework","Adsorbents; Adsorption; Composite materials; Dyes; Efficiency; Ionic liquids; Isotherms; Reusability; Stability; Functional ionic liquids; Guanidinium; Langmuir isotherm models; Nanoparticle structures; Pseudo second order kinetics; Rhodamine B; Zeolitic imidazolate framework-8; Zeolitic imidazolate frameworks; Rhodium compounds; guanidine; imidazole derivative; ionic liquid; nanoparticle; rhodamine B; unclassified drug; water; zeolitic imidazolate; adsorption; chemical compound; composite; dye; ionic liquid; reaction kinetics; zeolite; adsorption kinetics; Article; binding affinity; chemical structure; crystallization; dispersity; green chemistry; isotherm; particle size; pollutant; porosity; priority journal; room temperature; surface area; synthesis; waste component removal",Article,Scopus

X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies, revealed a spectacular structural phase transformation from anatase to rutile on doping and associated morphological changes are seen by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The phase transformation is promoted with the increase of W concentration up to 50 ppm and inhibited thereafter. Microstructural lattice distortions due to the presence of W 6+ ions are monitored by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The valence band X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) and UV–Vis absorption studies confirm the reduction of band gap for W doped TiO 2 mixed phase nanoparticles. The doping causes an enhanced visible light absorption. Room temperature photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy ensures an oxygen vacancy mediated phase transformation.

Therefore, in order to develop technologies for the reuse of electroerosive powders and to evaluate the effectiveness of their use, complex theoretical and experimental studies are required. The purpose of this work is the study of the porosity of additive products from electroerosive cobalt-chrome powders. For the implementation of the planned studies, wastes of the cobalt-chrome alloy of the brand KHMS ""CELLIT"" were chosen. As a working fluid, butanol (butanol-1) was used. For the production of cobalt-chrome powders, a unit for EED of conductive materials was used. Dispersion parameters: voltage 100 V, capacity 48 μF, repetition rate 120 Hz. Therefore, two or more pores because of the absence on the thin section of the visible boundary of their division can be fixed as one large. In addition, the method gives the distribution of pores in one plane of the sample, where narrow and wide sections of the sample fall, while in the hydrostatic weighing method and mercury porosimetry the pore sizes are fixed at their narrowest cross section. A consequence of these factors is the displacement of the function and distribution in the region of large pores. The porosity was determined using an Olympus GX51 optical inverted microscope with software for quantitative image analysis. Prepared samples had no traces of grinding, polishing or dying of structural components.

The significant enhancement in the photodegradation rates of RhB (∼5 times) and BPA (∼2 times) pollutants using 2% BiFeO3/BiOI composite is credited to the efficient charge separation of photoinduced hole-electron pairs by transferring the electrons from BiOI to BiFeO3 catalyst surface.

The higher photocatalytic activity, long time stability and reusability tests exposed that the BiFeO3/BiOI composite might be a potential photocatalytic material for topical applications in the field of water treatment. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","BiFeO3/BiOI composite; Bisphenol A; Degradation; Photocatalysis; Rhodamine B; Visible light","Absorption spectroscopy; Bismuth compounds; Complexation; Composting; Degradation; Efficiency; Iron compounds; Light; Light absorption; Phenols; Photocatalysis; Photocatalysts; Photodegradation; Pollution; Reusability; Rhodium compounds; Water treatment; Bis-phenol a; Degradation of pollutants; Photocatalytic activities; Photocatalytic materials; Photocatalytic performance; Photodegradation efficiency; Rhodamine B; Visible light; Iodine compounds",Article,Scopus

However, current technologies are neither efficient to impede the corrosion completely nor effective in the recycling of waste iron rust. To best recycle of waste iron rust, we report a simple, cost-free, and sustainable strategy to exploit iron rust as a Fe-precursor for the synthesis of magnetic Fe2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) via simple grinding and calcination process. The process efficiently transforms bulky iron rust into ferromagnetic Fe2O3 NPs, which exist in both α and γphases. Synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra, and vibrating sample magnetometer. We also explored the catalytic ability of rust-derived Fe2O3 as a low-cost material for the fabrication of magnetically separable g-C3N4-Fe2O3 composite as a photocatalyst. It is interesting to find that the g-C3N4-Fe2O3 composite exhibited superior photocatalytic activity than that of individual g-C3N4 and Fe2O3 under sunlight toward Methyl Orange and Textile Effluent. Moreover, the g-C3N4-Fe2O3 composite exhibited excellent reusability without loss of photocatalytic activity after successive five runs, and more importantly, photocatalyst could be recovered magnetically. The histological studies on the gills of freshwater fish Tilapia revealed that toxic dye solution induced damage to secondary gill lamellae, whereas the photodegraded products were found to less toxic and did not cause any structural alteration in the gill architecture. This innovative process of waste recycling offers a cost-free and large-scale approach to transform waste iron rust into magnetically separable Fe-based photocatalyst for environmental remediation. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","corrosion; g-C3N4-Fe2O3; heterojunction; iron rust; magnetic Fe2O3; photocatalyst; photodegradation","Azo dyes; Complexation; Corrosion; Effluents; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Hematite; Heterojunctions; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Iron; Nanomagnetics; Photocatalysts; Photocatalytic activity; Photodegradation; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Pollution induced corrosion; Recycling; Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Tellurium compounds; Textiles; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Environmental pollutions; Environmental remediation; g-C3N4-Fe2O3; Iron rusts; magnetic Fe2O3; UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra; Vibrating sample magnetometer; Waste management",Article,Scopus

The support materials are generated, for the first time, via the laser-vaporization-controlled condensation (LVCC) of Ti and amino-functionalized Ti metal-organic frameworks (MOFs): MIL-125(Ti) and NH2-MIL-125(Ti). Ultrasmall crystalline anatase phases with a small fraction of the rutile phase of TiO2 nanoparticles are well dispersed within C and N-doped C spheres, resulting in improved supports for the Pd nanocatalysts. The Pd nanoparticles are generated by the photocatalytic reduction of Pd4+ ions in aqueous solutions containing the MOF-derived carbonaceous or N-doped carbonaceous TiO2 nanostructures using pulsed-laser irradiation without any chemical reducing agents or surface capping materials. The laser photoreduction of the Pd ions is accompanied by oxidative etching of the C spheres, resulting in the formation of hollow C spheres that can encapsulate the Pd nanoparticles to prevent particle aggregation and also to increase the catalyst-support interaction. With 0.3 mol % Pd loading on the TiO2-decorated N-doped carbonaceous support, a 100% conversion to the biphenyl product from the reaction of bromobenzene and benzeneboronic acid is achieved within 5 min under microwave reaction conditions at 80 °C. The catalytic properties of the Pd catalysts supported on the LVCC-generated TiO2-decorated N-doped hollow C spheres far surpass those Pd catalysts supported on the original MIL-125(Ti) and NH2-MIL-125(Ti) MOFs as well as on the TiO2-decorated N-doped carbonaceous supports prepared by thermal pyrolysis of the NH2-MIL-125(Ti) crystals. The results indicate that the TiO2-decorated N-doped hollow C spheres with hierarchical meso/microporous structures provide an optimum support for the Pd nanoparticles for high activity and no significant Pd leaching in the Suzuki C-C cross-coupling reactions. The superior activity and excellent reusability of this nanocatalyst are attributed to the encapsulation of small Pd nanoparticles (2.1 nm) within the high-surface-area TiO2-decorated N-doped C support (216 m2/g) and the unique optimum catalyst-support interaction provided by the Pd/N-doped C/TiO2 interfaces. © 2018 American Chemical Society.","carbonaceous TiO2; hybrid support; laser vaporization; N-doped C spheres; Pd catalysts; Suzuki cross-coupling reactions","Agglomeration; Chemical bonds; Crystalline materials; Doping (additives); Etching; Laser beams; Metal nanoparticles; Nanocatalysts; Organic lasers; Organometallics; Oxide minerals; Palladium; Pulsed lasers; Reducing agents; Reusability; Spheres; Structural optimization; Synthesis (chemical); TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium; Titanium dioxide; Vaporization; carbonaceous TiO2; Hybrid support; Laser vaporization; N-doped; Pd catalyst; Suzuki cross coupling reactions; Catalyst supports",Article,Scopus

The growing perception that it is cheaper to repurpose vacant historical buildings rather than demolishing and rebuilding them is one of the factors that have made the adaptive reuse approach so popular. However, will this also be the case for provincial town centres in New Zealand? The purpose of this paper is to identify and explore the key factors that could influence the efficacy of adaptive reuse, and check for significant differences in the effect that each perceived factor would have on the adaptive reuse efficacy as a justifiable resilient and sustainable approach towards the regeneration of a major provincial town centre in New Zealand that is currently experiencing inner-city shrinkage. Design/methodology/approach: A focus group workshop was conducted with 22 stakeholders involved in an existing town centre regeneration agenda for Whanganui. Closed-ended questionnaires were administered to the workshop participants to measure their opinions regarding the efficacy of the adaptive reuse approach for the regeneration of Whanganui’s town centre. The participant mix comprised a combination of structural engineers, quantity surveyors, architects, estate valuers, building owners/developers, legal representatives, heritage representatives and local government council representatives. Findings: The study reported a high proportion of respondents that strongly agreed to the positive impacts of adaptive reuse with regards to the discussed priority aspects, hence, justifying the efficacy of the approach, towards delivering a vibrant town centre for Whanganui. Also, the Friedman’s analysis suggests that no significant differences existed among all perceived adaptive reuse efficacy criteria by the workshop participants, therefore justifying the approach. Originality/value: This paper’s originality pertains to the practicality of changing the use of vacant historical buildings in Whanganui, which is one of New Zealand’s major provincial town centres, to renegotiate resilience and sustainable urban regeneration for the area. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptive reuse; Efficacy; Historical buildings; Provincial; Resilience; Town centre regeneration","Surveys; Adaptive re use; Efficacy; Historical buildings; Provincial; Resilience; Town centre; Buildings",Article,Scopus

To some extent they help understanding class hierarchies for their modifiability, reusability and testability. Design level metrics can play an important role in discriminating class hierarchies with respect to their understandability. Unfortunately, inheritance metrics do not provide any insight on structural differences in different types of class hierarchies, as different class inheritance hierarchies result to the same of some the inheritance metrics, leading in lack of discrimination anomaly (LDA)[1]. To address this problem, present authors have proposed a vector approach based on discrimination of class inheritance hierarchies in [2]. In this paper, we introduce an improved metric for discrimination of class hierarchies using a linear combination of existing inheritance metrics. The empirical study indicates that different inheritance hierarchies can be differentiate applying the metrics-method inheritance factors, Average Depth of Inheritance, attribute inheritance factors and reuse ratio. Discrimination power of the new metric is analyzed and is shown to be useful in prediction of maintainability and testability. © 2018 IEEE.","Design Metrics; Software Maintainability","Cloud computing; Maintainability; Reusability; Design metrics; Inheritance hierarchies; Inheritance pattern; Linear combinations; Software maintainability; Software performance; Structural complexity; Structural differences; Object oriented programming",Conference Paper,Scopus

The granulometric, elemental analysis, point of zero charge (pHPZC), radiochemical and structural characterization were conducted using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and gamma spectrometry techniques. The optimal conditions and key factors influencing the adsorption process were assessed using the response surface method (RSM).

Proper characterization of the bridge foundation (embedment, load-carrying capacity, etc.) is necessary for bridge reuse when the original design conditions are changed because of scour, bridge widening, increased loading, or other changes to the structure. This paper presents rational means to analyze existing foundations using a hybrid analytical-numerical method so that reuse can be optimized. An integrated bridge load rating that considers the entire superstructure-substructure system can be established using the proposed method. Performing a quantitative integrated bridge load-rating analysis that considers geotechnical issues and soil-structure interaction for a substructure is essential to prevent functional or catastrophic failure under a live load. A reliable determination of the unknown pile embedment is also a prerequisite for a realistic integrated bridge load rating. The design criteria used when the bridge was originally constructed are important factors in the load rating process. Costly detours, repairs, replacement, or loss of life could be associated with inaccurate embedment estimates or use of criteria incongruous with the original design. The results of case histories show the importance of a realistic assessment of the pile embedment and of using appropriate geotechnical and structural design criteria when calculating the integrated load rating of bridges to advance the consideration of foundation reuse. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Bridges; Foundations; Load rating; Reuse; Substructure; Superstructure","Bridges; Foundations; Numerical methods; Piles; Soil structure interactions; Analytical-numerical method; Catastrophic failures; Integrated bridges; Load ratings; Reuse; Substructure; Substructure systems; Superstructure; Structural design",Article,Scopus

Increasing death rate of diagnosed cases is the main leading cause of designing specific genosensors for BRCA − related cancer detection.

An electrochemical method was applied as a simple and controllable technique for the electrochemical reduction of graphene oxide and also, electro − polymerization of pyrrole − 3 − carboxylic acid monomer. The results of the present work show that the polymer − coated reduced graphene − oxide provide more active sites compare to polymer − coated glassy carbon electrode for the DNA probe immobilization. The fabricated signal − off E − DNA sensor employs Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) techniques for monitoring the electrochemical behavior of the redox probe. To survey the morphological pattern and surface structural characterizations, the Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) have been applied, respectively. The applicability of the modified surface layer toward DNA sensing was evaluated by both DPV and EIS measurements. This platform permits quantitative determination of BRCA1 in the range of 10 fM–0.1 μM with a limit of detection as low as 3 fM. The proposed genosensor showed a perfect discriminatory power between complementary, non − complementary and mismatched DNA sequences.

The oil-wetted filter was recovered by rotational centrifugation and reused in the next filtration. The cyclic filtration behavior of the assembly was characterized by oil removal efficiency, oil sorption capacity, influence of packing density and number of filtration cycles. The efficiency of liquid removal and oil recovery from the centrifuged filter were also investigated. Cattail filters showed an excellent oil cyclic filtration performance which was found to have a close relationship with the inner structural characteristic of the fibers. The filters removed vegetable oil and diesel completely from runoff in the initial 40–90 min and 30–60 min in the first cycle, respectively, after which the oils broke through the filter’s body and 29.4–71.4 L and 21.0–46.2 L of clean water were collected. The time of breakthrough was decreased with decreasing cattail’s packing density. The wetted filters which absorbed up to 693.11 g (14.81 g/g) of vegetable oil and 497.02 g (10.62 g/g) of diesel took separately 7 min and 30 s to be recovered.

Herein we presented a 5-methylbenzotriazole modified graphene oxide (MBTA-GO) as a novel adsorbent, in which benzotriazole group was used as targeted sorption site bearing strong affinity toward An-Ln (An and Ln) ions for the first time. MBTA-GO was characterized by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of pH and initial concentration on combined adsorption of An-Ln were examined, and the results showed that the adsorption of metal ions on MBTA-GO was strongly dependent on pH in multi-cation solution, and MBTA-GO exhibited excellent An-Ln selectivity (selectivity coefficients are more than 99%), overwhelming majority of other reported adsorbents. The cycle experiments revealed that the MBTA-GO exhibited good reusability and structural stability. By density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the binding energy of Cation-MBTA-GO followed the order of Th(IV) > U(VI) > Eu(III) > La(III) > Sr(II) > Cs(I), suggesting that the benzotriazole groups were preferentially responsible for An-Ln ions on MBTA-GO, which is in well agreement with the experimental results.

Then, the obtained MP@RF core-shell particle was decorated with functional metal nanoparticles such as Pd, Au, or Pt (defined as MP@RF-Pd, MP@RF-Au and MP@RF-Pt, respectively). To protect the metal nanoparticles, another hybrid CTAB/SiO2 (hSiO2) shell was constructed on the above particle through the surfactant-templated sol-gel process.

This problem has two aspects, which differ in specificity of the approaches to designing the elements of space shuttle systems (SSS). The first aspect is associated with ensuring the reliable functioning of the most thermally stressed elements of the re-entry glider, which are structures with large angles of attack, such as fuselage nose and leading edge, wing loading edge, elevators and air intake edges. The second aspect mainly concerns ensuring the allowable temperature level of the spacecraft pressure shell on all flight path segments, especially during re-entry in the Earth’s atmosphere. In view of this, one of the main goals in creating SSSs is to develop a reliable heat shield having acceptable size and weight parameters, and cost. The successful solution of these problems is determined in many respects by the optimal choice of appropriate classes of materials: special high-temperature alloys, structural ceramics, highmelting-point metallic and polymeric composite materials. For the modern structures of SSSs, the use of structural metallic materials is worth-while in many respects. Rig test procedures are proposed. A complex of gas-dynamic test rigs was used as the basic equipment, whose fundamental design features and methodological solutions ensure the complete rig test cycle for the solution of problems in both directions. The methodological basis of rig tests is a set of specialized procedures for the simulation of thermally stressed states of the material and the intesity of the external action of the environment, which provide the equivalence of material damage processes and the limit state of the structural element under investigation under model and full-scale conditions. The fundamental basis of these approaches is the classical similarity and dimensional theories, the main postulates of which have been transformed and adapted to the problems of the study of the strength of materials and damageability of structural elements under thermal cyclic loading in corrosive environments. The developed procedures and experimental means allowed the modeling of aerodynamic heating processes of the structural elements of space shuttles. It has been shown that the implemented methods enable the evaluation of functional characteristics, determination of a set of properties and refinement of the technology for the formation of structural elements of aerospace vehicles operating under the conditions of aerodynamic heating to extremely high temperatures. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","aerodynamic heating; modeling methods; space shuttle systems; thermally stressed state","Aerodynamic heating; Air intakes; Angle of attack; Atmospheric temperature; Composite structures; Heat shielding; Rockets; Space shuttles; Corrosive environment; Functional characteristics; Model method; Polymeric composite materials; Shuttle system; Stressed state; Structural elements; Thermal cyclic loading; Structural ceramics",Article,Scopus

This is because RFID can stimulate the reuse of construction components and reduce their wastage, hence addressing sustainability issues in the construction sector. To test the plausibility of that idea, this study explores the potential pre-conditions for RFID to facilitate construction components reuse, and develops a guidance for promoting their redistribution back to the supply chain. It also looks at how integrating RFID with Building Information Modelling (BIM) can possibly be a valuable extension of its capabilities, providing the opportunity for tracked components to be incorporated into new structures in an informed, sound way. A preliminary assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the RFID technology is presented in order to depict its current and future potential in promoting construction components’ sustainable lifecycle management, while emphasis has been laid on capturing their technical, environmental, economic and social value. Findings suggest that the collection of the right amount of information at the design-construction-deconstruction-reuse-disposal stage is crucial for RFID to become a successful innovation in the construction sector. Although a number of limitations related to the technical operability and recycling of RFID tags seem to currently hinder its uptake for structural components’ lifecycle management, future technological innovations could provide solutions that would enable it to become a mainstream practice. Taken together these proposals advocate that the use of RFID and its integration with BIM can create the right environment for the development of new business models focused on sustainable resource management. These models may then unlock multiple values that are otherwise dissipated in the system. If the rapid technological development of RFID capability can be allied to policy interventions that control and manage its uptake along the supply chain, the sustainable lifecycle management of construction components could be radically enhanced. © 2017 The Authors","Construction and demolition waste (CDW); Information flow; Lifecycle valuation; Reuse; RFID; Structural components","business; innovation; modeling; resource management; sustainability; technological development; human; model; radiofrequency identification; recycling; resource management; sound; commercial phenomena; recycling; technology; Commerce; Recycling; Technology",Article,Scopus

X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis confirm that these thiospinels consist of agglomerated nanoparticles (NPs) and contain multivalent metal cations. Among the sulfides synthesized at 230 °C, NiCo2S4 presents the highest thiophene conversion. This high intrinsic activity is found to be correlated with the normal spinel structure with Ni cations located on the tetrahedral sites and Co cations on the octahedral sites. However, the spent NiCo2S4 NPs experience phase transformation because of the relatively low synthetic temperature. Accordingly, six NiCo2S4 samples are prepared in the temperature range of 180-350 °C, and their HDS activity increases monotonically with the synthetic temperature, which is attributed to the higher structural stability and more surface sulfur vacancy of the NiCo2S4 NPs prepared at higher temperatures. Notably, the NiCo2S4 NPs synthesized at 350 °C exhibit a much higher thiophene conversation of 62.9% than the classic MoS2 catalyst (39.3%) as well as excellent reusability.

A part of Ag3PO4 is reduced by PDA and transformed into a Ag nanosphere, which further increases SSA and enhances the catalytic ability of the material by the plasmonic effect.

In the pre-demolition survey, information such as building design documents and steel material standard certificates are collected to confirm. After demolition of target buildings, based on the results obtained by destructive-test or non-destructive test, the degree of damage for reuse is evaluated. Design method of building steel structures for reuse consists of three types which are elastic design method, elasto-plastic design method, and design method considering damages of structural members, and they are used in accordance with structural performances. In this paper, the authors propose design method of building steel structures considering damage of structural members for reuse introducing reduction ratio. Seismic performance of braces in the longitudinal direction introducing reduction ratio of structural members is estimated. Between a dynamic ductility index of structure and reduction ratio of structural members are discussed by seismic response analysis. Seismic performances such as the ultimate displacement, the yield base shear force coefficient and initial natural period are investigated. The following findings are obtained from the results of our analyses. 1)The concept of seismic performance evaluation introducing the reduction ratio of structural members by strength and rigidity for reuse is shown. 2)Dynamic Ductility Index of each model with reduction ratio is proportional to the strength reduction ratio βs. Dynamic Ductility Index is approximately evaluated by index when the critical displacement decreases by the rigidity reduction ratio βD. 3)Dynamic Ductility Index of each model with reduction ratio increases in accordance with increasing average ductile coefficient. On the other hand, Dynamic Ductility Index of each model does not change in accordance with increasing a yield base shear coefficient. Dynamic Ductility Index is mainly affected by initial natural periods. 4)Required the yield base shear coefficient can be shown by Contour of Dynamic Seismic Performance Index using the reduction ratio of structural members. © 2018 Architectural Institute of Japan.

Membrane processes are an attractive opportunity because they generate a higher quality effluent than conventional PW treatment technologies at a competitive cost. The objective of the study was to compare the performances of ten membranes to treat PW and identify which of the structural and operational characteristics of the membranes are the success factors to ensure cost-effective, long-term and reliable operation. In oil and gas applications, ceramic filtration media is often preferred owing to its high structural robustness. Nevertheless, polymeric membranes offer the benefits of being less expensive and result in a lower footprint and weight. Tests using real oilfield PW were run to assess and compare ten membranes according to their oil rejection rate, permeability, resistance to fouling, life expectancy and resistance to ageing. All membranes tested achieved more than 99% removal of insoluble oil versus 80–85% for conventional technologies. The permeability over time and resistance to fouling were used to identify the most reliable and cost-effective membranes. The robustness of polymeric membranes was confirmed based on good resistance to ageing. © IWA Publishing 2018.","Filtration; Membrane; Oil; Produced water; Reinjection; Reuse","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Filtration; Gas industry; Membranes; Oil fields; Polymeric membranes; Polymers; Produced Water; Public utilities; Water conservation; Water filtration; Water treatment; Environmental concerns; Environmental footprints; Oil and gas companies; Operational characteristics; Reinjection; Reuse; Structural robustness; Treatment technologies; Microfiltration",Article,Scopus

Then the tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) functionalized acid-modified palygorskite (MPA) was synthesized via chemical impregnation. In addition, MPA spheres (MPAS) with average size of ∼3.6 mm were produced by a pellet machine. The prepared solid sorbents were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms treated by BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) analysis. The thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the CO2 adsorption capacity of nature palygorskite (0.63 mmol/g) could be enhanced through amine modification. The MPAS-50 had the best CO2 adsorption capacity (2.63 mmol/g) and excellent repeatable adsorption ability, according to the CO2 adsorption tests.

The characterization of small-angle X-ray diffraction, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and TEM confirmed that the polyacrylamidoxime was only coated on the mesopore walls with a thin layer rather than occupied the whole pores. The AO-OMC containing 16.8% polyacrylamidoxime (0.2AO-OMC) showed the highest adsorption capacity for U(VI) (322.6 mg·g−1 at pH = 5.0 and T = 298.15 K), which was significantly higher than CMK-3 (43.4 mg·g−1). XPS analysis suggested that the high adsorption capacity of 0.2AO-OMC was mainly attributed to the combination of U(VI) with abundant amidoxime groups via surface complexation and electrostatic interactions. The U(VI) selectivity was above 60% in a wide pH range from 3.0 to 5.0, which has not been reported to date, and reached the highest selectivity of 72.4% at pH = 4.0. The thermodynamic parameters calculated from temperature-dependent adsorption isotherms suggested that uranium adsorption onto 0.2AO-OMC was an endothermic and spontaneous process, and the 0.2AO-OMC exhibited excellent reusability and structural stability without any significant changes in the adsorption capacity after ten cycles.

This study takes into account of the relationship of FE grids, redundancy information, and optimal sensor placement performance by detailed statements. Furthermore, in order to reduce the redundancy information caused by too fine FE grids and too near measurements, the proposed sensor distribution index can synthetically deal with both cases of the nearer nodes and overall sensor distribution ranges. Moreover, by means of normalization and weighted factor, the constituted fitness function, which consists of Fisher information and sensor distribution index, can be more competitive by eliminating the gap of orders caused by the different fitness functions. Therefore, the economical FE grids are suggested, and the corresponding optimum sensor locations are simultaneously obtained by the hybrid optimization algorithm.

The photocatalytic action of the material was evaluated by methylene blue decomposition as determined by UV–visible spectroscopy. Anhydrous niobium oxide has a hexagonal structure. The X-ray profiles of the materials developed (XC-wNb) are similar to Nb2O5, confirming the presence of inorganic oxide in the matrix of these composites. The chemical elements that compose the samples are homogeneously distributed on the surface of the samples, confirming the dispersion of the oxide in the carbonaceous matrix.

The struts were machined with electrospark wire-electrode cutting techniques to form UHTC into the desired shape, and with laser drilling to drill tiny holes providing the channels for fuel injection. The integrated thermal-structural characteristic of the struts was evaluated in high-temperature combustion environment by the propane-oxygen free jet facility, subject to the heat flux of 1.5 MW/m2 lasting for 300 seconds, and the struts maintained integrity during and after the first experiment. The experiments were repeated for verifying the reusability of the struts. Fracture occurred during the second repeated experiment with the crack propagating through the hole. Finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out to study the thermal stress distribution in the UHTC strut. The simulation results show a high thermal stress concentration occurs at the hole which is the crack initiation position. The phenomenon is in good agreement with the experimental results. The study shows that the thermal stress concentration is a practical key issue in the applications of the reusable UHTC strut for fuel injection structure in scramjets. © 2018, Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","fracture; scramjet; strut; thermal stress; ultra-high temperature ceramic (UHTC)","Ceramic materials; Computer software reusability; Cracks; Fabrication; Finite element method; Flame resistance; Fracture; Fuel injection; Fuels; Heat flux; Hole concentration; Ramjet engines; Reusability; Silicon carbide; Silicon compounds; Stress concentration; Thermal stress; Zirconium compounds; Flame holding; Harsh environment; High-temperature combustion; Laser drilling; scramjet; Structural characteristics; Ultrahigh temperature ceramics; Wire electrode; Struts",Article,Scopus

In pyrolysis reaction, we found that copper oxide (Cu2O) formation is highly inhibited in the presence of urea. The photocatalytic dye degradation efficiency of methylene blue is much higher in Cu-g-C3N4 photocatalyst compared with hierarchical Cu2O, glass- g-C3N4 and physical coated Cu-g-C3N4 film. Pseudo-first order rate constant of the hybrid film is nearly 1.4 fold greater than that of the bare hierarchical Cu2O. The enhanced of the photocatalytic reaction may be attributed to the reduction of electron-hole recombination in g-C3N4.

To evaluate the sonocatalytic activity of the as-prepared MIL-101(Cr)/RGO/ZnFe2O4 nanocomposite, the H2O2-assisted degradation of organic dyes such as congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB), Rhodamine B (RhB) and methyl orange (MO) in aqueous solution was studied under ultrasound irradiation.

The enhanced sonocatalytic performance of the as-prepared ternary nanocomposite could be attributed to the fast generation and separation of charge carriers (electrons and holes) in ZnFe2O4 and MIL-101(Cr) and their transfer to the surface of graphene sheets. Moreover, the relatively high specific surface area of the MIL-101(Cr)/rGO and magnetic property of ZnFe2O4 improve the degradation efficiency of the dyes. The recovery of the ternary magnetic sonocatalyst from treated water could be easily achieved using an external magnetic field.

The reuse of this waste in the most common construction materials (e.g., concrete) may offer a sustainable solution. In the literature, the optimization of composites formulations generally focuses on aggregates plant pretreatment regardless of classical optimization parameters and the implementation process that can afford to get a high strength composite. The work presented herein is intended to optimize the mix design of a mortar made from poplar wood by-products, without involving any pretreatment. The conventional mix design parameters (i.e., paste volume, W/C ratio) have been varied. An optimal implementation technique (i.e., extrusion) was used. The wood mortar mix designs have been optimized in order to obtain composites compliant with French standard NF EN 771-3/CN, with respect to criteria regarding both dimensional tolerance and mechanical strength for structural elements (i.e., above 8 MPa at 7 days).A mortar mix design, optimized by means of extrusion, has been used as a reference. Poplar wood particles have been introduced through substitution for the sand volume. Test results indicate that the blocks produced from two wood mortar mixes with 60 and 70% wood aggregate-for-sand substitution rates are in line with the normative requirements relative to dimensional tolerances and mechanical strength.

This urban expansion poses a serious threat to historic properties when people opt to move away leaving behind their heritage. The adaptive reuse of heritage is considered to be a dominant strategy for handling this issue bypassing demolition of heritage properties. However, the adaptive reuse cannot only consider the preservation of the heritage as the structural retrofit or functional revitalization but rather it needs to enunciate the image and the creative ideation that reflect upon the future of heritage. Consequently, this paper aims to examine the role of branding as an innovative source of ideation in the implication of adaptive reuse on heritage. In this regards, the case study of Zalando outlet store in Berlin is selected, which is an old building situated in the commercial district of the city in a wide range of styles and heritage buildings from the middle ages. This research uses semi-structured interviews to examine the significance of Brand making in a successful adaptive reuse process. The findings indicate that the importance of the outlet building lies not only in its physical fabric or commercial aspects, but the spirit of the place that lies in the magical essence of big labels as emblems. This underlying essence of place stimulated the adaptation of building in a way that it surpasses the physical and functional aspect of a building and makes it merge in new times and new sustainable development. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Sustainable development; Adaptation of buildings; Adaptive re use; Dominant strategy; Functional aspects; Heritage buildings; Heritage conservation; Semi structured interviews; Urban expansion; Buildings",Conference Paper,Scopus

The influence of different parameters on the material behavior of natural fiber reinforced plastic structures has been investigated, showing the potential for transport application in energy absorbing structures. Two different woven fabrics (twill and hopsack) made of flax fibers as well as a non-woven mat made of a mixture of hemp and kenaf fibers were employed as reinforcing materials. These reinforcing textiles were impregnated with both HD-PE (high-density polyethylen) and PLA (polylactic acid) matrix, using a continuous compression molding press. The impregnated semi-finished laminates (so-called organic sheets) were thermoformed in a second step to half-tubes that were assembled through vibration-welding process to cylindric crash absorbers. The specimens were loaded by compression to determine the specific energy absorption capacity. Quasi-static test results were compared to dynamic test data obtained on a catapult arrangement. The differences on the specific energies absorption (SEA) as a function of different parameters, such as the wall thickness, the weave material type, the reinforced textiles, and the matrix used, depending on the velocity rate application were quantified. In the case of quasi-static analysis it is observed a 20% increment in the SEA value when wove Hopsack fabric reinforcement is employed. No velocity rate influence from the material was observed on the SEA evaluation at higher speeds used to perform the experiments. The influence of the weave configuration (Hopsack) seems to be more stable against buckling effects at low loading rates with 10% higher SEA values. An increase of SEA level of up to 72% for PLA matrix was observed when compared with HD-PE matrix. © 2018 by the authors.","Crash absorption; Impact behavior; Natural fiber; Specific energy absorption; Structural material","Automobile materials; Automotive industry; Building materials; Compression molding; Energy absorption; Fabrics; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Hemp; Hemp fibers; Kenaf fibers; Mechanical properties; Natural fibers; Reinforcement; Reusability; Sea level; Textile finishing; Textiles; Energy absorbing structure; Energy absorption capacity; Fiber-reinforcement composites; Impact behavior; Mechanical characteristics; Natural fiber reinforced; Specific energy absorption; Transport applications; Weaving",Article,Scopus

The MCM−41 with well-ordered mesopores acted as the structure-directing agent, which regulated the growth of MIL-101(Cr) crystals along a certain direction and restricted the expansion of framework. Meanwhile, the hydroxyl groups existed in MCM−41 preferentially coordinated with the Cr3+ centers in MOF, followed by the layer-packed arrangement of MIL-101(Cr) nanocrystals on the surface of matrix. The structural characterizations further revealed that the introduction of MCM−41 could increase the micropore volume and specific surface area.

The modified polymeric ionic liquid poly[ViEtIm]Br not only acted as interlink between the polar catalytic anion and the non-polar graphene substrate, but also endowed the favorable dispersibility of poly[ViEtIm]Br-rGO in ionic liquid, leading to the adequate exposure of immobilized catalytic sites during the process of desulfurization. Moreover, due to the reversible anion-exchange property of the modified poly[ViEtIm]Br, various anions of Brønsted acids or heteropolyacids could be sequentially ‘written in’ or ‘erased’ on the nanosheets of rGO for desulfurization, thus establishing a green model for screening suitable catalysts based only on the limits of the same carrier. Such a rewriteable cycle was confirmed and monitored by characterization of TEM, FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Based on this catalyst screening process of a rewriteable cycle, poly[ViEtIm][PW12O40]-rGO, a heteropolyanoin modified rGO, was selected as the optimized catalyst. Benefiting from the synergistic effects between rGO and acidic anions, together with the large surface area and open two-dimensional structure of rGO, poly[ViEtIm][PW12O40]-rGO was found to exhibit an excellent catalytic performance toward various sulfur-containing compounds. Furthermore, the outstanding reusability of poly[ViEtIm][PW12O40]-rGO was also displayed owing to its structural stability. It was found that the sulfur removal efficiency of DBT could still reach 98.0% after the catalyst poly[ViEtIm][PW12O40]-rGO had even been recycled eight times. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Desulfurization; Graphene-based catalyst; Polymeric ionic liquids; Reversible anion-exchange; Rewriteable function","Catalysis; Catalysts; Desulfurization; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Ion exchange; Ionic liquids; Ions; Liquids; Negative ions; Polymers; Reusability; Stability; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Anion exchange; Anion-exchange properties; Oxidative desulfurization; Polymeric ionic liquids; Reduced graphene oxides; Sulfur containing compound; Sulfur removal efficiency; Two-dimensional structures; Graphene",Article,Scopus

Recycling of this waste to produce new materials like sand concrete appears as one of the best solutions for reduces the problem of pollution. This work aims to study the possibility of recycling waste coffee grounds (Spent Coffee Grounds (SCG)) as a fine aggregate by replacing the sand in the manufacturing of dune sand concrete. For this; sand concrete mixes were prepared with substitution of sand with the spent coffee grounds waste at different percentage (0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% by volume of the sand) in order to study the influence of this wastes on physical (Workability, bulk density and porosity), mechanical (compressive and flexural strength) and Thermal (Thermal conductivity and thermal diffusivity) properties of dune sand concrete. The results showed that the use of spent coffee grounds waste as partial replacement of natural sand contributes to reduce workability, bulk density and mechanical strength of sand concrete mixes with an increase on its porosity. However, the thermal characteristics are improved and especially for a level of 15% and 20% of substitution. So, it is possible to obtain an insulating material which can be used in the various types of structural components.

Their performance in fire is important for successful structural applications while their post-fire residual capacities are also important to assess the extent of their fire damage and reusability with and without strength enhancing techniques. This paper presents the details of an experimental investigation on the post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steel hollow sections. Tensile tests were performed on coupons exposed to elevated temperatures varying from 100 to 800 °C and then cooled down to room temperature. These coupons were cut from cold-formed steel square and rectangular hollow sections with varying thicknesses and grades. The results from this investigation provided post-fire stress-strain curves, yield strengths, ultimate strengths and elastic modulus, and their reduction pattern. They show that the post-fire mechanical properties of cold-formed steel hollow sections are different to those of open cold-formed channel and hot-rolled sections. New predictive equations were proposed to determine the post-fire mechanical property reduction factors. Post-fire mechanical properties were also compared with their elevated temperature mechanical properties to evaluate their strength gain after cooling down.

By simply tuning the temperature, the obtained LAPS composite fibers achieved an unprecedented thermal energy storage capacity up to 81.6% of pristine LA. This capacity was higher than the reported values in the literature which were generally less than 50%. The thermally triggered nanocapillary transportation and encapsulation of LA did not alter the size and morphology of PS hollow fibers. Furthermore, the LA was contained inside PS hollow fibers, leaving the interfiber space and surface free of LA. Direct SEM observation, IR spectra, Raman spectra, XRD diffractograms, and simultaneous TGA-DSC thermograms of LAPS composite fibers proved that the amount of encapsulated LA declined with the elevation of temperature. The distribution of LA in PS hollow fibers was found to be homogeneous across the membrane by TGA and SEM. Further, the LAPS composite fibers demonstrated a robust cycling stability and reusability without notable deterioration of thermal storage capacity during 100 continuous heating-cooling cycles.

There has long been a need for fluoride removal from potable water to make it safe for human use. From among several defluoridation technologies, adsorption is the technology most commonly used due to its cost-effectiveness, ease of operation, and simple physical process. In this paper, the adsorption capacities and fluoride removal efficiencies of different types of adsorbents are compiled from relevant published data available in the literature and represented graphically. The most promising adsorbents tested so far from each category of adsorbents are also highlighted.

Thereafter, a mathematical modelling approach was adopted to develop BWPE using the identified factors and principle/concept of Weibull reliability distribution for manufactured products. The model was implemented in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and it was tested using case study design. Accordingly, the whole-life salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated. The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life.

Results of X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that P adsorption was controlled by a precipitation mechanism. Amendment of P-laden engineered biochar into the soil planted with lettuce significantly improved soil available P, organic carbon content, soil moisture, and pH. As a result, seed germination, crop growth, crop yields and P concentration of lettuce were promoted. These results suggested that RSM optimization increased the P adsorption capacity of the engineered biochar. Moreover, the P-laden engineered biochar derived from cow dung can be reused as soil amendment to serve as slow-release P fertilizer. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cow dung; Engineered biochar; Eutrophication; Phosphorus; Reclaim; Slow-release fertilizer","Binders; Bins; Building materials; Carbon; Cements; Characterization; Compressive strength; Drying; Fibers; Hemp; Hemp fibers; Hydrated lime; Lime; Minerals; Portland cement; Repair; Strength of materials; Thermal conductivity; Walls (structural partitions); Water absorption; Capillary water absorption; Dynamic modulus of elasticity; Energy intensity; Low-carbon emissions; Natural materials; Rammed earth walls; Scientific knowledge; Water absorption coefficient; Mortar",Article,Scopus

Though photocatalysis is effective, complete removal can be achieved faster using photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) using photoconductive materials. Based on this idea, we have developed a network structured, high photoconductive copper oxide using solution combustion method. Various characterizations such as XRD, DRS, SEM, TEM, PL, XPS have been performed for a meticulous study of structural, optical, morphological and oxidation properties, respectively. CuO synthesized in this study possesses band gap of 2.1 eV, monoclinic structure, low recombination of charge carriers and shows much higher catalytic activity than copper oxide nano rods reported in the literature. Both antibiotics and bacteria have been simultaneously degraded via PEC. PEC exhibited a threefold higher rate of antibiotic degradation compared to photocatalysis. Reactive radical species such as electrons and superoxide radicals were illustrated to play a key role in accelerating the process of degradation. Notably, CuO-CSA was stable even after 10 cycles of reusability. A detailed mechanism of degradation PEC was developed and the cyclic network model was proposed for validation of the series of reactions. The degradation rate coefficients were obtained from this model.

Based on eXtensible Markup Language (XML) document, a general aerodynamic database is established, which realizes management and reuse of aerodynamic data. On the basis of surrogate based optimization (SBO), an efficient method of aerodynamic shape optimization assisted by aerodynamic database is proposed, which contains two new database-assisted optimization strategies. The first one is the database-assisted quick design, which can generate optimal design just in seconds without any additional CFD evaluation. The result of quick design is almost same with a 50 CFD evaluations’ SBO result. The second strategy is the database-assisted optimization based on hierarchical kriging (HK) model, which can accelerate the original SBO. This strategy converged to the best solution quickly with only 40% computational cost compared to SBO. It is proved to be robust and efficient by a rudder optimization test case. These cases show that the proposed method has great potential to become a useful optimization tool for detailed design of aircraft in the future. © 2018, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a new approach to meet safety and operational requirements especially in the above said conditions. We propose a new carbon fiber strain sensor, to be coupled to a fiber optic strain technology to realize a fail-safe/fault tolerant â€œsensors systemâ€: reading the same variables using different technologies improves radically the space modules structure monitoring. This double sensor system has been developed to provide existing and future spaceships with SHM capability due to its unique superior characteristics and reliability. This paper covers the aerospace SHM requirements and the results of the tests carried out, comparing the strain measured with the fiber optic sensor technologies to the strain as measured with a newly developed carbon fiber (In-C) sensor. In particular, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor technology and In-C sensor technologies are evaluated as the most promising tool for load monitoring and damage detection, the two critical SHM aspects of space structures. Carbon fiber sensors have never been used before as strain gauges but inexpensiveness, lightness, flexibility, and the same sensitivity of the FBG (less than 1 micro-strain) show the potential of this just patented technology. The strong cost reduction possible with In-C sensors opens the possibility of a large use of SHM systems in all the aerospace structural components. Combined with Bragg fiber sensors, gives a strong result in terms of measurement reliability and data significance. At last, in the paper the case report on the integration of this stand-alone sensor into a space structure is provided. The sensor will be integrated in the spacecraft mechanical structure, but avoiding any data connection with the space module data system and requiring only occasional power supply. The proposed solution will allow a strong cost reduction, and significant power saving, also decreasing the software complexity, assuring a longer safe lifespan of the spaceships and launchers reusability.

High performance LOX/Kerosene has been developed in China, and the advanced research about LOX/Kerosene gas generator engine has also been studied for the future demand of reusable launch vehicle (RLV). One of the key technologies for reusable engine is damage-mitigating analysis. The engine works in an extremely harsh environment. It is needed to carry out damage-mitigating research and deeply analyze the failure mode of the components. The purpose of the damage-mitigating analysis is to solve the events of structure cumulative damage and the structural life impacted by parameters. For reusable engine, the main failure mode includes thermal fatigue of chamber, vibration fatigue of structure, friction and wear, as well as components creep, aging, etc. In present paper, the thermal shock fatigue of chamber is studied in detail. Thermal shock fatigue is one of the main damage modes in LRE which uses regenerative cooling system. Thermal shock means the high-level thermal stresses generated as a result of significant temperature gradients which occur during engine start-up, shut-down and thermal transient conditions.

The selected launchers were modelled in more detail, including the preliminary design of major subsystems such as propulsion, aerodynamics, structure, propellant management and the thermal protection system. The comparison of different potential propellants is made across the different return options in order to assess the suitability of the various possible combinations.

RUAG's approach relies on controlled separation, de-tumbling and deceleration, to ensure the structural integrity of the two composite halves during the atmospheric re-entry and landing. Once recovered and refurbished, the structures would then be available for re-use. To reach this goal, the development activities aim to establish recovery systems and procedures, as well as developing structures capable of being refurbished and reused in a cost-effective manner. Ongoing efforts include the development of a payload fairing instrumentation system, the end-to-end modelling of the payload fairings re-entry mission, and the definition of subsystems for their stabilization and deceleration.

So far, only a few studies on environmental impacts of buildings have been conducted in the context of Sri Lanka. Reliable data sources that match the specific conditions of the country are limited. Using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, this paper presents a cradle-to-gate energy and carbon emission study of a multi-storey residential building in a Sri Lankan university. The total embodied energy and carbon of the building are 3.84 GJm-2 and 229.34 kgCO2m-2, respectively, which are comparable with results of similar studies found in literature. Reinforced concrete, the main structural material, contributed to 61 % of total embodied energy and 71 % of total embodied carbon of the building.

In order to achieve low-energy and low-carbon buildings in Sri Lanka, several strategies were identified; suitable construction practices and building designs to reduce quantities of mass materials, use of alternative materials with low energy and carbon intensities, material recycling and reuse, use of clean and renewable energy for production processes and popularising the concept of eco-labels for building materials.

The construction of defect band levels with heterostructural phases of catalytic nanostructures is a tenable strategy for separating photogenerated charge carriers and for minimizing carrier recombination. Herein, we explain an effective carrier separation rate with extended light absorption using electrospun ZnTi-based semiconducting nanofibers, which feature as composites and ternary form for their structural geometry. We explain the effective surface functionality with the design of the ZnO-TiO2 composite and ZnTiO3 as a function of the annealing temperature on electrospun fibers, and their commendable visible catalytic properties with the presence of defect states for degrading organic pollutants. The constructed ZnTiO3 in the form of nanofibers induced a narrow band gap of 3.01 eV as compared with its individual counterparts (ZnO (3.27 eV) and TiO2 (3.17 eV)). However, the composite functionality has an advantage in inducing discrete defect levels with the carbon impurities for favorable extended visible absorption with a similar morphological nature. Under visible irradiation, the ternary form of the nanofibers exhibited a photocatalytic degradation performance of around 72.45% and the composite fibers exhibited one of around 95.82% in 125 min due to the scrutinized function of the defect states that maximize the interfacial charge transfer between ZnO-C-TiO2 and delay the carrier recombination rate. The reliable mechanism behind the charge transfer of the photogenerated carriers was supported by trapping experiments of two different geometrical nanostructures on degrading organic pollutants. The interesting results obtained from the stability and reusability studies were that the ZnO-TiO2 composite nanofibers have a notably surface photocorrosive nature after catalytic reaction but the ternary ZnTiO3 form of the nanofibers has a stable surface stability with stable reusable catalytic functionality for up to 20 consecutive cycles.

The used methodology is Life Cycle Assessment. The EIMME® software, associated with the eco-invent database, is used to quantify the potential environmental impacts of the considered walls. Obviously, some steps of the wall life cycle have a small environmental footprint, for example, the consumer use step provides low impacts, while the end of life step (post-consumer) allows a “saving” (i.e., a diminution) of impacts because a part of the materials can be reused. On the other side, the raw material procurement and manufacturing steps are at the origin of the greatest impacts. Among the chosen indicators, the main environmental impacts are found to be the energy consumption, the air toxicity, the 100-year global warning, and the use and treatment of water. To minimize the impacts (environmental footprint), local producers should be preferred. The assembly is finally compared to a conventional wall realized by using glass wool and breeze blocks. According to the obtained results, the “straw wall” is shown to be better for the environment regardless of the considered indicator, excepted for the air toxicity for which the values of the two studied walls are of the same order of magnitude.

Herein, we report a useful strategy involving anchoring ferrocene on sepiolite (FeCp@Sep) with high dispersity by-C2H4-chemical bond. Ofloxacin (OFX, 100 ml 10 mg L-1) was 100% degraded in FeCp@Sep system with H2O2 (2.0 mmol L-1) under visible light irradiation (&gt;420 nm). However, only a structural transformation of OFX occurred in FeCp system under the same conditions. The open mesoporous system in FeCp@Sep facilitated the molecular diffusion and transportation. Hence, high concentration of OFX resulted in high removal efficiency in FeCp@Sep system due to the surface profusion of OFX. Moreover, uniformly dispersed and spatially separated FeCp encapsulates Sep, which can not only enhance the reusability of FeCp, but also favor the occurrence of the surface deep oxidation process. Based on the results of ESR analysis and UV-vis spectroscopy, the Fenton degradation process by OH, 1O2, and HO2 occurred on the surface of FeCp@Sep instead in the bulk solution.

This paper discusses conceptual architectural and structural options for recycling these blades by reusing parts of wind turbine blades in new or retrofitted housing projects. It focuses on large-sized FRP pieces that can be salvaged from the turbine blades and can potentially be useful in infrastructure projects where harsh environmental conditions (water and high humidity) exist. Since reuse design should be for specific regional locations and architectural characteristics the designs presented in this paper are for the coastal regions of the Yucatan province in Mexico on the Gulf of Mexico where low-quality masonry block informal housing is vulnerable to severe hurricanes and flooding. To demonstrate the concept a prototype 100 m long wind blade model developed by Sandia National Laboratories is used to show how a wind blade can be broken down into parts, thus making it possible to envision architectural applications for the different wind blade segments for housing applications. © 2018 by the authors.

The implication is that regulatory requirements become difficult to meet. This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging on BIM (building information model) as a central data repository of component information. The contributions of the paper include identifying additional attributes to support DfD, as well as proposing a rule-based compatibility analysis. This will allow potential matches of DfD components between the current building and the future reuse to be automatically identified.

Consequently, unsectioned needle specimens must be processed whole: A procedure which cannot necessarily be accomplished through manual methods, or by retasking automated pathology machines. Thus millifluidic devices (for millimeter-scale biopsies) are an ideal solution for tissue handling/preparation. TBs are large, messy and a solid-liquid mixture; they vary in material, geometry and structure based on the organ biopsied, the clinician skill and the needle type used. As a result, traditional microfluidic devices are insufficient to handle such mm-sized samples and their associated fabrication techniques are impractical and costly with respect to time/efficiency. Our research group has devised a simple, rapid fabrication process for millifluidic devices using jointed skeletal molds composed of machined, reusable metal rods, segmented rods and stranded wire as structural cores; these cores are surrounded by Teflon outer housing. We can therefore produce curving, circular-cross-section (CCCS) millifluidic channels in rapid fashion that cannot normally be achieved by microfabrication, micro-/CNC-machining, or 3D printing. The approach has several advantages. CLINICAL: round channels interface coring needles. PROCESSING: CCCS channels permit multi-layer device designs for additional (processing, monitoring, testing) stages. REUSABILITY: for a biopsy/needle diameter, molding (interchangeable) components may be produced one-Time then reused for other designs. RAPID: structural cores can be quickly removed due to Teflon®'s ultra-low friction; housing may be released with ethanol; PDMS volumes cure faster since metal skeleton molds conduct additional heat from within the curing elastomer. © 2018 SPIE.","3D optical imaging and reconstruction; Cancer detection and diagnosis; Histopathology; Microfabrication; Millifluidics/microfluidics; Needle biopsy transport; Pathology lab-on-A-chip; Tissue sample preparation","BioMEMS; Biopsy; Curing; Diseases; Housing; Microanalysis; Microfabrication; Microfluidics; Microsystems; Molds; Needles; Pathology; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Reusability; Cancer detection and diagnosis; Histopathology; Millifluidics/microfluidics; Needle biopsy; Optical imaging; Tissue sample preparation; Tissue",Conference Paper,Scopus

The collective agenda is focused on retaining, refurbishing and recycling the existing elements by transforming wastes into new resources. This continuous cycle represented by the extension of the product life cycle and the enhancement of the discarded parts in the built environment is changing the economic system used for many centuries. The current linear economy model is going progressively to be converted into a more circular economy. Many sectors—like infrastructure, foods, enterprises, design etc.—are improving their efficiency by adopting a more circular pattern, but construction companies seem to be very far from this purpose. As one of the main sectors responsible of global energy consumption and waste production, the construction industry has to undergo a radical change in perspective on urban development, along with a new social, cultural, and economic interest in rebuilding the existing city in a sustainable way. The aim of this research is to highlight how to transform the construction industry through the circular economy to make urban reuse strategies more sustainable in social, economic and especially environmental terms. The paper considers not only the theoretical implications of the economic paradigm of circularity, but also case studies through which it is possible to evaluate its relevance in terms of design, production and management of such a new perspective. Through a critical analysis of the more relevant circular interventions in Europe to upcycle obsolete buildings, the research highlights the new fundamental rules for the construction industry to regenerate the existing cities. In particular, the cases studies show how the economic and environmental benefits apply to a circular model in the construction industry and how this system is able to generate new social and economic value in existing buildings. The second element is to show how to combine the circular economy with costs via technologies able to match circularity and environmental efficiency. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Circular economy; Construction industry; Modular construction components; Pre-fab components; Sustainable urban regeneration","Construction industry; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Life cycle; Modular construction; Structural design; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Circular economy; Construction companies; Economic and environmental benefits; Economic interests; Environmental efficiency; Pre-fab components; Product life cycles; Urban regeneration; Industrial economics",Book Chapter,Scopus

The investigated titanium dioxide (in anatase form, obtained via the sol-gel method) exhibited a surface area of 59.5 m2/g according to Brunauer-Emmett-Teller theory, and its structure is a combination of both meso- and microporous. The average pore diameter calculated by the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method was 6.2 nm and the cumulative volume of pores was 0.117 m3/g. The imine SP1 exhibited columnar organization (Col), while SP2 revealed a hexagonal columnar crystalline phase (Colhk). The imine:TiO2 mixtures in various weight ratio (3:0, 3:1, 3:2, 3:3) showed a lower energy gap and HOMO-LUMO energy levels compared to pure TiO2. This implies that TiO2 provides not only a larger surface area for sensitizer adsorption and good electron collection, but also causes a shift of the imine energy levels resulting from intermolecular interaction. Also the temperature of the phase transition was slightly affected with the increase of TiO2 concentration in imine-based composites. The changes observed in the Fourier transform middle-infrared absorption (FT-MIR) spectra confirmed the significant influence of TiO2 on structural properties of both investigated imines. Similar interactions of oxygen vacancies existing on the TiO2 surface with SP1 and SP2 were observed. The imine:TiO2 mixtures showed good air stability and reusability, which demonstrates its potential for organic device applications. © 2018 Rózycka et al.","Azomethines; Composites; HOMO-LUMO; Imines; Organic devices; TiO2","Composite materials; Light absorption; Mixtures; Oxides; Oxygen vacancies; Reusability; Sol-gel process; Sol-gels; Titanium; Azomethines; Homo-lumo; Imines; Organic devices; TiO2; Titanium dioxide",Article,Scopus

In this work, we prepared a 2D Cu-containing layered double oxide (CuLDO) under mild conditions. Only via stirring LDO in diluted Cu solution at room temperature could ion exchange between Mg in LDO and Cu ions from that solution allow fixing of Cu onto the surfaces of LDO nanosheets with good dispersion at a high density. The obtained CuLDO was then annealed to give CuOx-rich nanosheets (denoted as c-CuLDO), which maintained a thin thickness of 5-9 nm with a flowers-like architecture thanks to the structural memory of the source materials. The excellent morphology of CuOx-based nanosheets helped to avoid the restacking of nanosheets. Such a c-CuLDO outperformed many other reported Cu-based nanomaterials as a catalyst in phenol degradation (k = 0.335 min-1) because c-CuLDO could efficiently activate persulfate to generate abundant amounts of sulfate radical (SO4-). Furthermore, the catalytic activity of used c-CuLDO could be restored by a simple hydrothermal treatment. The developed chemistry could also be used to remove copper ions from wastewater, generating value-added Cu-based nanomaterials and eliminating waste at the same time.

This depends on three key parameters—income level, size of dwelling unit and affordability. This paper aims to point out the various aspects of predestined building methodologies by highlighting the different available techniques, and the economical advantages achieved by its adoption. In a building the walls, floors and roofs are the most important sections, which can be analyzed distinctively based on the needs, thus, improving the speed of construction and reducing the construction cost. This paper also aims to cover the use of local materials in the different components of building to make them as low cost available solutions for low income groups. To own a house by middle and lower income groups in today's economic trends is very difficult. Therefore, it has now became a necessity to adopt cost effective, innovative and environment-friendly housing technologies for the construction of houses and buildings and availing them at low cost comparatively. In order to come up with viable solutions this paper compares the construction cost for the traditional and low cost housing technologies and it was observed that with the use of technology and reuse of waste material as building material the cost of construction can be minimized to an extent. It was observed that with if the filler slab can be used as an alternative to conventional slab the cost of construction can reduce upto 25%. With the time more studies are going to identify the reuse of waste material like fly ash, rice husk, etc as building material. After realizing the true potential of these waste materials as building material in construction industry the cost can be minimized to a greater extent.

Multi-objective optimization approaches enable exploration of the trade-off problems to find sustainable design strategies, but there has been limited research in applying it to find optimal design solution(s) considering the embodied versus operational energy trade-off. Additionally, integration of this approach into a Building Information Modeling (BIM) for facilitating set up of the building model toward optimization and utilizing the benefits of BIM for sharing information in an interoperable and reusable manner, has been mostly overlooked. To address these issues, this paper presents a framework that supports the making of appropriate design decisions by solving the trade-off problem between embodied and operational energy through the integration of a multi-objective optimization approach with a BIM-driven design process. The applicability of the framework was tested by developing a prototype and using it in a case study of a low energy dwelling in Sweden, which showed the potential for reducing the building's Life Cycle Energy (LCE) use by accounting for the embodied versus operational energy trade-off to find optimal design solution(s). In general, the results of the case study demonstrated that in a low energy dwelling, depending on the site location, small reductions in operational energy (i.e. 140 GJ) could result in larger increases in embodied energy (i.e. 340 GJ) and the optimization process could yield up to 108 GJ of LCE savings relative to the initial design. This energy saving was equivalent to up to 8 years of the initial design's operational energy use for the dwelling, excluding household electricity use. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Building information modeling; Design; Embodied energy; Genetic algorithm; Life cycle energy; Multi-objective optimization; Operational energy; Trade-off","Buildings; Design; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Housing; Information theory; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Optimal systems; Structural design; Sustainable development; Building Information Model - BIM; Embodied energy; Life cycle energies; Operational energy; Trade off; Architectural design",Article,Scopus

Studies on the role of sulfur in the catalytic activity enhancement were carried out by comparing with a sulfur-free activated carbon and a carbon model (reduced graphene oxide (rGO)). The effects of catalyst dosage, initial 4CP concentration, and reaction temperature on 4CP degradation were comprehensively investigated. In addition, contrast tests with other conventional PS activation methods, SDAC-800 reusability and its general applicability tests were also carried out. The mechanism of PS activation and 4CP oxidation was elucidated by using quenching tests with chloridion, L-histidine and ethanol as radical scavengers. It revealed that the conventional radical pathway was not a critical role in 4CP degradation.

The surface chemistry of the prepared AC was modified by introducing or blocking certain functional groups, and the role of the different functional groups involved in the copper uptake was investigated. The structural and chemical heterogeneity of the produced carbons are characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Boehm titration method and N2/77 K adsorption isotherm analysis. The equilibrium and the kinetics of copper adsorption onto AC were studied. The results demonstrated that the functional groups on AC played an important role in copper uptake. Among various surface functional groups, the oxygencontaining group was found to play a critical role in the copper uptake, and oxidation is the most effective way to improve Cu (II) adsorption onto AC.

More specifically, it is demonstrated that Ag nanoparticles (AgNPLs) chemically immobilised onto activated carbon (AC-AgNPLs) can act as an effective solid sorbent for removal and/or minimisation of selected crystal violet (CV) dye from aqueous solutions by conducting experiments on water samples. Spectroscopic tools such as FTIR, SEM, TEM and XRD were used in the characterisation of the adsorbent before and after adsorption. The adsorbent dose, pH, contact time, rotation velocity, initial concentration of adsorbate and the temperature effects were examined to evaluate their role in the percentage elimination of crystal violet. Crystal violet uptake was favourable in alkaline media at pH > 7.0, while the Langmuir model revealed CV monolayer adsorption capacity of 87.2 mg/g. The pseudo second-order model fitted the data well and the thermodynamic parameters (ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG) of CV retention revealed that the uptake is endothermic and spontaneous in nature. When AC-AgNPLs was utilised, it removed a greater CV percentage from aqueous solution relative to AC. The mechanism of adsorption was explored using the intra-particle diffusion model and the liquid-film model. Desorption studies were made to elucidate recovery of the adsorbate and adsorbent for the economic competitiveness of the removal system.

For a given time window both modes can occur simultaneously only close to the wave source or to a defect that leads to mode conversion.

Here we demonstrate the preparation of a novel class of self-supported, cellulose-graft-polypropionic acid (CL-g-PPA) cation-exchange nanofiber membrane adsorbers under mild reaction conditions for the purification of positively charged therapeutic proteins. In our fabrication method, acrylonitrile was first polymerized and surface grafted onto cellulose nanofibers using cerium ammonium nitrate as a redox initiator to form cellulose-g-polyacrylonitrile (CL-g-PAN). CL-g-PAN was then submitted to a hydrolyzation reaction to form CL-g-PPA cationic membrane adsorbers. Morphology and structural characterization illustrated the formation of CL-g-PPA membranes with uniform coating of polyacid nanolayers along the individual nanofibers without disturbing the nanofiber structure. Benefiting from these numerous cationic polyacid binding sites and inherent large surface area and open porous structure, CL-g-PPA nanofiber membrane adsorbers showed a lysozyme static adsorption capacity of 1664 mg/g of nanofibers. These membranes showed a lysozyme dynamic binding capacity of 508 mg/g of nanofibers at 10% breakthrough (equivalent to 206 g/L capacity), with a residence time of less than 6 s. Moreover, CL-g-PPA self-supported nanofibers displayed excellent structural stability and reversibility after several cycles of protein binding studies. This dynamic binding capacity of the CL-g-PPA nanofiber membranes was 3.2 times higher than that of macroporous cellulose membranes and 8.5 times higher than that of the Sartobind S commercial membrane adsorber. Considering the simple fabrication method employed, excellent protein adsorption capacity, remarkable structural stability, and reusability, CL-g-PPA nanofiber membranes provided a versatile platform for the chromatographic separations of biomolecules (e.g., proteins, nucleic acids, and viral vaccines) as well as water purification and similar ion-exchange applications. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","cation-exchange; cellulose nanofiber; membrane adsorbers; protein purification; redox polymerization","Adsorption; Binding sites; Bins; Biochemistry; Cellulose; Efficiency; Enzymes; Grafting (chemical); Ion exchange; Ion exchange membranes; Liquid chromatography; Membranes; Nucleic acids; Positive ions; Proteins; Purification; Reusability; Stability; Vaccines; Adsorbers; Cation exchanges; Cellulose nanofibers; Protein purification; Redox polymerization; Nanofibers; Cation Exchange; Cellulose; Membranes; Polymerization; Proteins; Purification",Article,Scopus

This contribution generalizes an existing formulation for optimizing modular trusses to include (1) reusability of modules among multiple structures and (2) practical considerations in design, such as multiple types of modules, multiple load cases, the capability to compute the displacements in an elastic design formulation, and limitation on stresses. This methodology is demonstrated for the conceptual design of single- and double-story simply supported bridges.

Because of the specific structural and different functional components, the as-prepared Pd/MoS2-rGO showed superior catalytic performance and reusability towards the cross-coupling reactions and the reduction of 4-nitrophenol.

The structural bearing system of compartments was designed as moment-resistant frames having 11.80 m height. In some halls a space truss roof construction with tubular steel bars which were joining in Mero type assemblies was pin-supported on the columns which were fix on their bottom. Steel columns were made from hot rolled I sections or built-up box sections. Tensile tests were performed on specimens taken from various columns and a tubular space truss member in order to determine post fire mechanical properties. Also, residual factors defined as the ratio of post fire mechanical properties to those at room temperature, and exposed temperatures of the samples were estimated by referring the results of a previous work in the literature. In this approximation, yield strength to ultimate tensile strength ratio of the samples subjected to controlled heating to and cooling from elevated temperatures in the previous work were taken as the reference, and the present results were evaluated based on those results.

Furthermore crystallinity is reduced upon Pd doping. The crystallite size decreased from 42 to 35 nm and 31 for pure, 5 and 10 wt% Pd doped SnO2 respectively. A noticeable red shift in the absorption edge was found and band gap narrowing in the range of 3.67–3.25 eV after doping by Pd.

The immobilization of lysozymes on 3DOm COOH could be confirmed by the characterizations of transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Zeta-Potential. In addition, the structural stability of lysozymes on 3DOm COOH were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The antibacterial performance of 3DOm COOH-Lyz were specifically investigated based on the disinfection efficacy of Staphylococcus aureus in water. The results revealed that the immobilization capacity and relative activity of immobilized lysozyme were 814 mg/g carrier and 80%, respectively, under the optimal immobilization conditions.

Here, we describe simple and economical superhydrophobic hybrid membranes for effective oil/water separation. Eco-friendly, antifouling membranes were fabricated for oil/water separation, waste particle filtration, the blocking of thiol-based odor materials, etc., by using a cellulose membrane (CM) filter. The CM was modified from its original superhydrophilic nature into a superhydrophobic surface via a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer technique. The block copolymer poly{[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl acrylate]-block-myrcene} was synthesized using a ""grafting-from"" approach on the CM. The surface contact angle that we obtained was >160°, and absorption tests of several organic contaminants (oils and solvents) exhibited superior levels of extractive activity and excellent reusability. These properties rendered this membrane a promising surface for oil/water separation. Interestingly, myrcene blocks thiol (through ""-ene-"" chemistry) contaminants, thereby bestowing a pleasant odor to polluted water by acting as an antifouling material. We exploited the structural properties of cellulose networks and simple chemical manipulations to fabricate an original material that proved to be effective in separating water from organic and nano/microparticulate contaminants. These characteristics allowed our material to effectively separate water from oily/particulate phases as well as embed antifouling materials for water purification, thus making it an appropriate absorber for chemical processes and environmental protection. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","antifouling polymeric membrane; cellulose biomembrane; hydrophobic block copolymer; oil absorption; oil/water separation","Block copolymers; Cellulose; Environmental protection; Filtration; Free radical polymerization; Hydrophobicity; Membranes; Microfiltration; Monoterpenes; Oil spills; Organic compounds; Reusability; Separation; Water pollution; Antifouling; Bio membranes; Hydrophobic blocks; Oil absorption; Oil/water separation; Driers (materials); Absorption; Block Copolymers; Cellulose; Membranes; Oil; Polymers; Separation; cellulose; oil; water; chemical phenomena; chemistry; oil spill; water management; Cellulose; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Oils; Petroleum Pollution; Water; Water Purification",Article,Scopus

However, there are still some problems associated with the preparation, application, and recovery of nanomaterials. Herein, we report for the first time a novel approach for one-step synthesis of porous hybrid fibers (PHFs), which can be used as an effective adsorbent for dye removal from polluted water. A low-cost biopolymer cellulose was chosen as the matrix of the fibers, whereas a NaOH solution was applied as the coagulation bath for the cellulose spinning dope that contained a certain amount of FeCl3. The obtained Fe(OH)3@Cellulose PHFs exhibited a multiscaled pore structure, with the in situ generated Fe(OH)3 nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the regenerated cellulose nanofibrous network of the fibers. These structural attributes are quite advantageous for an efficient adsorbent. The maximum Congo red removal capacity of the Fe(OH)3@Cellulose PHFs reached 689.65 mg/g, which was much higher than many early reported values. Importantly, the Fe(OH)3@Cellulose PHFs could favorably remove the dye at natural pH through filtration adsorption with excellent reusability.

Herein, we design layered double hydroxide (LDH)-based Fe-MoS4, a highly efficient adsorbent, for selective removal of heavy metals. We initially synthesized FeMgAl-LDH and then enriched its protective layers with MoS42- anions as efficient binding sites for heavy metals. Various characterization tools, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CHN analysis, and inductively coupled plasma analysis, were applied to confirm structural and compositional changes during the synthesis of Fe-MoS4 as final product. The prepared Fe-MoS4 offered excellent attraction for heavy metals, such as Hg2+, Ag+, Pb2+, and Cu2+, and displayed selectivity in the order Hg2+ ∼ Ag+ &gt; Pb2+ &gt; Cu2+ &gt; Cr6+ &gt; As3+ &gt; Ni2+ ∼ Zn2+ ∼ Co2+. The immense capacities of Hg2+, Ag+, and Pb2+ (583, 565, and 346 mg/g, respectively), high distribution coefficient (Kd ∼ 107-108), and fast kinetics place Fe-MoS4 on the top of materials list known for removal of such metals. The sorption kinetics and isothermal studies conducted on Hg2+, Ag+, Pb2+, and Cu2+ suit well pseudo-second-order kinetics and Langmuir model, suggesting monolayer chemisorption mechanism through M-S linkages. XRD and FTIR studies suggested that adsorbed metals could result as coordinated complexes in LDH interlayer region. More interestingly, LDH structure offers protective space for MoS42- anions to avoid oxidation under ambient environments, as confirmed by XPS studies. These features provide Fe-MoS4 with enormous capacity, good reusability, and excellent selectivity even in the presence of huge concentration of common cations. © 2017 American Chemical Society.","adsorption; complexation mechanism; Fe-MoS4 LDH; heavy-metal removal; wastewater","Adsorption; Binding sites; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Coordination reactions; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Heavy metals; Inductively coupled plasma; Iron compounds; Kinetics; Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Silver; Spectrum analysis; Wastewater; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Characterization tools; Complexation mechanisms; Distribution coefficient; Energy dispersive x-ray; Heavy metal removal; Inductively coupled plasma analysis; Layered double hydroxides; Pseudo second order kinetics; Copper",Article,Scopus

Once completed the filling capacity of the pond, the need for identifying a possible reuse of mud produced by the plant arose in order to avoid landfill disposal. Therefore, mud has been geometrically, physically and chemically characterised for its recovery as construction material. A variety of tests was carried out on mud samples as required by EN technical specifications and by Italian environmental standards, focusing particularly on leaching behaviour. The tested material showed satisfactory physical and chemical properties and a release of pollutants below the limits set by the Italian code. Many mix-designs for the production of unfired bricks made of waste mud, sand and straw, stabilised and non-stabilised with lime, gypsum or cement, were developed. The bricks were tested in order to evaluate mechanical properties and leaching behaviour. Mud bricks provided remarkable compressive strength, even if not suitable for structural elements. The use as interior design to minimise humidity changes and to facilitate a thermal insulation is fostered, thus strengthening the so-called green building economy. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Aggregates; Architectural design; Building materials; Characterization; Compressive strength; Lakes; Leaching; Sustainable development; Thermal insulation; Environmental standards; Filling materials; Landfill disposal; Leaching behaviours; Physical and chemical properties; Recycled aggregates; Structural elements; Technical specifications; Brick",Conference Paper,Scopus

The obtained LAPS composite nanofibers achieved an unprecedented thermal energy storage capacity up to 78.4% of pristine LA because of the high LA loading as well as the lightweight and porous nature of the PS matrix. To the best of our knowledge, our result was higher than the previously reported values, which were generally less than 50%. The direct scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation, IR spectra, Raman spectra, and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) thermograms of LAPS nanofibers indicated that majority of LA was encapsulated inside the composite nanofibers. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns showed that the crystal size of LA domains enlarged with the increase of LA loading in the composite nanofibers. In addition, the DSC run in T4P mode unveiled that the released latent heat during crystallization could raise the temperature of LAPS composite nanofibers above the onset temperature of crystallization, which was different from the reported results obtained from DSC run in traditional T1 mode. Furthermore, the undesirable supercooling effect was suppressed by increasing the percentage of LA in the composite nanofibers. Also, the LAPS composite nanofibers showed robust cycling stability and reusability during 100 continuous heating-cooling cycles in the temperature range of 0-80 °C.

To evaluate structure performance, the static shear loading tests were carried out using new construction and re-construction of mud-walls. Here, the experiment by the re-construction of mud-walls were carried out for the following reasons. Many Japanese traditional wooden building are being maintained by the half dismantling and the partial dismantling for a long time. In consideration of it, the re-construction of mud wall was built by reusing timber. As a result of the experiment, the shear stiffness with the deformation to increase of the mud-wall was quantified. And the authors hypothesized that the result was similar with shear stiffness by the deformation to increase of ""the real-scale timber case study house"" with the mud-wall. At first, the equivalent shear stiffness Km was obtained by substituting the natural period given by the micro tremor measurement into the equation (4). Then, Shear stiffness K1/600 of a story deformation angle 1/600 demands it by multiplying coefficient of correlation β by equivalent shear stiffness Km. The change of structure performance after story deformation angle 1/600 is decided by parameter a, b of the equation of regression based on the experiment. β in this examination uses equivalent shear stiffness ratio β (K1/600/Km) measured at the time of the one-way loading test. The one-way loading test was performed for ""the real-scale timber case study house"" to confirm the validity of method previously described. In addition, it was performed including a free vibration experiment to evaluate dynamic structure performance. The main results obtained from these studies are as follows. From the result of the static shear loading tests, new construction mud-walls and re-construction mud-walls showed equal structure performance. As for the shear stiffness by the increasing transformation of mud-wall, variation becomes small in the large deformation domain. As a result of having performed curve fitting by orthogonal polynomials and least square approximation for the Fourier spectrum, theoretical formula was almost reproducing the measurements. This is indication that natural vibration mode can be estimated by the free vibration test. In addition, although some difference is observed between the free vibration measurements and one-way loading test, the vibration measurements result obtained from the orthogonal polynomials and least square approximation mostly agree with one-way loading test result. If shear stiffness of story deformation angle 1/600 of the target building is provided, the structure performance in the large deformation domain is almost provided. In the present, it has not been quantified about the correlation in micro tremor measurement result of measurement Km and shear stiffness K1/600. However, it is revealed to change in β=0.4-0.6 neighborhood by the study in the past. This was provided by analyzing 14-19) of the precedent study. Therefore it will be necessary to quantify it by building data in future.","In-plane shear test; Re-construction mud-wall; Real scale wooden building; Vibration measurement","Buildings; Curve fitting; Deformation; Least squares approximations; Orthogonal functions; Stiffness; Testing; Timber; Vibration measurement; Wooden buildings; Coefficient of correlation; Free-vibration tests; In-plane shear; Least square approximations; Micro tremor measurements; Orthogonal polynomial; Structure performance; Traditional wooden buildings; Walls (structural partitions)",Article,Scopus

Strong efforts have been made to try new adsorption materials. In this study, activated oxygen-rich porous boron nitride nanosheets (OBNNSs) containing abundant B[sbnd]O bonds and boron atom vacancies were facilely synthesized via simple two-step method. Different from the conventional doping and activation methods, the oxygen dopants and boron atom vacancies in OBNNSs mainly originate from the starting materials and are introduced in situ and chemical activation during the product formation. OBNNSs exhibit high adsorption capacity and adsorption rate for metallic ions due to its unique polarity of B[sbnd]O bonds and boron atom vacancies, surpassing the bulk and activated BN as well as many common adsorbents. Their critical role in the strong adsorption ability of OBNNSs was validated by theoretical calculations. Additionally, the two-dimensional nanostructure of OBNNSs makes most of the B[sbnd]O bonds and boron atom vacancies expose on the surface ((002) plane) and further enhances the adsorption performance. Moreover, the used OBNNSs can be readily regenerated by acidic elution due to the super anti-oxidation, corrosion resistance, and structural stability. Bearing both a high removal efficiency for water pollutants, especially different toxic metallic irons (Pb2+, Cr3+, and Hg2+), and excellent reusability, OBNNSs are very promising nanomaterials for water purification. © 2017","Adsorption energy; Boron nitride nanosheets; Chemical activation; Oxygen-doping; Water purification","Adsorption; Atoms; Boron nitride; Chemical activation; Corrosion resistance; III-V semiconductors; Lead removal (water treatment); Nanosheets; Nitrides; Purification; Reusability; Stability; Water pollution; Water treatment plants; Adsorption energies; Boron nitride nanosheets; High adsorption capacity; Oxygen doping; Structural stabilities; Theoretical calculations; Two-dimensional nanostructures; Water purification; Oxygen vacancies",Article,Scopus

Herein, N-acetyl-l-cysteine modified silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) with negative charges spontaneously and stably resided in the lumen of HNTs via electrostatic interactions. The images of transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy showed that Ag NPs with a size of ~2.6 nm were uniformly distributed in the lumen of HNTs. The catalytic activity of the obtained Ag NPs/HNTs composites was evaluated by the reduction reaction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) as a model reaction. When the molar ratio of Ag and 4-NP was set at 0.008, the rate constant of the reaction was found to be 0.91 min−1, two times higher than that of Ag NPs adsorbed on the external surface of HNTs.

The influence of structural and textural properties of these adsorbents over the CO2 adsorption behaviour was also investigated. The results showed that MgO-based products prepared by solution–combustion and ball-milling processes, were highly porous, fluffy, nanocrystalline structures in nature, which are unique physico-chemical properties that significantly contribute to enhance their CO2 adsorption. It was found that the MgO synthesized by solution combustion process, using a molar ratio of urea to magnesium nitrate (2:1), and treated by ball-milling during 2.5 hr (MgO-BM2.5h), exhibited the maximum CO2adsorption capacity of 1.611 mmol/g at 25°C and 1 atm, mainly via chemisorption. The CO2 adsorption behaviour on the MgO-based adsorbents was correlated to their improved specific surface area, total pore volume, pore size distribution and crystallinity. The reusability of synthesized MgO-BM2.5h was confirmed by five consecutive CO2 adsorption–desorption times, without any significant loss of performance, that supports the potential of MgO-based adsorbent.

The current work focuses on the behaviour of structural normal steel (hot rolled and cold formed) as well as high strength bolts after exposure to elevated temperatures.

Design/methodology/approach: Due to the complexity of the issue, an elaborate presentation of the mechanical properties' influencing factors is followed. Subsequently, a wide range of experimental studies is extensively reviewed in the literature while simplified equations for determining the post-fire mechanical properties are proposed, following appropriate categorisation. Moreover, the reinstatement survey is also comprehensively described. Findings: Useful conclusions are drawn for the safe reuse of the structural elements and connection components. According to the parametric investigation of the aforementioned data, it can be safely concluded that the most common scenario of buildings after fire events, i.e. apart from excessively distorted structures, implies considerable remaining capacity of the structure, highlighting that subsequent demolition should not be the case, especially regarding critical infrastructure and buildings.

A laboratory assessment undertaken in this research shows that wood chips are suitable as a non-structural embankment fill material, but not as a pipe backfilling material. This research also presents the environmental benefits of using wood chips in natural landscaping and the effects of filter depth in such applications. It is found that wood chips significantly trap total suspended solids (TSS) and total nitrogen (TN), contributing to increased total phosphorus (TP) concentration. As such the use of such material in urban landscaping should be subjective depending on the level of concerns for specific pollutant(s) (TSS, TN and TP).

Here, we report the production of graphene-oxide-based hydrophobic PAN/GO nanofibers using electrospinning technique for photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine 6G dye under natural sunlight illumination. The synthesized nanofibers were characterized using X-ray diffraction, EDX, field emission scanning electron microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy. Dye removal efficiency was investigated by monitoring UV–Vis absorption intensity over time. Structural change in dye was studied using FTIR analysis. Kinetics of dye degradation reaction was monitored through pseudo-first-order and pseudo-second-order kinetics model. Effects of nanofiber weight and initial dye concentration on the degradation efficiency were investigated in detail. Reusability and stability of these synthesized nanofibers in dye solution have been studied using scanning electron microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy. A comparative study for dye degradation was also performed using TiO2-coated nanofibers under visible light and UV light illumination. These large-area reusable graphene oxide nanofibers provide a scalable and novel route for photocatalytic degradation of carcinogenic dyes from industrial water. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",,"Degradation; Efficiency; Electron microscopy; Field emission microscopes; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Light; Nanofibers; Photocatalysis; Reaction kinetics; Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; X ray diffraction; Degradation efficiency; Electrospinning techniques; Environmental hazards; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Initial dye concentration; Photo catalytic degradation; Photocatalytic activities; Pseudo second order kinetics; Graphene",Article,Scopus

The common approach to the development of methodologies for water purification is to search for excellent materials with optimised chemical compositions and unique structural dimension. Here a facile chemical approach has been developed for the synthesis of microsheets of chlorine interlayer ZnAl layered double hydroxides (Cl-ZnAl LDHs) hexagonal nanoplates by simply varying the molar ratio of salts precursors in the presence of hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA). The possible formation mechanism of microsheets of Cl-ZnAl LDHs hexagonal nanoplates has been described on the basis of different characterization. The prepared unique structural microsheets exhibited ultrafast adsorption rates and high adsorption capacities in the removal of anionic methyl orange (MO) dye and Cr(VI) ions from aqueous solution. The adsorption isotherms, kinetics models and mechanisms for Cr(VI) ions and MO onto Cl-ZnAl LDHs were also investigated in detail. The high uptake capability, reusability and ultrafast kinetics make Cl-ZnAl LDHs unique structural microsheets a potentially attractive low-cost adsorbent for the efficient removal of metal ions and toxic dye from contaminated water. Furthermore, the simple synthesis strategy might be envisaged for another type of LDHs, and consequently, a variety of applications can target due to their specific structural dimensions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

One underexploited option to reduce embodied carbon is the reuse of structural steel. However, in the UK, work by Sansom and Avery (2014) suggests a picture of declining levels of reuse. This paper explores why this is the case by identifying the practical barriers to structural steel reuse through a series of semi-structured interviews with UK construction industry members. Whilst there were many identified barriers, five practical barriers were prioritised as being most significant: cost, availability/storage, no client demand, traceability and supply chain gaps/lack of integration. These contrast with those most commonly identified in global literature: cost, supply chain gaps/integration, risk, jointing technique, composite construction and time for deconstruction; with only two overlaps: cost and supply chain gaps/integration. Many of the barriers from literature have a technical focus (reducing salvage yield rather than completely preventing reuse) differing from the largely systemic barriers that the interviews prioritised. These systemic barriers will need to be dealt with first to increase reuse rates. This will require a coordinated approach across the UK construction supply chain. Building on interview insights, this paper proposes four mechanisms to overcome these systemic barriers: (1) the creation of a database of suppliers/reused section availability, (2) a demonstration of client demand (3) technical guidance and education for the construction industry and (4) government leadership. Together these mechanisms would improve reuse rates in the UK, reduce the embodied emissions of the built environment and play a crucial role in meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Circular economy; Construction; Embodied carbon; Steel reuse; Sustainability","Building materials; Concrete slabs; Construction; Construction industry; Costs; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Steel construction; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Barriers; Circular economy; Composite construction; Embodied carbons; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Semi structured interviews; Technical guidances; UK construction industry; Gas emissions",Article,Scopus

A simple analytical model for the BMJ mechanism is derived and verified with finite element model simulation results for a variety of capped column geometric configurations.

Wood can be a material with high sustainable rates because it is recyclable, reusable and naturally renewable. Moreover, its excellent strength-to-weight ratios, thermal insulating and acoustical properties make it useful for different kinds of applications in buildings, ranging from structural beams and frames, insulating envelopes, windows, door frames, to wall and flooring materials and furniture. Although wood is commonly classified as a sustainable material, its real sustainability depends on different issues: appropriate forest management, manufacturing methods and site assembly, distance required for transportation and use of glues. Wood has also good seismic performances due to its lightweight and even if timber elements are not able to have a ductile behavior, using steel connection allows to build dissipative structure, as well platform frame and X-LAM panels systems. Insulation properties are related to low thermal conductivity values. Furthermore, wooden elements can be used to minimize sound transmission and they can be employed as sustainable materials as several Life Cycle Assessment studies demonstrate.

In spite of the potential benefits, and in a time when “sustainability” and “climate change” are critical societal issues, the question arises: why are greater rates of structural steel reuse not being observed? One of the major factors in the rate of structural steel reuse is how decision-makers understand the life cycle implications of their choice to recycle steel rather than reuse it. This paper contributes towards our understanding of these implications, particularly the cost implications, of reuse as an alternative to recycling by presenting a streamlined life cycle analysis and identifying the major contributors to each process. The results of a case study indicate that a significant reduction in some life cycle impact metrics (greenhouse gas emissions, water use) can result from reusing structural steel rather than recycling it. The largest contributors to the life cycle impact of recycling were the shredding, melting, and forming sub-processes. The largest contributor to reuse was the deconstruction sub-process. A total life cycle cost analysis is performed to understand the cost of damages to the environment and human health in combination with the cost of construction activities. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are also conducted to quantify variability in the results and determine economic conditions where the two processes have an equal cost. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Construction; Deconstruction; Life cycle analysis; Life cycle costing; Recycling; Reuse; Structural steel","construction method; cost analysis; decision making; economic conditions; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; recycling; steel; sustainability",Article,Scopus

The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns confirmed the high crystal quality along the 〈101〉 direction and is consistent with the hexagonal wurtzite structure of ZnO.

The thermopower wave (TW), which produces a high specific power during the combustion of solid fuel inside micro-nanostructure materials, is a unique energy source for unusual platforms that cannot use conventional energy sources. Here, we report on the significant enhancement of hybrid energy generation of pyroelectrics and thermoelectrics from TWs in carbon nanotube (CNT)-PZT (lead zirconate titanate, P(Z0.5-T0.5)) composites for the first time. Conventional TWs use only charge carrier transport driven by the temperature gradient along the core materials to produce voltage. In this study, a core-shell structure of CNTs-PZTs was prepared to utilize both the temperature gradient along the core material (thermoelectrics) and the dynamic change in the temperature of the shell structure (pyroelectrics) induced by TWs. The dual mechanism of energy generation in CNT-PZT composites amplified the average peak and duration of the voltage up to 403 mV and 612 ms, respectively, by a factor of 2 and 60 times those for the composites without a PZT layer. Furthermore, dynamic voltage measurements and structural analysis in repetitive TWs confirmed that CNT-PZT composites maintain the original performance in multiple TWs, which improves the reusability of materials. The advanced TWs obtained by the application of a PZT layer as a pyroelectric material contributes to the extension of the usable energy portion as well as the development of TW-based operating devices. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","carbon nanotube; combustion; pyroelectricity; PZT; thermopower wave","Carrier transport; Combustion; Coremaking; Crystallography; Ferroelectric ceramics; Fuels; Lead zirconate titanate; Pyroelectricity; Reusability; Shells (structures); Thermal gradients; Thermoelectric power; Yarn; Combustion of solid fuels; Conventional energy sources; Core shell structure; Dynamic changes; Energy generations; Micro-nano structures; Operating devices; Pyroelectric materials; Carbon nanotubes",Article,Scopus

Firm M can take advantage of its modular production technology and product return policy. For such a consumer-driven demand setting, we develop a model and solve to optimality a single-stage, non-cooperative game where both firms simultaneously set their competitive prices. In addition to analytical expressions for the optimal prices and the profits for both firms, we provide structural results and numerical examples to render practical insights: The refund rate has a strong impact on profits; sensitivity of product greenness can be increased by conscientious advertising, and the reusability of modular parts encourages lower pricing and higher market share.

However, the few vehicles that were built until now for lunar missions were far from having the capability to achieve this goal. Their designs were mainly influenced by short term considerations and the available technological state of the art. Consequently relying on a classic expendable transportation system based on storable propellant will not allow going much further than where we arrived until today. A new transportation architecture is needed. In the frame of the ROBEX (Robotic Exploration under Extreme Conditions) project, new types of lunar architecture are under study. Modularity, reconfigurability and flexibility are playing a major role. The transportation system is of course a very important aspect of future Moon missions, as it can represent a very large share of the mass to be launched from Earth. Reducing the share of the lunar transportation system within the total mass launched from Earth is the best way to reduce the cost of Moon missions and therefore increase the overall programme sustainability. The preliminary design of a Moon transportation system based on reusable vehicles running on LOx/LH2 and benefiting from lunar in-situ propellant production is being performed. This transportation system is made out of two types of vehicle. The Reusable Lunar Resupply Vehicle (RLRV) is a lunar single stage to orbit vehicle able also to land on the Moon. The Reusable Trans- Lunar Vehicle (RTLV) is a space-tug able to transport payloads from LEO to a cis-lunar orbit and back. Several cislunar orbits are considered and their influence on the RLRV and RTLV designs is discussed. Possible vehicle cooperation, such as in-space cryogenic propellant transfer is also studied. For both vehicles, a structural preliminary sizing is performed. For the RLRV in particular, the landing dynamic has been analysed to refine the landing loads. Based on these results, the potential gain brought by reusability to the Lunar transportation system is demonstrated for different cis-lunar staging orbits and operational modes.

DLR is performing an extensive study on return methods for a reusable booster stage for a future launch vehicle. The present study focuses on the vertical take-off and vertical landing (VTOL) method. First, a restitution of a flight of Falcon 9 is presented in order to assess the accuracy of the tools used. Then, the preliminary designs of different variants of a future Ariane launch vehicle with a reusable VTOL booster stage are described. The proposed launch vehicle is capable of launching a seven ton satellite into a geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) from the European spaceport in Kourou. Different stagings and propellants (LOx/LH2, LOx/LCH4, LOx/LC3H8, subcooled LOx/LCH4) are considered, evaluated and compared. First sizing of a broad range of launcher versions are based on structural index derived from existing stages. Ascent and descent trajectories of the first stage are optimized together in order to reach the highest payload while keeping mechanical loads at reasonable levels. Another important aspect is the aerothermal environment stressing the structure. During the re-entry boost, the first stage is immersed in the engine exhaust plume. Steady state computational fluid dynamics calculations are performed along the re-entry trajectory to characterise the flow field during retro-propulsion around the first stage. The resulting aerothermal database is coupled with a simple structural model to study the time dependent heating of the hull structure. Based on these first iteration results more detailed preliminary designs are performed in a second iteration for selected configurations: a LOx/LH2 launcher and a LOx/LCH4 launcher both equipped with gas generator engines.

Time-consuming nature of detailed Building Energy Modelling (BEM) has introduced simplified BEM and metamodels within the design process. The paper further elaborates the limitations of this method and proposes a component-based Machine Learning Modelling (MLM) approach which could potentially overcome the current limitations. The paper proposes a methodology for developing component-based MLM that generalise well. Generalisation, in this paper, refers to the reusability of an MLM developed with data from a specific situation in similar circumstances. As a first step in ongoing research on component-based MLM, a model is developed with data from a simple box building with weather data of Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris and two occupancy profiles. It is shown that the MLM is able to predict the annual energy for (1) same box building under different weather conditions not included in the training data (2) different dimensions of the box building for one case weather data and occupancy. The prediction error for annual heating demand is lower than 10% for all evaluated cases while the prediction error for annual cooling demand ranges -3.4% to 28.3%. Good generalisation is observed for all heating energy predictions whereas only for a few cooling energy predictions.

This paper aims to investigate the demountability of steel column-baseplate connections under monotonic loading. The effects of material and geometric nonlinearities were included in the developed model. It is demonstrated that the developed finite element model can accurately predict the initial stiffness, ultimate bending moment capacity of steel column-baseplate connections.

Modification of the framebased model of knowledge that allows description of knowledge about structures of data and interaction processes is considered. The essence of modification is to extend the frame with descriptions of a totality of methods, associated with a frame as a whole, as well as descriptions of interfaces of a frame. This modification also makes it possible in a formalized way to describe the problem of automated synthesis of IS information and software as a set of one-to-one mappings of frame descriptions. Theoretical-multiple models of structural IS requirements design patterns at the knowledge level were developed. These models allow describing the knowledge, derived from IS requirements descriptions in the form of a network of frames. This network consists of individual frames, interfaces of frames and relationships between them. The use of these models makes it possible to formalize the process of designing of IS architecture based on knowledge, derived from IS requirements descriptions, which significantly reduces the time spent on IS creation. Theoretical-multiple models of behavioral IS requirements design patterns at the knowledge level were developed. These models establish the main features of operations of addition, modifications and deletion of elements of structural IS requirements design patterns. In addition, developed models describe operations on formation of knowledge-oriented descriptions of IS architecture in the form of a network of frames and interfaces. Application of these models enables us to standardize implementation of operations on the knowledge, derived from patterns, and on patterns of designing structural frames.

Those functions suggest the components that it must have, usually chosen from a pre-defined set. Also, structural elements must be added, based on project and manufacture requirements, so the cable can withstand the environmental conditions of use. All the components must be geometrically arranged and the cross section of the cable must be defined, usually with the help of CAD software. But the structural behavior of the designed cable must be analyzed under several environmental conditions, using numerical and analytical tools. If this behavior does not fulfill the desired structural requirements, the cable must be redesigned: structural and functional components must be changed and the cross section of the umbilical must be rearranged in an iterative process. This article presents an environment that integrates a CAD tool dedicated to the design of the cross section of an umbilical cable with structural analysis tools, both analytical (Utilflex) and numerical (UFLEX2D). The CAD tool architecture is based on a component-instance model that enables both drawing and reusing of components. It also can export the designed crosssection to AutoCAD using AutoLISP language.

Even if surviving earthquakes with minimal probability of collapse, these structures might suffer so much damage, that their repair costs would be prohibitive. Strategies for limiting the building's damaged zones to specific parts (or “fuses”) can reduce repair costs. However, the replaceable part is limited to a small portion of the structure, whereas the rest cannot be disassembled. This is an issue for structures whose life span depends more likely on economics rather than on structural performances. Therefore, making them easily disassembled would be an advantage not only in seismic areas but also in any industrialized area. The purpose of this paper is to explore the “Design for Disassembly” (DfD) approach to complement seismic design and find a compromise between them. Design/methodology/approach: In this work, one single type of structures was analysed (the moment-resisting frame), focusing on the design of a “disassemblable” seismic-resistant steel connection. The design process involved several iterations until an “optimum” compromise between seismic design and DfD was met. Findings: This study shows that a compromise between seismic design and DfD is possible. In this case, the compromise was achieved at the expenses of more complex design calculations and a greater number of components than standard connections. However, this would be compensated for by a higher residual value for the entire structure. Originality/value: Eventually, it was proved that a metric for assessing DfD steel connections is possible, but structural analyses are needed to validate it. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Design for disassembly; Design for repair; Resilience; Reuse; Steel structures’ sustainability; Sustainable construction","architectural design; building; industrial location; joint; recycling; repair; resilience; seismic design; steel",Article,Scopus

The reductions of different organic dyes (4-nitrophenol, rhodamine B and methylene blue) by borohydride ions were used as model catalytic reactions. The catalytic performance of the Au NCs ranged between 3.6 to 110 nm was found to be dependent on crystal size, indicating that Au surface atoms have a distinct size-dependent reactivity in this reaction. Similarly, the catalytic performance was found to be strongly dependent on the nature of the coating molecule, obtaining lower catalytic activities for molecules strongly bound to the Au surface. Finally, the catalytic performance was found to be dependent on the chemical composition of the NC (Au, Ag, Pt) and the model dye used as a testing system, with the highest degradation rate found for methylene blue, followed by 4-nitrophenol and rhodamine B.

Beside, most of the towns in dense populated environment do not grow anymore to their outskirts, but are redeveloped on their existing area. Consequently buildings of the last decades are replaced by modern buildings with sustainable and architectural appealing design. Hereby the deconstruction and the management of construction and demolition waste of the existing buildings is a key issue in the development of sustainable construction. Prevention, re-use and recycling are the basic approaches to waste management. This contribution introduces waste management in reference to demolition techniques. In particular different demolition methods are presented for the main structural typologies and materials. Also the factors relevant to the choice of the demolition technique and its influence on the eventual recovery of materials are investigated. Recycling is not only a question of the total costs of a deconstruction, but also depends on the fractions of the materials, which do not all permit recycling. Besides, options for the future are discussed. Typical buildings at their end-of-lifetime today were not constructed in the past with any thoughts on possibilities of later reuse of materials or structures. But even today, the deconstruction as one possible strategy at the end-of-lifetime is not deeply investigated. Thus, this paper focuses as well on the question, whether we can reach zero-waste deconstruction techniques in the near future or not. But even if we could, what additional possibilities exist today for concrete-gravel or other recycling products? Especially in high populated areas of Europe the amount of recycled concrete or masonry coming from deconstruction projects is about twice as much as the need for recycled material e.g. as an alternative to natural gravel. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Buildings; Concrete products; Concretes; Demolition; Gravel; Life cycle; Recycling; Sustainable development; Annual cost; Construction and demolition waste; Modern buildings; Recycled concretes; Recycled materials; Recycling products; Structural typologies; Sustainable construction; Waste management",Conference Paper,Scopus

Therefore, this paper investigates the role of building information modeling (BIM) for that purpose. Based on a review of literature, a preliminary decision making framework is proposed that will be elaborated in the nearby future. The literature review revealed that the use of BIM in combination with other digital technologies looks promising, but that additional research is needed into the governance related aspects of BIM. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Building components; Buildings; Construction industry; Decision making; Information management; Life cycle; Building Information Model - BIM; Decision-making frameworks; Digital technologies; Literature reviews; Non-structural; Virgin materials; Architectural design",Conference Paper,Scopus

In this work, firstly, carbonized pollen grain (PG) containing biological structure was prepared with rapeseed flower by the removing impurities, dehydration and calcinations. The morphologies of the synthesized PG show that they are ellipsoidal and hollow particles with length of ca. 30 μm, and pollen shell has a uniform network structure with an average pore size of 1.5 μm. Cross-sectional image of PG shows a palisade-like shell with the thickness of about 1 μm and vast pore canals. Outstanding BET surface area (379.98 m2 g−1) is achieved. Secondly, hydrophobic pollen grain (HPG) was prepared with PG by the surface activation and vinyltriethoxysilane (A151) modification under microwave-treated technique. The static contact angle for deionized water on HPG is 132°, indicating its excellent hydrophobic nature. Furthermore, a series of 3D hydrophobic composite resins (HCR) network decorated with different HPG content were prepared by the method of suspension polymerization under microwave conditions and benzoperoxide as initiator. Enhancing absorption capacities of 16.8 and 58.8 g g−1 to oils and organic solvents, respectively, are achieved. Pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion kinetic models were employed for the corresponding organic solvents and oil absorption. This work represents a low cost, clean, and efficient route to prepare hydrophobic composite resin for absorption of oils and organic solvents with high performance, including absorption capacity, excellent selective separation performance on immiscible oil-water mixtures, good structural stability and reusability. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","3D network polymer; Absorption; Biological structure; Hydrophobic composite resins; Rapeseed flower","Absorption; Carbon; Contact angle; Deionized water; Hydrophobicity; Oilseeds; Organic solvents; Pore size; Resins; Reusability; Stability; 3D networks; Biological structures; Composite resins; Cross sectional image; Intra-particle diffusion; Rapeseed flower; Structural stabilities; Suspension polymerization; Water absorption",Article,Scopus

The catalytic activity was improved when SBA-15 framework was modified by adding Al and Ga. Structural and textural characterization of the catalysts were performed by means of XRD, N2 adsorption, UV–Vis–DRS, XPS, NMR, TEM, Raman, TPR and Py-FTIR. UV–Vis–DRS and Raman demonstrated that highly dispersed vanadium VO4−3 species are responsible for the high activity in the sulfur removal. The Ga modified support with an intermediate V/Si ratio of 1/30 was the most active catalyst for ODS of DBT, using hydrogen peroxide as oxidant and acetonitrile as solvent. 100% of DBT elimination was attained at a short time in mild conditions. Gallium and aluminum incorporation into the support modified successfully the nature of the SBA-15 surface by generating Bronsted and Lewis acidity. The interaction between the acid sites with the active vanadium sites improved the activity of the catalysts. The high dispersion depended on the vanadium loading and on the nature of the support. The more acidic support allowed better dispersion of the vanadium species due to stronger interaction metal-support.

The CoFe-LDH/CF serves as a cathode as well as a Fe2+ (catalyst) source in the electro-Fenton (EF) process. A combined structural and electrochemical characterization revealed highly ordered and well crystallized CoFe-LDH anisotropically grown on a CF substrate with highly dense urchin-like structures that were highly stable at circumneutral pH. EF experiments with the CoFe-LDH/CF cathode showed excellent mineralization of Acid Orange II (AO7) over a wide pH range (2-7.1). The mineralization of AO7 with CoFe-LDH/CF was by both homogeneous and surface-catalyzed processes at low acidic pH, whereas only the surface-catalyzed process occurs at circumneutral pH due to the stability of the LDH as well as precipitation of the catalyst. Higher mineralization was achieved with CoFe-LDH/CF compared to homogeneous EF with raw CF using the Fe2+/Co2+ catalyst at all pH values studied and the TOC removal with the CoFe-LDH/CF cathode was at least 1.7 and 3.5 times higher than that with the homogeneous system with Fe2+/Co2+ at pH 5.83 and 7.1, respectively. The enhanced performance observed with CoFe-LDH/CF was ascribed to (i) the surface-catalyzed reaction occurring at the surface of the cathode which can expand the working pH window, avoiding the precipitation of iron sludge as pH increases, (ii) enhanced generation of H2O2 due to the improved electroactive surface area of the cathode and (iii) the co-catalyst effect of the Co2+ in the LDH that can promote regeneration and additional production of Fe2+ and the hydroxyl radical, respectively. The CoFe-LDH/CF cathode exhibited relatively good reusability as the TOC removal after 2 h was still above 60% after 7 cycles of degradation, indicating that the prepared CoFe-LDH/CF is a promising cathode for the removal of organic pollutants by EF technology. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Catalysis; Catalysts; Electrodes; Felt; Mineralogy; Organic pollutants; Oxidation; pH; Reusability; Surface reactions; Electro-Fenton process; Electroactive surface areas; Electrochemical characterizations; Heterogeneous catalyst; Layered double hydroxides; Solvothermal growth; Surface-catalyzed reactions; Urchin-like structures; Cathodes",Article,Scopus

However, because the headed stud shear connectors are welded onto the top flange of the steel beam and cast into the in situ concrete slab, deconstruction of the composite beam and the reuse of its components at the end of structural life in defence to demolition is virtually impossible, which is at odds with the increasing demands placed on improving the sustainability of building infrastructure. As an alternative, an innovative sustainable composite beam and slab system is proposed, in which precast geopolymer concrete panels are attached to the steel beams using high-strength friction-grip bolts instead of cast in situ floors with pre-welded headed stud connectors. The advantages of a low-carbon design, both by the use of geopolymer concrete elements and system deconstructability, can be achieved in this proposed system. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model is developed to investigate the structural behaviour of the proposed sustainable composite beam and slab system. Material non-linearities and the interaction of the structural components are included in the model. The accuracy and reliability of the finite element formulation developed are validated by comparisons with experimental results. Extensive parametric studies are conducted to elucidate the effects of the change in the concrete panel configuration, the number and diameter of the bolts, the type and strength of the concrete and the grade of the steel beam on the behaviour of the system.

Changes in materials, products, designs, and methodologies are occurring to accommodate this green progression. While these changes have energy and environmental benefits, questions have been raised about impacts on fire safety. There are two major reasons to consider the nexus of fire safety and sustainable design. First is a concern for the environment and how a building fire would cause environmental harm. It is possible that a single fire event can negate several, if not all, elements of green design. Second is a concern that sustainable design features will cause unintended increased fire risk or hazards. Sustainable design is a relatively new market with some unconventional materials, techniques, and features that have not yet been proven with time, which introduces risk of unintentional consequences. Moving forward, it would be valuable to integrate green design with fire safety such that they reinforce rather than undermine each other. This article seeks to examine the relationship between fire safety and sustainability in buildings, discuss the status of the fire and sustainability communities, and recommend avenues for development and implementation to promote fire-safe sustainable designs. Such avenues include incorporating greywater and rainwater reuse systems with fire sprinklers, fire alerts and controls in building automation systems, better safety mechanisms and designs for on-site energy production and storage, and less combustible and more resilient structural elements and insulation. © 2016, Springer International Publishing AG.","Fire safety; Green design; Insulation; Life cycle assessment; Rooftop solar; Sustainable building","Automation; Ecodesign; Fires; Hose; Intelligent buildings; Wastewater reclamation; Building fires; Environmental benefits; Fire sprinklers; On-site energy; Safety mechanisms; Structural elements; Sustainability communities; Sustainable building; Sustainable development",Review,Scopus

Initially, we have prepared a series of catalysts with different Si/Ti atomic ratios (80, 75, 70, 60, and 50) as well as (Si+Ti)/Cr ratios (8, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30) and investigated their visible light photocatalytic activity. The effect of the Si and Cr atoms on the structural, optical, and photocatalytic properties of TiO2 has been investigated. Our XRD studies reveal that the (Si+Ti)/Cr ratios and Si/Ti atomic ratios alter the TiO2 lattice structure, with an increase in the Si ratio in the catalyst reduction of the rutile phase being observed. An increase in the Si/Ti atomic ratio from 50 to 75 monotonically transformed the rutile phase into the anatase phase. Introduction of Cr induced a substantial amount of disorder into the TiO2 lattice and altered the crystallinity. A high amount of Cr in the catalyst led to the transition from the tetrahedral coordination of CrO3 to the hexagonal coordination of Cr2O3 oxide and implies the segregation of chromium out of the TiO2 lattice. Dropping the Cr amount (an increase in the (Si +Ti)/Cr atomic ratio) to within solubility limits would solve the difficulties accompanying Cr2O3 segregation out of TiO2. The addition of SiO2 into the titania lattice greatly promoted the surface texture by enhancing the surface area by four times the commercial TiO2. The introduction of Cr extended the visible light absorption of the catalyst to 550 nm. Our H2-TPR results suggest that the increase in the Si/Ti atomic ratio greatly promoted the suppression of the Cr2O3 phase in the catalyst along with an increase in reduction potential of Cr6+. It is found in our studies that Cr has an imperative role in the photocatalytic activity, while the SiO2 was found to be responsible for the stability of the photocatalyst. We have observed that the optimal flame-made Cr/Ti/Si catalyst demonstrated an extremely low level of Cr and Ti leaching throughout the photocatalytic degradation reaction, therefore inhibiting the contamination of the treated wastewater due to secondary metal leaching. We observed a stable Cr(IV) concentration for the reused catalyst, which plays an important role in improved and stable photocatalytic activity in the visible region for the materials. Unlike the Cr/TiO2 systems, the optimal flame-made Cr/Ti/Si catalyst established high efficiency in visible photocatalysis, stability, and reusability without any Cr leaching even after five consecutive cycles.

The material is usually obtained by a wet chemical method using ZrO(NO3)2 or (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O and C8H6S as precursors. The structural features of obtained materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermal analysis (TG-DTA), N2 adsorption-desorption, and photoluminescence (PL). The influence on the photocatalytic activity of the MoS2 cocatalyst concentration with ZrO2 nanoparticles was studied. The MZr-2 hybrid sample had the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange (MO), which was 8.45 times higher than that of pristine ZrO2 ascribed to high specific surface area and absorbance efficiency. Recycling experiments revealed that the reusability of the MZr-2 hybrid was due to the low photocorrosive effect and good catalytic stability. PL spectra confirmed the electronic interaction between ZrO2 and MoS2. The photoinduced electrons could be easily transferred from CB of ZrO2 to the MoS2 cocatalyst, which facilitate effective charge separation and enhanced the photocatalytic degradation in the UV region. A photocatalytic mechanism is proposed. It is believed that the ZrO2/MoS2 hybrid structure has promise as a photocatalyst with low cost and high efficiency for photoreactions.

The TNTs were produced using a hydrothermal approach and, after being submitted to an Ag + exchange process, metallic Ag nanoparticles were obtained over the nanotubes surface. The prepared materials were structural, morphological and optical characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, micro X-ray fluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, diffused reflectance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The characterization results indicate that Ag + was immobilized not only in the nanotubes external surface but mainly in the TiO 6 interlayers space. The application of this new nanocomposite material on photocatalytic degradation of pollutants was investigated. First, the evaluation of hydroxyl radical formation, using the terephthalic acid as a probe was studied. The photocatalytic activity of the sensitized materials for phenol degradation was afterwards evaluated. The results show that the nanocomposite sample is the best catalyst, achieving 98.0% photodegradation efficiency of a 0.2 mM phenol solution within 20 min under UV-vis radiation. The reusability of the prepared samples as photocatalysts was evaluated in four successive degradation assays, using fresh phenol solutions. The sensitized sample demonstrated excellent catalytic reusability ability, without loss of photochemical stability. The structural and morphological characterization during these experiments revealed no modifications on the nanotubes morphology but a continuous increase on the Ag nanoparticles, in number and size, with the irradiation time. A mechanism for this continuous growth of the Ag nanoparticles, together with the phenol catalytic photodegradation, over the nanotubes surface, is proposed and discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, application of AMF resulted in uniform heating within the nanosorbents (after being magnetically separated from the contaminated water) and triggered toluene desorption/evaporation, leading to accelerated release of pollutants from the nanosorbent, improving its reusability; even after seven cycles the removal efficiency was quite high (83%). © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Magnetic hyperthermia; Magnetic nanoparticle; Nanosorbent; Remediation; Toluene","Chemical analysis; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hyperthermia therapy; Magnetic moments; Magnetism; Nanoparticles; Pollution; Remediation; Remote control; Reusability; Silicones; Solutions; Toluene; Water pollution; Water recycling; Water treatment; X ray diffraction analysis; Alternating magnetic field; Detection of pollutant; Magnetic characteristic; Magnetic hyperthermia; Magnetic nano-particles; Nanosorbent; Thermal heating effects; Vibrating sample magnetometry; Nanomagnetics",Article,Scopus

However, most of the existing studies assume that the spectrum buyers' demands are homogeneous and the interference relationship is fixed without any change with the variation of spectrum. Furthermore, the economical efficiency of auction outcome has not drawn enough attention. That motivates us to design an auction scheme to jointly consider the multi-demand of buyers, heterogeneous spectrum, and economical efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel overlapping coalition formation-based double auction, called VERACITY, to address this problem. The auctioneer groups the conflict free buyers into the same coalition and allows a buyer to join multiple coalitions based on the heterogeneous demand. Dynamic overlapping coalition formation implemented by the auctioneer is to find the approximately optimal coalition structure corresponding to the economical efficiency outcome, i.e., maximizing the social welfare. Furthermore, we prove that VERACITY is individually rational, budget balanced, truthful, and economically efficient. Simulation results are presented to show the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed VERACITY. © 2016 IEEE.","Double auction; economic property; heterogeneous demand; overlapping coalition game; spectrum reusability","Budget control; Efficiency; Reusability; Structural optimization; Coalition formations; Coalition game; Double auction; Economical efficiency; Effective solution; Heterogeneous demand; Optimal coalition; Spectrum auctions; Sales",Article,Scopus

(2012) and the theory of collective enactment of values of Chen et al. (2013). Using the results of a large scale survey of free reuse groups (e.g. Freecycle and Freegle), which enable collaborative forms of consumption, we apply the conceptual model to explore how participants' values are mobilised and expressed. We show that while the majority of free reuse group participants do hold significantly stronger self-transcendence (i.e. pro-social) values than the wider UK population, they also hold other values in common with that population and a minority actually place less emphasis on self-transcendence values.

The physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the developed materials were investigated. To investigate the thermal performance experimentally, two small-scale models were developed over the study area. A two-room model (M1) built with fly ash brick, double-glazed (plain glass) windows with UV rejection film (W1) and a conventional reinforced cement concrete roof was compared with another two-room model (M2) built with construction waste bricks, double-glazed (commercial glass) windows with UV rejection film (W2) and a reinforced cement concrete roof that underwent a reflecting/insulating treatment. The results showed that the thermal transmittance of the wall and the roof of model M2 was reduced by 73% and 25% respectively compared with the wall and roof of model M1. Temperature analyses revealed that the west and east rooms of M2 were respectively 2·3% and 5·0% cooler than those of M1.","Recycling & reuse of materials; Sustainability; Thermal effects","Brick; Building materials; Cements; Concretes; Construction; Fly ash; Glass; Intelligent buildings; Reinforcement; Sustainable development; Thermal conductivity; Thermal effects; Walls (structural partitions); Waste treatment; Development and applications; Double-glazed window; Low thermal conductivity; Mechanical and thermal properties; Reinforced cement concretes; Sustainable building; Sustainable building materials; Thermal transmittance; Roofs",Conference Paper,Scopus

One such ‘green’ construction material is lime hemp concrete (LHC), hemp concrete or hempcrete, which are some of the many names of this novel construction material. Hemp concrete is essentially a composite made of lime and hemp shivs. This paper presents a literature review of the various studies carried out on hemp concrete to understand its properties, drawbacks and advantages in construction. The review dwells on discussion of hemp, use of lime as a binder material and the mechanical, thermal and hygric properties of LHC. The salient features of LHC with regard to mechanical, thermal and hygric properties and ecological impact are discussed in the paper. It is observed that further research on LHC is required to be able to establish mix design principles, improve the compressive and flexural strengths of LHC and its use as a load-bearing structural material for high-rise constructions and establish cradle-to-death GHG emissions, recyclability and reusability which seem to be promising propositions with hemp concrete. © 2016, ICE Publishing.

The crystal phase structure of this unique natural material presents a 1-dimensional (1D) nanowire-like geometry, which is transformed from amorphous to crystalline (hematite) by thermal annealing at high temperature without changing their morphology. This study systematically assesses the effect of different annealing temperatures on the photocatalytic activity of iron oxide nanowires produced by Mariprofundus ferrooxydans bacteria. The nanowires processed at 800 °C were the most optimal for photocatalytic applications degrading a model dye (rhodamine B) in less than an hour. These nanowires displayed excellent reusability with no significant loss of activity even after 6 cycles. Kinetic studies by using hydrogen peroxide (radical generator) and isopropyl alcohol (radical scavenger) suggest that OH• is the dominant photooxidant.

It consumes more than half of the total global resources; it is responsible for more than a third of the total global energy use and associated emissions; and generates the greatest and most voluminous waste stream globally. Reuse is considered to be a material and carbon saving practice highly recommended in the construction sector as it can address both waste and carbon emission regulatory targets. This practice offers the possibility to conserve resources through the reclamation of structural components and the carbon embedded in them, as well as opportunities for the development of new business models and the creation of environmental, economic, technical and social value. This paper focuses on the identification and analysis of existing interventions that can promote the reuse of construction components, and outlines the barriers and opportunities arising from this practice as depicted from the global literature. The main conclusions that derive from this study are that the combination of incentives that promote reuse of construction components and recycling of the rest of the construction materials with the provision of specialised education, skills and training would transform the way construction sector currently operates and create opportunities for new business development. Moreover, a typology system developed based on the properties and lifetime of construction components is required in order to provide transparency and guidance in the way construction components are used and reused, in order to make them readily available to designers and contractors. Smart technologies carry the potential to aid the development and uptake of this system by enabling efficient tracking, storage and archiving, while providing information relevant to the environmental and economic savings that can be regained, enabling also better decision-making during construction and deconstruction works. However, further research is required in order to investigate the opportunities and constraints of the use of these technologies. © 2015 The Authors.","Construction and demolition waste (CDW); Construction components; Infrastructure; Interventions; Reuse","Construction industry; Decision making; Demolition; Construction and demolition waste; Construction sectors; Infrastructure; Interventions; New business development; New business models; Reuse; Structural component; Environmental technology; construction; demolition; infrastructure; recycling; structural component; waste; building industry; building material; commercial phenomena; construction work; cost control; decision making; environmental health; environmental protection; priority journal; professional development; recycling; Review; solid waste management; technology",Review,Scopus

The slip-form method, which is a typical moving form method, has advantages such as reduced construction duration and simple components because it enables continuous forming work of concrete in a single construction. However, it is vulnerable to corrosion, quality control is difficult, and the form plate cannot be reused. In this study, a tensile test was carried out on a GFRP plate by using a new method to apply the steel form to the GFRP plate. Effective GFRP slip-form shape and the application method were proposed by conducting finite element analysis and parametric analysis based on the results of the GFRP plate tensile test; performance was verified through a structural test. From the test results, the GFRP slip-form showed better structural performance than the steel form, and the GFRP slip-form construction method may reduce costs because of its reusability, easy quality control, and reduced construction duration. © 2016, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","construction methods; finite element analysis; GFRP plate; parametric analysis; slip-form construction","Fiber reinforced plastics; Plates (structural components); Quality control; Reusability; Slip forming; Tensile testing; Construction duration; Construction method; Continuous forming; Glass fiber reinforced polymer; Mechanical advantage; Parametric -analysis; Slipform construction; Structural performance; Finite element method",Article,Scopus

Waste-water treatment and water reuse is an essential part of environmental sustainability. Herein, we present reusable Fe/Pt multi-functional active microcleaners that are capable of degrading organic pollutants (malachite green and 4-nitrophenol) by generated hydroxyl radicals via a Fenton-like reaction. Various different properties of microcleaners, such as the effect of their size, short-term storage, long-term storage, reusability, continuous swimming capability, surface composition, and mechanical properties, are studied. It is found that these microcleaners can continuously swim for more than 24 hours and can be stored more than 5 weeks during multiple cleaning cycles. The produced microcleaners can also be reused, which reduces the cost of the process. During the reuse cycles the outer iron surface of the Fe/Pt microcleaners generates the in-situ, heterogeneous Fenton catalyst and releases a low concentration of iron into the treated water, while the mechanical properties also appear to be improved due to both its surface composition and structural changes.

In the context of mechanical CAD systems, the nature of the feature-based parametric modeling paradigm, which is based on parent-child interdependencies between features, allows a wide selection of approaches for creating a specific model. Despite the virtually unlimited range of possible strategies for modeling a part, only a small number of them can guarantee an appropriate internal structure which results in a truly reusable CAD model. In this paper, we present an analysis of formal CAD modeling strategies and best practices for history-based parametric design: Delphi's horizontal modeling, explicit reference modeling, and resilient modeling. Aspects considered in our study include the rationale to avoid the creation of unnecessary feature interdependencies, the sequence and selection criteria for those features, and the effects of parent/child relations on model alteration. We provide a comparative evaluation of these strategies in the form of a series of experiments using three industrial CAD models with different levels of complexity. We analyze the internal structure of the models and compare their robustness and flexibility when the geometry is modified. The results reveal significant advantages of formal modeling methodologies, particularly resilient techniques, over non-structured approaches as well as the unexpected problems of the horizontal strategy in numerous modeling situations. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, copper (Cu) exchanged zeolite Y (CuY) was functionalised with triethylenediamine (TEDA) and the capacity to remove Cl2 was evaluated. The materials were characterised by nitrogen (N2) adsorption-desorption studies, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The materials' ability to remove Cl2 was investigated via a dynamic breakthrough test. Copper exchanged zeolite displayed a low adsorption of Cl2 in spite of its large surface area. However, Cl2 removal greatly improved following functionalisation with TEDA. XPS analysis revealed that Cl2 was removed via a catalytic hydrolysis reaction where adsorbed water vapour transformed Cl2 into Cl- which could be further trapped in the zeolite structural framework. Moisture could increase the Cl2 removal capacity, but the competition for adsorption between water and chlorine molecules was also observed. The spent adsorbent after exposure to Cl2 could be easily recycled with an excessive water vapour treatment. The reusability was also investigated and the adsorbent could be used for more than five times. This material can potentially be used in air filters.

The BPA-imprinted (MIP) and non-imprinted (NIP) microbeads were synthesized, and characterized by Zeta-sizer, FTIR, SEM and BET method. Bisphenol A was determined in solutions using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS). The effect of initial concentration of BPA, the adsorption rate and the pH of the medium on the capacity of BPA-imprinting polymer were studied. Adsorption capacity of BPA was affected by the amount of the incorporated functional monomer in the polymer network. BPA adsorption capacity of MIP-3 and NIP microbeads from aqueous medium was estimated as 76.7 and 59.9 mg g-1, respectively. The binding efficiencies of BPA-MIP-3 microbeads for different phenolic compounds (i.e., BPA with p-toluidine, 4-aminophenol or 2-naphthol) were explored at binary solutions, and the binding capacities of BPA-imprinted microbeads were found to be 2.79 × 10-1, 2.39 × 10-1, 7.59 × 10-2 and 5.48 × 10-2 mmol g-1 microbeads, respectively. The satisfactory results demonstrated that the obtained BPA-MIP microbeads showed an appreciable binding specificity toward BPA than similar structural compounds in the aqueous medium. Moreover, the reusability of BPA-MIP-3 microbeads was tested for several times and no significant loss in adsorption capacity was observed.

However, within current paradigms of lowering carbon emissions and enhancing the possibly of material recycling, such traditional composite beams cannot be deconstructed easily and their elements are not recyclable because they rely on welded headed stud connectors that are encased within cast in situ concrete to achieve the necessary shear connection. This paper presents the detailed results of quasi-static tests conducted on full-scale composite beams as part of a novel deconstructable and sustainable structural system. For this system, precast concrete slabs are attached to a steel beam using tensioned high-strength friction-grip bolts in clearance holes as the elements to provide the shear connection. The precast slabs are made using geopolymer concrete in lieu of concrete made from ordinary Portland cement, whose manufacture is a major contributor to anthropogenic CO2 emissions worldwide, thereby enhancing the low-carbon attributes of the structural system. The test results demonstrate the very significant ductility of the beams, with substantial interface slips being developed and sustained at loads close to the ultimate strength limit state. The tension induced in the bolts provides sufficient frictional resistance between the precast slabs and steel beams to ensure that the composite system has full shear interaction throughout the range of service loading. It is also confirmed that composite beams with bolted shear connectors can be deconstructed easily at the end of their service life, with the slabs, steel beams and bolts being reusable in other structural applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Bolted shear connectors; Composite beam; Deconstructability; Geopolymer concrete slabs; Sustainability","Beams and girders; Bolts; Carbon dioxide; Composite beams and girders; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Concretes; Friction; Geopolymers; High strength steel; Inorganic polymers; Interface states; Portland cement; Reinforced concrete; Shear flow; Steel beams and girders; Studs (fasteners); Sustainable development; Composite beam; Deconstructability; Geopolymer concrete; Ordinary Portland cement; Reinforced concrete beams; Shear connector; Steel concrete composite beam; Structural characteristics; Precast concrete; composite; concrete structure; experimental study; polymer; structural component; sustainability",Article,Scopus

Refining of AMPS produces refined residue, which belongs to hazardous waste and must be properly treated and disposed. In this work, the refined residue was reused as the raw material to synthesize scale inhibition copolymer with the addition of AA. The chemical construction and thermal properties of copolymers were confirmed by NMR, FTIR, and thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). To achieve a comprehensive and systematic understanding of copolymers, the inhibition behavior of CaCO3, Ca3(PO4)2, and CaSO4were examined through static scale inhibition tests. The capability of ferric oxide dispersion was also determined. The results of structural analysis were consistent with the expected structures. Static experiments were observed that scale inhibition of Ca3(PO4)2and CaSO4was excellent and the scale inhibition rate was close to 100% when the concentration of AA-AMPS was 30 mg L−1. It was noticed that the performance of copolymers synthesized with AMPS residue appeared nearly no different than when AA-AMPS was synthesized with normal materials. The results show that the refined AMPS residue could be reused as raw material to prepare scale inhibitor copolymer. Significance: Refined residue of AMPS was used to synthesize scale inhibition copolymer in this work. It would bring serious damage to society and environment if the hazardous waste refined residue cannot be properly treated and disposed.

Catalytic glycerol hydrogenolysis to produce 1,3-propanediol is one of the pioneering biosustainable pathways. Bimetallic Pt-Cu catalysts supported on H-mordenite were synthesized with various copper loadings and applied in the selective glycerol hyrogenolysis to 1,3-propanediol in a continuous fixed bed reactor performed in vapor phase under atmospheric pressure. Several techniques such as XRD, ICP-AES, NH3-TPD, Pyr FTIR, BET, TPR, HR-TEM, XPS, and solid state NMR were employed to characterize the physical and chemical properties of Pt-Cu/Mor catalysts. A detailed reaction parametric study has been carried out. The results designated that well dispersed Pt-Cu catalysts with small particle size, supported on a Brønsted acidic H-mordenite with a multiple pore system and strong bimetallic phase-support interaction, promote the selectivity to 1,3-propanediol. Over the Pt-Cu/Mor catalyst of optimum composition (2% Pt and 5% Cu by weight) and under the optimum reaction conditions (210 °C, H2 flow rate of 80 mL min-1, and gly concentration of 10 wt %), the glycerol conversion and 1,3-PD selectivity reached 90% and 58.5%, respectively.

The model is a generalization of classical Johnson-Cook (JC) and provides a much improved coherence for the plastic material description. Specifically, the new model tackles the issue that the effects of equivalent plastic strain rate and temperature shall not be taken as equal for each equivalent plastic strain, avoiding then heavy modeling errors on the lower yield stress and on the subsequent plastic flow. The salient features of the original JC model are shortly reviewed first, paying specific attention to possible modeling incoherencies. Two main shortcoming issues are framed and discussed. Further, a review on several modifications of the JC model from the literature is outlined. Then, the new SJC model is introduced in such a framework and thoroughly described. A comprehensive discussion on its calibration strategies follows, by developing three alternative calibration approaches. The new model is then applied to the material description of three real material cases (a structural steel, a commercially pure metal and a stainless steel), by considering literature sets of hardening functions recorded at different equivalent plastic strain rates and temperatures. SJC predicted trends are checked against experimental data, for each calibration strategy, by evaluating the material prediction on both lower yield stress and plastic flow. Obtained results are also compared to those provided by plain JC. The SJC model shows the capability to remarkably improve the material description, as compared to plain JC. Moreover, the fact of presenting a form very similar to that of the original JC model allows to possibly reusing some of the JC material parameters, which may be already known from available calibrations. Also, the SJC model keeps the same computational appeal of the original JC model and need of experimental data toward calibration, while heaviness of calibration and computational weight remain almost unchanged. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The resultant graphene/δ-MnO2 architectures showed an interconnected 3D network microstructure, in which a large number of ultrathin birnessite MnO2 nanosheets were homogenously deposited on the graphene framework. Due to their unique structural characteristics, the resulting 3D aerogels exhibited a fast adsorption kinetic rate and superior adsorption capacity toward heavy metal ions. The saturated adsorption capacities of graphene/δ-MnO2 aerogels were as large as 643.62 mg g-1 for Pb2+, 250.31 mg g-1 for Cd2+ and 228.46 mg g-1 for Cu2+ calculated by the Langmuir isotherm model, exceeding largely the corresponding pristine 3D graphene and δ-MnO2 nanosheets. It was noted that the heavy metal ions could not only adsorb on the surface of graphene/δ-MnO2, but also intercalate into the interlayer gaps of birnessite MnO2, which reveals the synergistic effect of the static electrical attraction, surface complexation and ion exchange between heavy metal ions and pre-intercalated K+, supported by the expansion of the basic crystal structure of layered MnO2 after adsorption. Furthermore, it is interesting that the regenerated aerogels after the initial HCl and subsequent KOH treatment still maintain their original shape and can be repeatedly used for more than eight cycles without obvious degradation of performance, which achieved the sustainability of the absorbents. More importantly, the hybrid aerogels can be easily separated and do not generate secondary contaminants. High removal efficiency, fast adsorption kinetics, excellent regeneration and reusability, and ease of separation operation make these hybrid aerogels ideal candidates for heavy metal ion decontamination in practical application. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.",,"Adsorption; Aerogels; Composite films; Crystal structure; Graphene; Heavy metals; Integrated circuit interconnects; Ion exchange; Isotherms; Metal ions; Metals; Nanosheets; Reusability; Self assembly; Adsorption capacities; Langmuir isotherm models; Regeneration and reusability; Removal efficiencies; Removal of heavy metal ions; Saturated adsorption capacity; Structural characteristics; Threedimensional (3-d); Manganese oxide",Article,Scopus

The textural parameters of the nanocomposite are adjustable by controlling the preparation conditions. The unique structure of the prepared nanocomposite showed relatively high methylene blue adsorption capability and can be used for removal of dye from aqueous solution.

Thermal structural challenges can be quite severe on re-entry vehicles and CMC provide high strength at elevated temperatures which are key features for hot structures. One of the primary thermal structural challenges results from large thermal gradients. Control surfaces such as flaps are often hot and are often connected to an actuator inside the vehicle which is much cooler.

Continuous strain data was collected during the entire erecting process of the new building using a wireless sensor network to obtain novel information on construction-induced stresses. The collected data will be used to assess the magnitude of construction induced stresses.

A sample of 51 UPRFS in Portugal was selected, and visual and mechanical properties were evaluated through non-destructive and destructive tests. Dynamic modulus of elasticity (MOEdyn) was correlated with bending strength (MOR) (r = 0.43) and modulus of elasticity (MOE) (r = 0.71). UPRFS showed a decrease of 14% and 6% in the mean values of MOR and MOE, respectively, when compared with new utility poles. A high variability and low values were obtained for MOR. These results highlight the reuse potential of the maritime pine utility poles for structural applications.

An asymmetric self-anchored cable-stayed bridge is proposed. The structural segments constructed by heavyweight materials (e.g., steel and concrete) are used as counter-weights at the rescue end and the cross-river segments are constructed by lightweight materials (e.g., composite materials) in order to increase the span to easily reach the isolated island end without any supports or foundations. The lightweight temporary composite bridge system includes a weight balance structural module, a bridge tower structural module, a crossing structural module, and connection cables. By combining the great strength and light weight of glass fiber reinforced composite material with the structural features of an asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge, this technology overcomes the time restrictions imposed in the past by the use of temporary roadways made from concrete pipes (which often take from 3 days to a week for construction) and temporary steel bridges (require approximately 1-3 weeks for installation).

This work aims to study the technical feasibility of raw clay waste addition in clayey mass used in the structural ceramic production. Samples of raw clay waste and clay were tested for chemical, physical and mineralogical characterization. Specimens containing waste contents, varying from 10% to 90% (wt.), were produced and burned in an industrial tunnel at 850°C. The technological properties evaluated were: water absorption, apparent porosity, apparent density, loss on ignition, firing shrinkage and mechanical strength. The results show that the addition of waste improves the evaluated properties significantly. With this, the reuse of raw clay waste in the clayey mass for production of ceramic roof tiles and blocks can contribute to the sustainability of ceramics sectors, reducing raw materials consumption and avoiding waste disposal in landfills.

Main characteristics of this project are the flexibility (payload adaptation) and partial reusability of the first stage. Currently, even with precise physical models, nothing can replace a flight test. That is why Matriochka is a real prototype (cheaper than industrial ones) to test reusability after an atmospheric flight. First, Matriochka project seeks to offer transport to a wide range of payloads. Consequently, a high flexibility criterion guided the whole design process. Since the payloads of interest mainly vary in their diameter and mass, integration and aerodynamic stability required a particular attention. To deal with this, for example, some foam was employed to ensure a steady contact between the payload and the inner surface of the launcher fairing. Once carved, foam suits perfectly the shape of the payload. What is more, the change of mass and thus the evolution of aerodynamic stability specifications were countered by using sliding fins along the fuselage. Just before launch, the center of gravity of the system will be measured in order to fix the fins to the ideal position. The design was focused on reusability which involves high expectations on robustness, quality and recovery function. The cost per launch will decrease flights after flights in order to pay off the preliminary investments, but it also contains maintenance costs; that is why number of consumable parts is limited. Maintenance time is also restricted to 3 weeks which is short compared to the 2 years required to realize the launcher. Reusability challenge is also testing carbon structure after ground impact because composite reusability is still in development. How to evaluate number of cycles the structure can undergo, when damages are often invisible? Testing methods such as X-ray can be used, but real tests using prototypes are still necessary. Finally Matriochka is a small launcher which has to prove that a partial reusability is possible to decrease the global launch costs and also to open potential market with a large capability of payloads. However if private companies have already a potential reusable launcher, a question is still in progress: even if it would be possible to recover a launcher sub-system, how can we prove its reliability for a second flight? For Matriochka, the recovery result will be available next July therefore requalification tests will be developed. Copyright © 2016 BY THE INTERNATIONAL ASTRONAUTICAL FEDERATION (IAF).

In the context of general reduction of resources, it is necessary to save the used energy and to keep the resources in the material cycle. The fact of high material and energy consumption in the building sector requires development of new methods of construction that provide a sustainable use of natural resources. Besides the need to reduce CO2 emission, the reduction of the use of primary mineral products requires a major course of action in Europe. This paper focuses on the development of a fully recyclable modular system in massive construction for housing. The objectives are to reach a high grade of non-destructively demountable construction components. In comparison to common masonry walls, the new method enables the units to become fully reused in new walls. This construction principle can be transferred to mounted slabs. In this case masonry units are mounted with unbounded pre-stressing, which will realise demountable slabs. The contribution bases on the project REMOMAB that examined different principles for fully recyclable massive modular designs. It includes details such as a demountable wall-slab-junction.

The appraisal is carried out by means of life cycle assessment (LCA) and covers different timber constructions, mainly the multi-storey building. The ultimate goal is to compare their environmental performance to the outcomes of other constructions like reinforced concrete (RC) and steel construction (SC). The environmental burdens caused by constructions are evaluated based on the framework of LCA. First, the material inventory of selected building projects is established. The scope is emphasised on the primary structural elements such as columns, beams, deck, load-bearing wall and roof. Secondary components, facility and decoration are eliminated out of the research boundary. Based on the material inventory, the impact assessment is carried out to preliminarily calculate the embodied outcome of the timber constructions. The environmental implications of structural elements during early life cycle stages are evaluated. Then, the effect of both disposal and material recycling is integrated in the LCA, including reuse or recovery of the structural wooden components. The LCA takes into account different disposal scenarios associated with construction and demolition waste (C&DW). By doing so, the LCA is the so-called 'from cradle to gate' and 'gate to cradle', without consideration upon the using phase. Among numerous environmental indictors, this research quantifies and discusses the energy consumption and global warming potential (GWP) of the timber buildings only. The five-storey timber building located in urban context is a pioneer project in Taiwan. This building applies crosslaminated-timber (CLT) as the primary structural elements and takes over tremendous loading circumstances. It demonstrates not only the engineering feasibility of CLT for architectural design but also the utilising compatibility of wooden house in urban context. The environmental evaluation proofs the ecological efficiency of timber buildings. In addition, this study compares the environmental performance of timber constructions and other materials. Alternative building models made of RC and steel are developed and intended for further LCA. The LCA results demonstrate that timber constructions cause significantly less impacts than RC and SC do. Timber constructions exhibit carbon sequestration effect, which is unique among three materials. Meanwhile, timber constructions consume only about 20% energy of the RC and SC.

Design problems form an essential component of experiments in creativity research. However, the formulation of a design problem for an experiment is still a challenging task. An opportunity for the design community is leverage existing design problems to reduce a source of difference between experiments and increase the validity of new method and tools. To answer this question, fifty-five design problems, published over the past fifteen years, were collected and analyzed using two approaches. First, the information content of the design problems was assessed based on five structural elements. A protocol study was developed with four independent evaluators, who were asked to identify the five elements in a set of design problems. A high correlation was observed for the characteristics: goal of a problem, functional requirements, non-functional requirement and reference to an existing product. A low correlation was observed for the characteristics information about end user. The results suggest that this approach could serve as a useful tool in comparing and selecting problems with a desired number of elements. In the second approach, latent semantic analysis was used to compare the design problems. Latent semantic analysis enables design problem similarity to be computed prior to solving the problem. However, this method cannot identify the nuances in problem representations, which could potentially affect solution development. The paper concludes with an appeal to research community of using similar or benchmarked design problems, and postulate other means to enable comparison or development of problems in creativity research.

Incorporation of raw clay waste is an alternative to make the structural ceramic sector more environmentally sustainable while reducing the consumption of clayey raw material. The Brazilian structural ceramic industry consumes 10.3 million tons of clay per month. This work aims to study the technical feasibility of raw clay waste addition in clayey mass used in the structural ceramic production. Samples of raw clay waste and clay were tested for chemical, physical and mineralogical characterization. Specimens containing waste contents, varying from 10% to 90% (wt), were produced and burned in an industrial tunnel at 850°C. The technological properties evaluated were: water absorption, apparent porosity, apparent density, loss on ignition, firing shrinkage and mechanical strength. The results show that the addition of waste improves the evaluated properties significantly. With this, the reuse of raw clay waste in the clayey mass for production of ceramic roof tiles and blocks can contribute to the sustainability of ceramics sectors, reducing raw materials consumption and avoiding waste disposal in landfills. It becomes a feasible alternative to aim the ceramic industry comes to be a ""green structural ceramic"".","Green structural ceramic; Raw clay waste; Sustainability; Waste","Building materials; Ceramic products; Clay products; Sustainable development; Wastes; Water absorption; Apparent porosity; Ceramic industries; Ceramic roof tiles; Disposal in landfills; Feasible alternatives; Mineralogical characterization; Raw clay; Technological properties; Waste disposal",Conference Paper,Scopus

An ongoing adaptive reuse project of the building aims to recover its full capacity and also its importance to the fortified village of Almeida, by implementing a variety of new uses. While adaptive reuse projects of historical buildings are a very recommendable solution for maintaining those constructions whose use has become obsolete, these projects demand careful study because they may introduce changes in the structural behaviour of the buildings to preserve. The architectural intervention results in the need of the structure to withstand new and diverse imposed loads, as well as inserting passages and communication systems to enable a proper contemporary use of the building, fulfilling architectural requirements and current building codes. As the current configuration of the structure will be altered, the main objective of this paper is to evaluate the suitability of some of the proposed structural interventions. Such evaluation requires a good understanding of the current state of the structure and the alterations proposed by the project. The current condition has been characterized following a multidisciplinary approach comprising historical research, visual inspection, non-destructive testing and structural analysis. The alterations proposed by the project have been described, identifying possible sources of major structural problems. A portion of the building particularly affected by the alterations has been selected to carry out structural analysis. A comparative safety assessment of the selected area in both current and altered condition has been done through finite element modelling and nonlinear static analysis, resulting in an identification of the weaker points against the new implemented loads and alterations. Finally, proposals for the implementation of the studied intervention, as well as recommendations for future research and analyses, have been given. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Building codes; Buildings; Finite element method; Historic preservation; Nondestructive examination; Static analysis; Current configuration; Finite element modelling; Historical buildings; Multi-disciplinary approach; Non destructive testing; Non-linear static analysis; Research and analysis; Structural interventions; Structural analysis",Conference Paper,Scopus

Although insufficient attention is sometimes given to these actions, it is essential to spread information regarding new studies in the field of waste recycling, which encourages and promotes waste use. Reusing and recycling construction waste in the creation of buildings and infrastructure are fundamental strategies to achieving sustainability in the construction and engineering sectors. In this context, the concept of waste would no longer exist, as waste would become a material resource. Therefore, this study analyses the behaviours of two unbound mixed recycled aggregates (MRA) in the structural layers of an unpaved rural road with low traffic (category T43). The sections were built on inappropriate soil (A-7-6) with a high degree of free swelling. The experimental road consisted of three sections: the first was made with natural aggregates (NA) that were used as a control, the second was composed of MRA in the subbase and NA in the base, and the third section was completely composed of MRA. The materials were characterised in the laboratory. The behaviours of the structural layers in the experimental road were determined by controlling compaction (""in situ"" density and moisture) and measuring the deflections and load capacity (deflectometer) during the 18 months after construction. The results show that the sections made with recycled aggregates meet the technical specifications required by General Technical Specifications for Road and Bridge Works (PG-3). Therefore, the water-soluble sulphate content and Los Angeles abrasion coefficient limits can be increased for recycled aggregates without compromising the quality of this type of road with low traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study regarding the use of unbound MRA made from construction and demolition waste (CDW) in the construction of an unpaved rural road with low traffic on an expansive clay subgrade. © 2016 by the authors.","Construction and demolition waste; Construction materials; Expansive clays; Mixed recycled aggregates; Unpaved rural roads","Aggregates; Building materials; Charge density waves; Construction industry; Demolition; Rural areas; Rural roads; Specifications; Sulfur compounds; Sustainable development; Swelling; Construction activities; Construction and demolition waste; Construction wastes; Expansive clays; Los Angeles abrasion; Mixed recycled aggregates; Recycled aggregates; Technical specifications; Recycling",Article,Scopus

To answer this question, two main variables are determinant: the physical and functional qualities and the behaviour of the key-actors. These variables are examined in this case study of the Ringers building. Ringers - as it is locally called - was a once famous chocolate manufacturer based in the Dutch town Alkmaar. The Ringers factory building dates from the interbellum and was specially designed for the manufacture of chocolate. Situated opposite the historic city as the first building on the north shore of the Noord Hollands canal and designed in a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired Amsterdam school architecture, it has been part of the mind-set of local peoples for ages. After the closure of the chocolate factory it was converted to a shopping centre, and after bankruptcy faced demolition and replacement by a new shopping mall. The relevancy of the Ringers case lies in the multifaceted importance of the building, its ability to accommodate different functions and the availability of relevant data. Following the above motioned two main variables, the objectives of the paper are the reuse potencies of the building with special focus on both its architectural and structural characteristic on the one side and its building history and behaviour of the key-actors on the other side.

The prime focus telescope will be equipped with dedicated instrumentation to take advantage of one of the best sites in the northern hemisphere and offer its users the ability to perform large surveys. Central themes of the development plan are reusing and upgrading wherever possible. MSE will reuse the CFHT site and build upon the existing observatory infrastructure, using the same building and telescope pier as CFHT, while minimizing environmental impact on the summit. MSE will require structural support upgrades to the building to meet the latest building seismic code requirements and accommodate a new larger telescope and upgraded enclosure. It will be necessary to replace the current dome since a larger slit opening is needed for a larger telescope. MSE will use a thermal management system to remove heat generated by loads from the building, flush excess heat from lower levels, and maintain the observing environment temperature.

It is important to reuse these materials and dispose of them.

The paper presents my own research using substrates resulting from the processing of waste: foam glass and high-impact polystyrene and the possibility of their use as modifiers composition of basic construction materials. Glass foam is made from glass cullet. It has many advantages, positive effect on the adsorption of sound and workability. Due to the spherical shape and low density it is used as an ultra-light filler. The second addition is High Impact Polystyrene (High Impact Polystyrene - HIPS for short) which is a butadiene rubber modified polystyrene. With the change amount of the rubber mechanical and physical properties of the material are also changed, for example, by increasing the toughness of HIPS.

If the former were removed, the latter would lose something of its essence, especially when the building has been designed as a total artwork: a gesamtkunstwerk. Often used to describe any integration of different forms of artistic work, this term allows another reading which limits its application to the context of its Wagnerian origins, to the achievements of art nouveau. According to this reading, Gesamtkunstwerk and Le Corbusier's synthesis of arts are quite distinct notions. Is there a real distinction between the two concepts? If so, what are the consequences for conservation? Our discussion of these issues is based on the opposition between Le Corbusier's concept of tapestry as muralnomad and the sedentary walls of total art. We will compare the vertical surfaces of the interiors of modern buildings, (carpets, stained-glass windows, furniture) from a tectonic perspective, focusing on the relationship between these elements and the environmental space they inhabit. We examine some of Marianne Peretti's artworks, such as stained glass/panelling made for the CFA (Delepine Impasse, Paris), Jaburu Chapel and Brasilia Cathedral. These involve a variety of tectonic relationships, either nomadic or sedentary, that appear to be independent from both the original building design concept and the materiality of the object. Rather than operating as the essence of the building, the way these panels interact with the space they enter challenges the traditional assessment of the subordination of the work of art to architecture as the greatest art form. Migration would therefore be acceptable when nomadic walls are relatively autonomous or transcend the place in which they are situated. © Pola Virgioli, 2016.",,"Architectural design; Buildings; Interiors (building); Tectonics; Walls (structural partitions); Artistic works; Building design; Environmental space; Interior designs; ITS applications; Modern buildings; Traditional assessment; Vertical surface; Stained glass",Conference Paper,Scopus

""Corrugation and Galvanization of Sheet Iron"" was patented in 28.4.1829 by Henry Robinson Palmer who built bow-shape open-shelters for tondon Dock Company. Galvanizing method proved to be extremely important for the life-span of corrugated iron. French civil engineer Stanislaw Sorel improved hot-dip zinc-coating method and got a patent in 1837. However, significant modern architecture has been built of corrugated iron in 20th century such as Frey House 1 in Palm Springs by Albert Frey 1953. There is also a story of Christal Palace 1851: glass and steel frame construction was selected because it was cheaper than corrugated iron! Corrugations made sheets rigid and gave additional structural strength. Early machine ""corrugated iron manual roller"" from 19th century is on display in Kapunda museum in south-Australia. Most famous model for corrugated iron has been sine wave. However, many other profiles (and other metals copper, alumina and COR-TEN steel) have been developed especially after 1960s: 2 examples of architect Erkki Kairamo: Marimekko textile factory, Helsinki 1974 and A. Ahlström paper factory in Varkaus 1975-77. Corrugated iron was a cheap, self-supporting and light material. In 1855 for example Davis Rowell sold ""portable buildings"" for dwellings, churches, chapels, hotels, schools and hospitals. These early prefabricated facade-systems were shipped from Europe to Africa, Canada and South-America: in 1854 nearly 30000 ""corrugated iron kit buildings"" only to Australia. During the WWI Peter Norman Nissen patented a barrack for British army. Built in 100 000 copies Nissen Bow Hut became a global icon for corrugated iron. Nevertheless, it's characteristics made it also neglected. Until WWII corrugated iron buildings reflected mostly destitution and indulgence. It was derelict material for agricultural and temporary buildings, cow sheds and cold storage. On the other hand, corrugated iron is vulnerable and prompt to weathering and mechanical damage, but durable and long-lasting if protected and maintained. In my article I will present most common (electrochemical) corrosion types and coating failures as well as the environmental factors causing corrosion. To reuse corrugated iron buildings, it is important to identify their architectural, historical and cultural values. Restoration and conservation measures should follow the idea of minimum intervention. I will discuss methods for corrosion prevention and protection by literature, personal observations as well as drawings, designs and specifications for implemented renovations. © Pola Virgioli, 2016.",,"Agricultural machinery; Alumina; Architecture; Buildings; Coatings; Cold storage; Corrosion; Corrosion prevention; Galvanizing; Textile industry; Zinc coatings; Conservation measures; Environmental factors; Hot dip zinc coating; Mechanical damages; Minimum interventions; Modern architectures; Steel frame construction; Structural strength; Iron",Conference Paper,Scopus

In order to assume these challenges, products lines approach looks for the reuse of common characteristics of products and the harnessing of the variability of other characteristics useful to satisfy exigencies of customers. The features model, widely used in the development of products lines, has limitations to treat the complexity of domains, to adopt standard guides to construction and segmentation of domain models. In our research, domain knowledge is organized in different ways, in order to represent tangible and intangible realities using mathematical, conceptual, and physical models. Traditional engineering, as mechanical, civil, materials, and hydraulic has important applications in automotive, and aerospace industry, and in the construction of ships, buildings, railways, roads, among others. There, it is easy to appreciate the common use of ideal, conceptual, and physical models in projects development. In civil engineering, for example, new structural elements, their conceptual representations, mathematical models, software systems for analysis and design, and physical models use concepts of a domain model, which depict common and variable characteristics of a products line. In this work, we model domain in terms of goals and characteristics, highlighting the reusable part of products and the variability.

To accomplish the changeability of a manufacturing system one important enabler is modularity, which facilitates reusability.

To facilitate the difficult task of selecting a proper rehabilitation strategy - often restricted by international treaties for non-invasiveness and reversibility of the intervention - and given the practical requirements for the buildings' intended reuse, this paper presents a practical procedure for assessment of seismic demands of URM buildings - mainly historical constructions that lack a well-defined diaphragm action. A key ingredient of the method is approximation of the spatial shape of lateral translation, Φ, that the building assumes when subjected to a uniform field of lateral acceleration. Using Φ as a 3-D shape function, the dynamic response of the system is evaluated, using the concepts of SDOF approximation of continuous systems. This enables determination of the envelope of the developed deformations and the tendency for deformation and damage localization throughout the examined building for a given design earthquake scenario. Deformation demands are specified in terms of relative drift ratios referring to the in-plane and the out-of-plane seismic response of the building's structural elements. Drift ratio demands are compared with drift capacities associated with predefined performance limits. The accuracy of the introduced procedure is evaluated through (a) comparison of the response profiles with those obtained from detailed time-history dynamic analysis using a suite of ten strong ground motion records, five of which with near-field characteristics, and (b) evaluation of the performance assessment results with observations reported in reconnaissance reports of the field performance of two neoclassical torsionally-sensitive historical buildings, located in Thessaloniki, Greece, which survived a major earthquake in the past. © 2016 Techno-Press, Ltd.","Historical and monumental buildings; Pushover analysis; Seismic assessment; Torsion; Unreinforced masonry structures (URM)","Buildings; Damage detection; Deformation; Earthquake effects; Geophysics; Masonry materials; Seismic response; Seismology; Torsional stress; Deformation and damages; Monumental buildings; Near-field characteristics; Push-over analysis; Rehabilitation strategy; Seismic assessment; Time-history dynamic analysis; Unreinforced masonry structures; Earthquakes",Article,Scopus

Once nature does not provide the required climate conditions for that to happen, humans can take action. Based on that concept, a consortium of three Dutch companies (Zwarts &amp; Jansma Architects, Royal HaskoningDHV, and Polyned) presents a sharp, cool and innovative idea that can facilitate sport's industry in desert-covered areas; the Shaded Dome™. The Shaded Dome™ is a semi-permanent facility, comprised of an air-supported dome excluding any internal supports. A very light and highly resistant outer fabric tent (the Shade) covers it, transforming it into an astonishing state-of-the-art building. A grid of cavity struts links the two layers, creating a peripheral structural system that supports the whole structure. A pleasant internal microclimate is enabled by a constant natural airflow between the dome and the shade together with the use of a custom made combination of several membrane materials. This passive design element provides protection from extreme climatological conditions like solar radiation, wind, high air temperature, humidity and precipitation. The first real-scale models are already under development and the results are extremely encouraging. The current tests show an almost 20oC temperature decline between the dome's skins, reducing consequently the need for high demanding cooling systems. Next to that the Shaded Dome™ requires limited transport volume, and can be constructed and dismantled in a matter of days. Thus, the preponderant fabrication plan promotes the sources' economy, the efficient materials' use, the reusability of the product and the self-support of its energy needs, highlighting that way a new concept on the asset management of future sport infrastructure. Moving into an era where the need for dynamic constructions is becoming more and more intense, the Shaded Dome™ can constitute an easy to build, quick and fit-for-purpose solution which can efficiently meet any sport infrastructure requirements. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Demand for environmental responsibility also reached the building material and construction sector. Green building has become more widespread over the past decade and can be considered a challenge for specifiers and building products manufacturers. Ecodesign, an application of the sustainable development concept, is one of the available tools to address this challenge. This article aims at proposing an ecodesign pathway for appearance wood products in the nonresidential building sector. Through extrapolating results from a previous interior wood door case study, it has been possible to obtain environmental profiles for the main segments of the appearance wood products family for nonresidential buildings. These profiles have allowed devising ecodesign solutions. Results show that for this whole family of products, raw materials are what cause the most environmental impacts, followed by shipping and end-of-life stages. Product component weight tends also to influence the environmental profile. Ecodesign solutions for composite-based products are strongly related to decreasing the composite component weight by design and remanufacturing. For solid wood-based products, ecodesign can be approached through remanufacturing or reclaiming, using locally certified sustainable wood. The use of hardwood waste may be available for energy purposes, but this may not be as relevant as reuse and recycle in the context of the province of Quebec energy grid mix. © Forest Products Society 2016.",,"Buildings; Construction industry; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Hardwoods; Sustainable development; Wood; Wood products; Building products; Composite components; Construction sectors; Environmental awareness; Environmental profile; Environmental responsibility; Environmentally friendly products; Nonresidential buildings; Product design; Buildings; Structural Design; Sustainable Forest Management; Wood Products",Review,Scopus

However, there are also numerous problems in analyzing these kinds of profiles using solid finite elements, such as modeling, meshing, solution time problems, etc. Therefore, beam finite elements have been used in the present study in modeling of the profiles.

At median-Pf = 0.50 auc was increased 98% from 11.4 to 22.5 kJm-2 at low temperature of 77 K, while the HLEBI increased auc at Pf = 0.50 221% and 25% at 200 and 300 K, respectively. Although the lowest statistical impact value calculated by the 3-parameter Weibull equation, as at Pf = 0 (as) was reduced in the 200K samples, as was improved for the 77 and 300K samples. The lower as for the 200K samples is probably the result of high scatter in the data although the auc was remarkably improved at all experimental Pf. In general, the auc increased with test temperature. Optical observation shows the HLEBI appears to increase the auc by preventing brittle shattering of the ABS core in the 77 and 200K samples, and increasing core ductility in the 300K samples. Within the outer single CFRP plies the HLEBI strengthens by generating dangling bonds in the epoxy matrix as micro-compressive forces increasing adhesion to the fibers by terminated atoms by Coulomb attractive force. Since calculated HLEBI penetration depth, Dth into the sample was less (119 μm) than the 265μm CFRP ply thickness, it is possible the strengthened plies carried the load protecting the ABS core. It is also possible the highly conductive carbon fibers transferred charge to the ABS core, generating dangling bonds and/or polarizing the ABS polymer strengthening the ABS itself preventing shattering. © 2016 The Japan Institute of Metals and Materials.","Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS); Carbon fiber; Electron beam; Epoxy; Impact test; Low temperature; Sandwich structures","ABS resins; Carbon fibers; Crashworthiness; Dangling bonds; Electron beams; Electrons; Fibers; Impact testing; Irradiation; Rapid thermal annealing; Reusability; Sandwich structures; Styrene; Temperature; Textile industry; Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene; Conductive carbon fiber; Epoxy; Fracture probability; Low energy electron beam irradiation; Low temperatures; Optical observations; Reusable launch vehicles; Core samples",Article,Scopus

Materials such as Copper slag, Phospogypsum and Fly ash, when used as supplements for sand and coarse aggregate in the manufacture of wall materials, reduce the cost of construction considerably. Additionally, construction of buildings using these materials leads to more energy efficient buildings and can gain additional weightage (points) in Green building certification.

The highest SERS sensitivity that allowed as low as 10 -10 M aqueous CV to be detected, was achieved with the PEG/(C 4 H 9 O) 4 Ti molar ratio being 0.08% and with 30 min of UV irradiation. With this film a linear relationship was established through experiment between SERS intensity and CV concentration from 10 -10 to 10 -5 M, which could be used as a calibration curve for CV concentration measurement. In addition, the film could be reused as a SERS substrate for up to four times without significantly losing SERS sensitivity if a simple regeneration was followed. It is visualized that the Ag/TiO 2 film on glass has potentials for being developed into a practical SERS substrate with high sensitivity and good reusability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The ZnO-MSs with the diameter about 700 nm was initially prepared by ultrasonic technology. Subsequently, Ag-NPs with a diameter of 20-50 nm were anchored onto the surface of the as-prepared ZnO-MSs by a microwave polyol process. The morphology, structural and optical properties of the as-synthesized materials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The results show that the surface plasmon absorption band of Ag/ZnO composites is distinctly broadened and the PL intensity of Ag/ZnO heterostructural composites varies with the increase of Ag loading. The photocatalytic activity of the Ag/ZnO composites were evaluated by the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) solution under ultraviolet (UV) and visible light irradiation. The rate of degradation of the as-prepared Ag/ZnO composites was more than triple times faster than that of pure ZnO-MSs under UV light, which was ascribed to the formation of Schottky barriers in the regions between Ag-NPs and ZnO-MSs. Furthermore, Ag/ZnO composites exhibit superior photocatalytic activity over ZnO-MSs in the visible light region owing to the effective electron transfer from plasmon-excited Ag(0) nanoparticles to ZnO-MSs by strong localization of surface plasmon resonance (SPR). This can effectively decrease the recombination of electron-hole pairs, lead to a prolonged lifetime of the electron-holes pairs that promotes the degradation efficiency. The chemical stability and reusability of Ag/ZnO powders were also investigated. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

According to the structural characteristics (changeable surface-charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties) of the targeted contaminant, CN-MCP was designed owning special structure (pH- and temperature-responsiveness for the changeable surface-charge and adjustable hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties, respectively). Compared to chitosan magnetic composite particles without grafting modification (CS-MCP) and several other reported adsorbents, CN-MCP exhibited relatively high adsorption capacity for nonylphenol under corresponding optimal conditions (123 mg/g at pH 9 and 20 °C; 116 mg/g at pH 5 and 40 °C). Meanwhile, high selectivity of the novel adsorbent in selective adsorption of nonylphenol from bisolute solution of nonylphenol and phenol was found. Effects of grafting ratio of the grafted polymer branches and coexisting inorganic salts on the adsorption were systematically investigated. Moreover, CN-MCP demonstrated desired reusability during 20 times of adsorption-desorption recycling. The high adsorption capacity, high selectivity, and desired reusability aforementioned revealed the significant application potential of CN-MCP in the removal of NP. On the basis of the adsorption behaviors, isotherms equilibrium, thermodynamics and kinetics studies, and instrumental analyses including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, BET specific surface area, zeta potential, and static water contact angle measurements, distinct adsorption mechanisms were found under various conditions: charge attraction between CN-MCP and the contaminant, as well as binding between polymeric branches of CN-MCP and nonyls, contributed to the adsorption at pH 9 and 20 °C; whereas hydrophobic interaction between CN-MCP and nonylphenol played a dominant role at pH 5 and 40 °C.

Geometric characterization is demonstrated in this article to have a key role to play in the decision process for each case of potential steel reuse, because it is necessary for identifying unknown in situ member sizes and assembly geometries, and for quantifying uncertainty when assessing the reliability of a structure. Without automation of this analysis, it is speculated that such a detailed decision making process would not be feasible. The key role of geometric characterization is demonstrated in this article through a series of remote, 3D imaging experiments and reliability analyses. The reliability analysis demonstrated that automated geometric identification using an algorithm developed for the current study results in a 56% reduction in capacity when compared to similar new steel members. Alternatively, more manual methods of remote geometry detection resulted in only a 2% reduction in capacity. It is concluded that semi-automated geometric characterization has the potential to support increased steel reuse through reduced identification costs and improved reliability. A new set of methods and an understanding of their utility in making reuse more attractive through reduced costs and improved reliability is thus contributed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most important factors in improving productivity is design reuse, which current tools have yet to fully exploit. Reusing designs involve manually searching through repositories to find a design that meets the requirements of a project. This search can be tedious and often unfruitful. In order to promote design reuse, an automated discovery technique is proposed: a reference circuit is compared with an archive of existing designs such that similar circuits are suggested throughout the design phase, however, most circuit comparison techniques are focused on exact matches. In this paper, a method of comparing the similarity of circuits using a birthmarking technique is presented. The birthmarking technique captures a wide range of features including structural characteristics, such as components and nets, and functional characteristics, such as dataflow, into a single compact representation. Experiments and evaluations of the birthmarking technique were performed on over 150 circuits from various sources in order to show the feasibility of the proposed methods. Results show that using birthmarks to compare the similarity of circuits is promising. © 2015 IEEE.","Birthmark; Discovery; FPGA; Fuzzy; Hardware; Productivity; Reuse; Similarity","Computer hardware; Design; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Hardware; Productivity; Reconfigurable hardware; Birthmark; Discovery; Fuzzy; Reuse; Similarity; Information use",Conference Paper,Scopus

The Ni based catalyst was found to possess excellent activity (&gt;95%) toward the destruction of 100mg/L nitrosopyrrolidine in 5mol/kg MEA solution at 120psi hydrogen pressure and 120°C temperature in 4h. Catalyst reusability study was conducted for 15 cycles showed high catalyst activity and stability lasting more than 60h. This catalyst was prepared by incipient-wetness technique and was characterized by SEM, TPR, N2 adsorption-desorption and XRD to determine its intrinsic structural properties. The catalyst was further studied with several different nitrosamines to prove its utility toward multiple nitrosamines. © 2015.","CO2 capture; Hydrogenation; Nickel catalyst; Nitrosamines; Solvent recovery approach","Carbon dioxide; Chemical reactors; Hydrogen; Hydrogenation; Nickel; Nitrosamines; Reusability; Catalyst reusability; CO2 capture; Environmental concerns; Hydrogen pressures; Laboratory experiments; Metal-support interactions; Nickel catalyst; Solvent recovery; Catalyst activity; aqueous solution; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; catalyst; nickel; recovery; solvent",Article,Scopus

In the vibration-based fatigue method, a base-excited plate specimen is driven into a high frequency resonant mode until failure. Compared to the axial testing methods, vibration-based failure better represents the conditions and surface-initiated cracks experienced by structural components subject to high frequency vibrations, like blades and vanes in gas turbine engines. In addition, the method produces data over 40 times faster than conventional axial testing methods. Only a small portion of the vibration-based bending specimen is needed to determine crack initiation failure. In order to reduce material waste, a hybrid bending system was designed to test a small specimen held in a reusable carrier plate, thereby reducing material costs to gather HCF data.

The paper examines whether Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology coupled with Building Information Modelling (BIM) may enable components and/or assemblies to be tracked and imported into virtual models for new buildings at the design stage. The addition of stress sensors to components, which provides the capability of quantifying the stress properties of steel over its working life, may also support best practice reuse of resources. The potential to improve resource efficiency in many areas of production and consumption, emerging from a novel combination of such technologies, is highlighted using a theoretical case study scenario. In addition, a case analysis of the demolition/deconstruction of a former industrial building is conducted to illustrate potential savings in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) from reuse when compared with recycling. The paper outlines the reasoning behind the combination of the discussed technologies and alludes to some possible applications and new business models. For example, a company that currently manufactures and 'sells' steel, or a third party, could find new business opportunities by becoming a 'reseller' of reused steel and providing a 'steel service'.

Photoinduced surface-relief-gratings (SRGs) on azo polymer films were used as a master to fabricate the MIP gratings. For the fabrication, SRGs were inscribed by irradiation with interfering Ar+ laser beams and the elastomeric stamps were obtained by replica-molding against the SRG-bearing masters. The MIP gratings were produced by microcontact printing with the stamps and in situ photo-polymerization/crosslinking of a functional monomer (4-vinyl pyridine, 4-VP), template (2,4-D), crosslinker (ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate), and photo-initiator in a mixed methanol/H2O solution. The quantitative detections of 2,4-D were achieved by monitoring the variations of diffraction efficiencies of the gratings, which varied with the 2,4-D concentrations in solutions. The diffraction efficiency (DE) variation was triggered by the binding between 2,4-D molecules and caves formed by 4-VP structural units in the MIP. The saturated diffraction efficiency (DE/DE0) was observed to be linearly correlated with the 2,4-D concentration in the testing range. The methodology developed in this study for 2,4-D detection shows excellent sensitivity with the fast response, high selectivity from the analogous compounds, continuous sensing ability and reusability. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The spacecraft was designed with modular common structural components that could be connected together to form the spacecraft. Spacecraft components were largely chosen from 'off-the-shelf' sensors, actuators and avionics. The flight software was also designed using a layered modular approach leveraging model-based design concepts. High-level spacecraft control modules were autocoded from Simulink and integrated with reused executive and services modules and a small number of new hand-coded elements such as the software to control memory scrub hardware. The successful mission launched Sept 6, 2013 and was de-orbited and impacted the moon's surface on April 18, 2014. The spacecraft had 3 primary science instruments, the Lunar Dust Experiment, Neutral Mass Spectrometer, and the Ultra Violet Spectrometer. The mission also had a Laser Communications payload that set a record download rate of 622 MPS from the moon orbit. Over the course of the mission, LADEE had to tolerate a varying space radiation environment during a period of relative solar maximum and multiple passes through the Earth's Van Allen Radiation Belt. In order to mitigate this challenging environment, the Integrated Avionics Unit (IAU) chosen for the mission (a Broadreach Engineering RAD-750) implemented memory scrub in hardware. Software developed for the mission initialized and controlled the Error Detection and Correction (EDAC) circuitry and categorized and reported on errors that occurred during flight. The payloads, sensors and actuators each had varying degrees of tolerance to space radiation events, and events on these pieces of hardware were also tracked.

To that end, birch sawdust is efficiently delignified through simultaneous solvolysis and catalytic hydrogenolysis in the presence of a Ru on carbon catalyst (Ru/C) in methanol under a H2 atmosphere at elevated temperature, resulting in a carbohydrate pulp and a lignin oil. The lignin oil yields above 50% of phenolic monomers (mainly 4-n-propylguaiacol and 4-n-propylsyringol) and about 20% of a set of phenolic dimers, relative to the original lignin content, next to phenolic oligomers. The structural features of the lignin monomers, dimers and oligomers were identified by a combination of GC/MS, GPC and 2D HSQC NMR techniques, showing interesting functionalities for forthcoming polymer applications. The effect of several key parameters like temperature, reaction time, wood particle size, reactor loading, catalyst reusability and the influence of solvent and gas were examined in view of the phenolic product yield, the degree of delignification and the sugar retention as a first assessment of the techno-economic feasibility of this biorefinery process.

Porous boron nitride (BN) composed of light elements is considered as a promising candidate for pollution treatment due to its unique polarity of B-N bonds, high specific surface area, numerous structural defects, chemical stability, and oxidation resistance. However, the adsorption performance based on porous BN is hindered by either few activated sites or a low degree of crystallinity. In this work, we have developed a simple chemical method to activate pre-obtained well-crystallized porous BN fibers in acid solution. The successful chemical activation has been identified by FTIR spectra and zeta potential measurements. Benefiting from these advantageous features, the activated BN fibers with high stability exhibited enhanced cationic dye removal performance compared to the un-activated ones. The effects of pH value, contact time, temperature and adsorbent amount on the methylene blue (MB) adsorption properties were analyzed. The adsorption equilibrium data were interpreted in terms of Langmuir and Freundlich models and the results showed that Langmuir isotherms best represent the adsorption system. The maximum adsorbed amount for MB was as high as 392.2 mg g-1 at pH 8.0 and 30 °C. The adsorption rate was sharply enhanced after chemical activation. The excellent reusability of the activated BN was also confirmed. It is shown that chemical activation plays a key role in enhanced dye adsorption performance.

A slight decrease in activity of the recovered catalyst used in the proceeding rounds indicated the reusability of the catalyst. © 2015, Wuhan University of Technology and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","catalyst; mesoporous silica-zirconia; oxidative desulfurization; self-assembly; tungstophosphoric acid","Adsorption; Catalysts; Desulfurization; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Fuels; Gas adsorption; Mesoporous materials; Reusability; Self assembly; Silica; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Zirconia; Catalytic performance; Evaporation induced self assemblies; Mesoporous composites; Mesoporous Silica; Nitrogen adsorption desorption; Oxidative desulfurization; Supported phosphotungstic acids; Tungstophosphoric acid; Catalyst activity",Article,Scopus

SBA-15 particles with fibre, rod and cuboid morphologies of decreasing aspect ratio (12.1, 4.6 and 1.1), and increasing mesopore diameter (6.8, 6.8 and 11.4 nm), respectively, were synthesized, to understand the role of these structural parameters on enzyme activity and sensor performance. Microscopy and gas sorption experiments confirm that, as required, GOD (~7 nm size) immobilizes inside mesopores. Amongst all forms, cuboid SBA-15 showed the highest normalized absolute activity and reusability for at least six cycles. Thus, compared to rod SBA-15, an electrode with GOD immobilized-cuboid SBA-15 showed ten times higher sensitivity of 0.53 µA/cm2/mM, with a linearity range of 1.0–7.7 mM glucose and a short response time (&lt;5 s). Hence, structural features of the host could be directly related to the sensor performance. Therefore, in general, SBA-15 hosts with a smaller particle aspect ratio and a larger internal mesopore diameter (like cuboid), together with appropriate enzyme loading density and presence of ferrocene as an electron mediator, can ensure a superior biosensor performance. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Biosensor; Enzyme activity; Enzyme immobilization; Glucose oxidase; Mesoporous silica","Aspect ratio; Biosensors; Enzyme immobilization; Glucose; Glucose oxidase; Glucose sensors; Iron compounds; Organometallics; Reusability; Silica; Electron mediator; Mesoporous Silica; Mesoporous silica particles; Particle aspect ratios; Sensor performance; Short response time; Structural feature; Structural parameter; Enzyme activity",Article,Scopus

Shape-adaptive wind turbine blades are proposed as one of the solutions to these design constraints, as they can improve the performance of the blades under varying operating conditions without increasing the size of the blades. A novel Differential Stiffness Bend-Twist coupling (DSBT)1 concept is proposed in this paper to control the deformation behaviour of the blades. The DSBT concept achieves bend-twist coupling in the global structure while allowing the main deformation of the structural sub-components to remain in pure bending. By eliminating the need to design bend-twist coupled parts, this simplifies the material design and potentially enhances the manufacturability. An analytical conceptual model was developed to study the fundamental behaviour of DSBT structures under bending loads. The feasibility analysis demonstrated that the DSBT concept could achieve bend-twist coupling by altering the flexural stiffness distribution of stiffeners attached to the skin of the structure. A preliminary design scheme for the DSBT blades was also developed with the material design of stiffeners identified as an area to be optimised. The genetic algorithm (GA) was coupled with the Finite Element Method to search for the optimal flexure stiffness values. GA was reused to evaluate the required composite layup based on the stiffness requirements. Thus the design satisfies the requirements for strength and stiffness to enable DSBT. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The mission of this SRLV is to deliver 20,000 kg payload to an altitude of 50km and a velocity of Mach 8, and to be able to fly back to the original launch site. However, there is scarce knowledge about how to select proper configuration. Here, four alternatives with different aerodynamic shape and flow path geometry are evaluated and down selected according to some goals in given mission. A design methodology with corresponding software toolset is developed for the comparison study of configurations. The methods include: 1) an integrated aerodynamic/propulsion analysis method with 3D NS solver for outer flow and 1D Euler solver for inner flow simulation; 2) a structural optimization method with FEM solver for structural analysis and sizing; 3) an thermal protection system optimization method with panel based aero-heating analysis and 1D finite differentiation heat conduction analysis for TPS sizing; 4) a trajectory optimization process with gauss-pseudospectral method for mission and performance analysis.

A 9 ton Solid Rocket Motor is designed to function as the Booster Motor in this mission. This booster will carry the RLV-TD vehicle through the atmospheric regime. Electrical cables between the base shroud and the avionic packages mounted atop the Motor head end dome are routed along the 9 m length of the Motor using the welded pads over the Motor case, which is a general practice followed in many other Motors. Similarly, a pair of hydraulic lines will be laid along the length of the Motor connecting the control in actuation system in the base shroud and the oil reservoir positioned in the inter-stage. This system consists of a common hydraulic power plant that powers the actuators of both Solid Stage and TDV. The hydraulic fluid circulation to the Booster stage in actuators is through two stainless steel tubes. These tubes are routed over the clamping system placed over the welded pads on the Motor. A cowling assembly protects this assembly from aerodynamic effects in flight. The entire assembly has to be properly integrated to the Motor to take care of the various loads occurring during the ascent phase. The thinner cylindrical shell of the Motor case posed a challenge for this objective. Hence, detailed checks based on analytical and numerical approaches were necessary for ensuring the required margins in various components/sub assemblies. Detailed high fidelity 3-D model of Motor case with segment joint, welded pads, detachable pads, Teflon bush, cowling, fasteners etc. was used for the numerical analysis. Axial dilation of the Motor due to aerodynamic heating, geometric and contact non-linearities etc. were considered in the analysis. Analytical approach was used for estimating the design margins in the welds connecting the welded pad to Motor case using the loads estimated from analysis.

Looking to a fully reusable spaceplane in a longer timeframe, another step is needed to cover the reusability attribute, in-orbit operability and runway landing capability The Italian Aerospace Research Centre, in the framework of the national space program has carried out in the last decade studies on the USV winged re-entry spacecraft. Beside the design and in-flight experience gained in transonic-subsonic regime, in the last four years studies on a small scale re-entry vehicle called USV3 with conventional landing capability have been performed. The system shall be put in LEO orbit by the VEGA and shall perform scientific and technological experiments in orbit before re-entry. After de-boost the vehicle shall execute an autonomous reentry flight from hypersonic to subsonic regimes allowing terminal area energy maneuvering, approach and landing on conventional runways.

Comparing to the excellent results of IXV design, some system aspects may introduce the need for the acquisition of new enabling technologies: wings including TPS and actuation chains are needed to cover supersonic, transonic and subsonic flight up to landing together with suitable GNC approach capable to manage the autonomous flight from space to ground. A first issue of reduced curvature radius of wings with TPS must be addressed.

Within the broad OOS domain, the robotic refueling capability is definitely attractive as it would allow keeping operational in orbit platforms which could still keep working fruitfully but actually switched off because of fuel depletion; refueling capabilities are also envisaged to enhance usability of small LEO launchers: tugs dedicated to LEO-GEO payload transfer, permanently located in LEO and regularly refueled to accomplish the orbit transfers, would be available, relaxing the in orbit transportation current bottleneck. The design of On-Orbit Refueling (OOF) systems is intrinsically multi-disciplinary as structural interfaces, fluidic, thermo-dynamics control, material selection, relative dynamics and procedural aspects must be simultaneously taken into account and harmonized. As far as the mechanical interfaces are dealt with, two strategies can be traded-off: the docking and the berthing philosophies, the former of which has a strong heritage from the already flying solutions on the International Space Station (ISS), the latter having the strongest reference on the ISS robotic arms. Moreover, while the former heavily affect the design of the two space vehicle to be connected, the latter, at least on the target satellite, imposes lighter configuration requirements, opening the door to a larger set of applicability and reusability. The paper critically discusses the mechanical interface strategies, highlighting the re-usability of existing technologies for OOF design and implementation and their area of applicability and presents the rationale behind the technical requirements for the berthing strategy, more flexible and exploitable in OOS than the docking strategy. The berthing functionality is accomplished by a robotic arm which supports the fluidic line too, the end effector of which ensure the fuel line connection between the chaser and the target. A feasibility study run to assess the drivers and the sensible parameters to design a service module (chaser) to accomplish OOF. The fuel type to be transferred, the recipient inertial properties and attitude control authority, the operational orbits are assumed as parameters.

Often, adaptive reuse requires strengthening of the existing structure or reframing for new features within the building. In many cases, engineers must design new connections to the existing framing. To determine the capacity of the existing structure and the design constraints, conservative assumptions can be made, or steel coupons can be tested. Typically, this includes tensile testing to determine the yield strength of the steel and metallurgical-chemistry testing to determine the feasibility of welding. When testing shows that the existing steel has higher-than-expected strength or when chemical testing confirms that the steel is readily weldable, the extents of strengthening and the effort required to modify the framing can be minimized.

The necessity for multiaxial, thermomechanical fatigue testing of structural and engine materials, additional cyclic hardening and reduction in fatigue life observed under such service conditions, and ramifications of estimating multiaxial, thermomechanical fatigue life with isothermal multiaxial fatigue data at the greatest temperature of the cycle are discussed. Finally, some of the potential future challenges associated with experimental characterization of materials and fatigue life estimation under these complex but realistic service conditions are highlighted.

This was the case in the design of a new art gallery constructed within the footprint of an existing 1930s apartment building for which Thornton Tomasetti (TT) performed structural engineering services. Zoning restrictions necessitated preservation of the existing exterior masonry walls. A steel skeleton was constructed within the building for bracing before removing the existing floors, and the steel was repurposed in the final composite steel/concrete frame system. Fully encased composite steel beams and columns, and concrete pan joists, were deemed best suited for the high design loads (as much as 300 psf), staged construction, and minimal structural floor depths. Thermally broken connections between the new interior framing and existing walls were required by the owner to optimize building performance. Additional structural innovations included the implementation of push piles to support the existing wall, the excavation of a new basement four feet beneath the existing foundations, a 10-foot thermally broken cantilever at the roof level, and the conversion of a portion of the building into a 40-foot high atrium.

PANI was synthesized via chemical oxidation by using different ratio of sodium dioctyl sulfosuccinate (AOT) dopant. Simple techniques, such as Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray microscopy (EDX) and four-point probe were utilized to study the chemical structure of the resulted PANI and to understand the interaction between PANI and the analyte. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to study the morphology of PANI sample. The effect of dopant concentration on the performance of PANI sensor for hydrazine detection was investigated. The results showed a significant decrease in the absorption of polaron peak in UV-vis at ~780 nm. PANI with the highest ratio (Ani:AOT=5:7) of dopant in this study, worked as a highly sensitive sensor and gave fast response time within 0.12 min (7 s), compared to the PANI with lesser content (5:3 and 5:5) of dopants. The sensor responses were also evaluated based on the conductivity study, where PANI in the conducting state possessed conductivity in the range of 0.4-0.8 S/cm and it decreased upon immersion in various concentrations of hydrazine due to the dedoping process by hydrazine. FTIR analysis is useful to analyze the intensity ratio of quinoid/benzenoid in order to understand the structural changes occurring during hydrazine detection. However, all PANI, regardless on the difference of Ani/AOT ratio, showed good reusability up to 10 cycles. As a conclusion, PANI3 with the highest ratio of AOT dopant in the PANI matrix is chosen as the best chemical sensor among the synthesized PANI with good reusability for hydrazine detection. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the generation of waste derived from this sector has grown simultaneously, and consequently, improved ways of adding value, reusing, and disposing these waste materials are being sought. In this article, we present a new and innovative composite material based on vulcanized natural rubber (NR), carbon black (CB), and leather waste (NR/CB/leather). The NR/CB/leather composites were prepared by thermal compression with 60 phr of CB and 60 or 80 phr of leather waste. In accordance with Brazilian sanitary laws, we exposed these composites for 24 h to bleach (B) and a disinfectant with the aim of simulating a true everyday cleaning use. The deconvolution of the impedance semicircles was carried out, and two relaxation phenomena around linear relaxation frequencies of about 105 and 106 Hz were found and associated mainly with charge carriers from CB and leather waste. With the addition of leather, the electrical conductivity of the composites increased two orders of magnitude from 5.70 × 10-6 for the NR/CB to 7.97 × 10-4 S/cm for NR/CB/leather-60 phr B. These results point to the possibility of using these composites as an antistatic flooring once they exhibit acceptable values of electrical conductivity and once they withstand, from the structural, morphological, and electrical point of view, exposure to sanitizing agents. Furthermore, the production of these composites will add value to and enable an environmentally acceptable disposal of leather waste. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Applications; Composites; Elastomers; Properties and characterization; Rubber","Antistatic agents; Applications; Building materials; Composite materials; Elastomers; Electric conductivity; Floors; Leather; Rubber applications; Waste disposal; Electrical conductivity; Environmentally acceptable; Innovative materials; Leather tanneries; Linear relaxations; Orders of magnitude; Relaxation phenomena; Thermal compressions; Rubber",Article,Scopus

Masonry walls are traditionally composed of fired-clay bricks (solid or perforated) or blocks (concrete or earth-based), but in the past (and even in the present) they were often associated as needing an extra special thermal and acoustical insulation layer. However, over more recent years investigations on thermal and acoustical features has led to the development of new improved bricks and blocks that no longer need these insulation layers. Traditional masonry units (fired-clay bricks, concrete or earth-based blocks) that don't offer improved performance in terms of thermal and acoustical insulation are a symbol of a low-technology past, that are far removed from the demands of sustainable construction. This book provides an up-to-date state-of-the-art review on the eco-efficiency of masonry units, particular emphasis is placed on the design, properties, performance, durability and LCA of these materials. Since masonry units are also an excellent way to reuse bulk industrial waste the book will be important in the context of the Revised Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC which states that the minimum reuse and recycling targets for construction and demolition waste (CDW) should be at least 70% by 2020.

However, all AxByOz materials such as pyrochlores (A2B2O7)-referred to here as band-gap engineered composite oxide nanomaterials or BECONs-are traditionally prone to severe charge recombination at their surface. To alleviate the charge recombination, an effective strategy is to employ reduced graphene oxide (RGO) as a charge separator. The BECON and the RGO with oppositely charged functional groups attached to them can be integrated at the interface by employing a simple electrostatic self-assembly approach. As a case study, the approach is demonstrated using the Pt-free pyrochlore bismuth titanate (BTO) with RGO, and the application of the composite is investigated for the first time. When tested as a photocatalyst toward hydrogen production, an increase of ∼250% using BTO in the presence of RGO was observed. Further, photoelectrochemical measurements indicate an enhancement of ∼130% in the photocurrent with RGO inclusion. These two results firmly establish the viability of the electrostatic approach and the inclusion of RGO. The merits of the RGO addition is identified as (i) the RGO-assisted improvement in the separation of the photogenerated charges of BTO, (ii) the enhanced utilization of the charges in a photocatalytic process, and (iii) the maintenance of the BTO/RGO structural integrity after repeated use (established through reusability analysis). The success of the self-assembly strategy presented here lays the foundation for developing other forms of BECONs, belonging to perovskites (ABO3), sillenite (A12BO20), or delafossite (ABO2) groups, hitherto written off due to limited or no photoelectrochemicalactivity. © 2014 American Chemical Society.","bismuth titanate; energy conversion; photocatalysis; photoelectrochemical; reduced graphene oxide; semiconductors","Copper compounds; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electrochemistry; Electrostatics; Energy conversion; Energy gap; Graphene; Hydrogen production; Light absorption; Perovskite; Photocatalysis; Photocatalytic activity; Platinum compounds; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Reusability; Semiconductor materials; Bismuth titanate; Charged functional groups; Electrostatic self assembly; Photoelectrocatalytic activities; Photoelectrochemical measurements; Photoelectrochemicals; Reduced graphene oxides (RGO); Visible light absorption; Bismuth compounds",Article,Scopus

A reusability test to determine the practical usage of the catalyst was also investigated. The result revealed that the catalyst maintained an appreciable catalytic performance and stability in terms of its reusability after three cycle of reuse for the hydrolysis reaction. Also, the activation energy for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane complex was estimated to be 50.41kJmol-1, which is lower than the values of some of the reported catalyst. The catalyst can be considered as a promising candidate in developing highly efficient portable hydrogen generation systems such as PEMFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cells). © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Ammonia borane; Hydrogen; Hydrolysis; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes; Polydopamine","Activation energy; Alkalinity; Amines; Ammonia; Catalyst activity; Cobalt; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen; Hydrogen production; Hydrolysis; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanocatalysts; Nanoclusters; Nanotubes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Ammonia borane; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes; Physical chemical property; Polydopamine; Situ oxidative polymerization; TEM (transmission electron microscopy); Xrd (x ray diffraction); Catalyst supports; aqueous solution; carbon; catalyst; hydrogen; hydrolysis; nanotechnology; physicochemical property; power generation",Article,Scopus

Firstly, the machining features are recognized from an MBD model, which are taken as the machining semantics carrier. Then, the coupled machining feature cluster is introduced to construct the greater granularity’s independent structural element than machining feature, which describes the feature interactions. Finally, the MBD model is structured based on machining features and coupled machining feature clusters in a hierarchical way.

Particular attentions were paid to the factors of scale inhibition, and the changes of scale phase composition and morphology. The results showed that the addition of Zn2+ ions can effectively inhibit the process of corrosion, and then reduce scale growth. A dispersing agent was required to buffer against the adhesion of crude oil with the precipitates. The compound inhibitor (ratio of PBTCA, HEDP and ATMP, 2:2:1) achieved a higher efficiency of scale inhibition (97.34%) than any of the inhibitors individually. Moreover, structural anomalies of the crystals also revealed significant differences in the presence and absence of the compound inhibitor. The results proved that the pipelines first corrode, then, mechanical impurities, residual petroleum hydrocarbons and calcium scale gradually attach to the corrosion point to form a dirt scale layer. After n periods, a bedding black-and-white scale layer forms. During the field trial, it was found that dosing the compound inhibitor at 70ppm results in a 92.46% inhibition efficiency (IEs) at 85°C.

However, many of the current immobilization approaches face problems such as the requirement of tedious multi-step procedures, loss of enzyme activity during immobilization, and poor reusability. In this study, we chose poly-l-lysine (Ki) as a catalyst for silica mineralization and attempted a one-step ""leave to stand"" synthesis method under mild conditions, so as to simultaneously maintain both high enzymatic activity and reusability. To examine the effect of Kx on the enzymatic reaction of lipase, we performed hydrolysis of 2-octylacetate without adding a silica precursor. Results indicate that Kx hardly exerts adverse influence on the enzymatic activity of lipase. The lipase encapsulated in the silica gel prepared by leave to stand (Gelstand) retained 70% of the activity compared to the free solution, which is two times higher than that obtained by mixing (Gelmix). However, the Km value was found to be similar to that of free enzymes. These results suggest that the leave to stand is a suitable procedure for immobilization, without any decrease in the mass transfer of substrate. The Gel-stand sample retained 100% activity even after the 5th cycle, and retained above 95% of its activity after 4 h of heat treatment at 65 °C.

The structures and catalytic properties of the prepared hydrogels with different compositions were investigated in depth. Silver ions were demonstrated to have a catalytic effect on the polymer gelation reaction, which could thereby be dramatically accelerated. In addition, the low-temperature thermally functionalized graphene with a portion of oxygen functionalities and structural defects was found to play a key role in the formation of a high-performance composite hydrogel by its superior catalyst-carrying capacity and electron-transferring ability. The binary composite hydrogel without the functionalized graphene showed a much lower catalytic activity as compared to the ternary counterparts, and the catalytic performance of the ternary composite hydrogel could be further enhanced by loading a higher amount of the functionalized graphene. A new cross-linking network was evidenced to be formed after incorporation of the functionalized graphene, which could enable silver nanoparticles to be highly stabilized in the double cross-linking network matrix and thus led to the excellent reusability of the ternary composite hydrogel for several runs of catalytic reduction of different kinds of catalysants. The hydrogel catalyst could be handled much more conveniently for re-usage in different runs owing to its monolithic structure as compared to the conventional powdery catalysts. Moreover, the synergistic effects of the porous polymer network with adsorption capacity, functionalized graphene sheets having huge surface area for supporting a large number of silver nanoparticles and exceptional electron-transferring ability, and catalytically active silver nanoparticles were well demonstrated, along with a deep insight into the mechanism for the extraordinary catalytic performance of the ternary composite hydrogel. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.",,"Catalyst activity; Gelation; Graphene; Metal ions; Nanoparticles; Reusability; Silver; Synthesis (chemical); Adsorption capacities; Catalytic applications; Catalytic performance; Catalytic properties; Catalytic reduction; Functionalized graphene; Monolithic structures; Silver nanoparticles; Hydrogels",Article,Scopus

Several reaction parameters that affect the formation of the hybrid nanoflowers were investigated and a hierarchical flowerlike spherical structure with hundreds of nanopetals was obtained under the optimum synthetic conditions. The enzymatic activity of HRP embedded in hybrid naonflowers was evaluated based on the principle of HRP catalyzing the oxidation of o-phenylenediamine (OPD) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). The results showed that 506% enhancement of enzymatic activity in the hybrid nanoflowers could be achieved compared with the free HRP in solution. Taking advantages of the structural feature with catalytic property, a nanoflower-based colorimetric platform was newly designed and applied for fast and sensitive visual detection of H 2 O 2 and phenol. The limits of detection (LODs) for H 2 O 2 and phenol were as low as 0.5 μM and 1.0 μM by the naked-eye visualization, which meet the requirements of detection of both analytes in clinical diagnosis and environmental water. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the analysis of low-level H 2 O 2 in spiked human serum and phenol in sewage, respectively. The recoveries for all the determinations were higher than 92.6%. In addition, the hybrid nanoflowers exhibited excellent reusability and reproducibility in cycle analysis.

TEM results show average particle size 15-20 nm and 22-25 nm for Mn (1%) and Mn (2%) doped ZnO NPs respectively. Manganese (Mn) doping has led to reduction in band gap which facilitate the absorption of radiation in visible region. The Photocatalytic activity of undoped and Mn (0.5%,1%,1.5% and 2%) doped NPs was analyzed via degradation of crystal violet (CV) dye. The crystal violet decomposition rate of undoped and Mn doped NPs were studied under UV-visible region. It is observed from degradation studies that the doping has a pronounced effect on the photocatalytic activity of ZnO NPs. Kinetic studies shows that photo degradation of CV follow a pseudo first-order kinetic law. Experiments for reusability of Mn (1%) doped with PVP (1%) capped ZnO were also performed to determine the stability of as prepared sample.

The slabs were characterized according to their density and flexural strength. Economic viability analysis was also performed. The flexural strength of the reference slab was 31 kN, while the strengths of slabs using reusable packaging were 36-38 kN. A 20% reduction in mean density is another important advantage, because it reduces the weight for the manufacture, transportation and the total weight of the structure, thus reducing the cost of the structural design while facilitating the construction process. The direct costs of the materials required to manufacture the slabs were equivalent.

Catalytic performances of the powdered catalyst Bipy2PMoV1, as well as various control samples, were assessed in direct hydroxylation of benzene to phenol by O2 with a pressured titanium batch reactor.

The nanocomposite is used to form a modified bioelectrode by immobilizing cholesterol oxidase in the chitosan matrix and examined under an optical microscope for uniformity and morphological studies. A modified bioelectrode (ChOx/PAni-Au-CH/ITO) is used to detect cholesterol by using a voltammetric technique with a redox mediator. The sensor exhibits linearity in a wide range of 50-500 mg dL-1 with a detection limit of 37.89 mg dL-1, a sensitivity of 0.86 μA mg dL-1 and a shelf life of more than 3 weeks when stored at 4 °C.

N sulfuric acid-digestive destruction was incorporated with 10-24-h heating at 100. °C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and the polarized light microscopy (PLM) results have clearly shown that raw chrysotile asbestos was converted to non-asbestiform material with no crystallinity by the low temperature thermochemical treatment. As an alternative to the use of pricey sulfuric acid, waste sulfuric acid discharged from a semiconductor manufacturing process was reused for the asbestos-fracturing purpose, and it was found that similar removals could be obtained under the same experimental conditions, promising the practical applicability of thermochemical treatment of ACWs. A thermodynamic understanding based on the extraction rates of magnesium and silica from a chrysotile structure has revealed that the destruction of chrysotile by acid-digestion is greatly influenced by the reaction temperatures, showing a 80.3-fold increase in the reaction rate by raising the temperature by 30-100. °C.

This SRLV is designed to deliver a 20,000 kg payload to an altitude of 50km and a velocity of Mach 8, and to be able to fly back to the launch site. Compared with classical rocket launch vehicles and cruise vehicles, this vehicle applies unconventional configuration, flight path and propulsion working mode, and interactions between disciplines are very distinct. As there is scarce knowledge and data to refer to, we are faced with challenges in conceptual design. In this article, a two-phase design methodology is developed for RBCC powered vehicles. In the first phase, a sequential design flow with several design steps is utilized to find a feasible or near-feasible baseline. The methods used in this phase include: 1) a simplified trajectory for weight and sizing, 2) a multi-point optimization for aerodynamic shape design over a wide range of speeds, 3)a multi-point optimization for RBCC engine design to meet requirements of all working modes, 4) an integrated analysis process for aerodynamic/propulsion performance calculation, 5) a gauss-pseudo spectral based trajectory optimization to find the optimal flight path, 6) a structural design and sizing method, and 7) an automatic thermal protection system concept selection and sizing method. Also, considering the features of the vehicle, interactions between these steps are considered. With these methods and several iterations between them, the baseline of vehicle concept is created. In the second phase, Multi-Disciplinary Optimization (MDO) is applied to improve baseline for a feasible and better design. During this phase, optimization problem of SRLV, including design variables, constraints, and objectives, is created. The disciplinary high-fidelity models of and couplings between them are set up. By applying an asymmetric MDO architecture, the synthesis MDO model is integrated. Response Surface Method and Sequential Quadratic Programming algorithm are used in this architecture to find a closure and optimal solution. The application results from presented SRLV show that for a given launch task, the optimal design with all constraints satisfied can be found by this two-phase design methodology. We also find that this methodology is almost knowledge independent and suitable to conceptual design of unconventional vehicle like RBCC powered SRLV.",,"Aerodynamics; Aviation; Computer software reusability; Conceptual design; Engines; Flight paths; Launch vehicles; Machine design; Optimal systems; Quadratic programming; Reusability; Reusable rockets; Structural design; Design and optimization; Multi-disciplinary optimizations; Performance calculation; Reusable launch vehicles; Rocket based combined cycles; Sequential quadratic programming algorithm; Thermal Protection System; Trajectory optimization; Hypersonic vehicles",Conference Paper,Scopus

In the last step, this ZnO coating depicting dominant oxygen vacancies and significant grain boundaries was used as a seed on which single crystalline ZnO nanoneedles (average diameter and length of ∼25 nm and ∼600 nm, respectively) with high optical quality were hydrothermally grown. The detailed morphological and structural studies were performed on the resulting nanofibers, and the photocatalytic activity (PCA) was tested with reference to the degradation of methylene blue. The results of PCA were discussed in conjunction with photoluminescence response. The nanoneedle structures supported the vectorial transport of photo-charge carriers, which is crucial for high catalytic activity. The enhanced PCA, structural stability and reusability of the PAN/ZnO nanoneedles indicated that this hierarchical structure is a potential candidate for waste water treatment. © 2014 Materials Research Society.",,"Aromatic compounds; Catalyst activity; Coatings; Films; Functional materials; Grain boundaries; II-VI semiconductors; Nanofibers; Nanoneedles; Oxygen vacancies; Photocatalysis; Reusability; Stability; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Zinc oxide; Electrospun nanofibers; Hierarchical structures; Hydrothermal growth; Nanostructured ZnO; Photocatalytic activities; Photoluminescence response; Polycrystalline ZnO; Structural stabilities; Atomic layer deposition",Conference Paper,Scopus

Experimental testing of a hat-stiffened panel is performed to validate the FEA and idealized analytical solutions. This is an attempt to initiate a structural architecture methodology to speed the development and qualification of composite aircraft that will reduce design cost, increase the possibility of content reuse, and improve time-to-market. In particular, we compare FEA results with analytical solutions and develop a design methodology that will allow extensive reuse of parametric hat-stiffened panels in the design of composites structural components.

Current practices dictate that all required measurements are recorded by hand using tape measures and calipers which adds a significant cost to reused steel. To mitigate this cost, a semi-automated method for identifying structural steel components and systems is proposed that uses data acquired in the form of a 3D point cloud. Current research in the field of automated object recognition currently has two major limitations: (1) a priori knowledge, such as a building information model (BIM) is required, or (2) only simple, flat surfaces can be identified. The purpose of this study is to preliminarily investigate the possibility of automating the process of (1) cross section identification, (2) end connection geometry of bolted connections, and (3) relative component position of multi-component, planar structural systems such as trusses. Cross section identification is performed by creating filters that match standard structural sections and then convolving them over images of the cross section data. The end connection geometry is identified using Hough algorithms to detect lines and circles representing the limits of the component and the bolt holes, respectively. Planar structural systems are identified using Hough algorithms to detect lines which represent the components of the system. The results from the proposed methods show a strong potential for fully automated processes to be able to identify structural steel components and systems without a priori knowledge.","3D Imaging; Automation; Object Identification; Steel Reuse","Architectural design; Building materials; Filtration; Image matching; Object recognition; Robotics; Steel construction; Struts; 3D imaging; Automated identification; Automated object recognition; Building Information Model - BIM; Object identification; Structural sections; Structural steel components; Structural steel members; Automation",Conference Paper,Scopus

Protecting existing built environments through adaptive reuse proposals cannot be dismissed as a simple, nostalgic need to rebuild the past. On the contrary, seeing these proposals as an extension of a valuable architectural and cultural past allows greater insight into their aesthetic, structural, and cultural value. Within this perspective, the main aim of adaptive reuse proposals is to preserve contextual features, as well as the essence of existing spaces. This strategy of reclaiming original spatial conditions revises spatial norms through new technological improvements that take into account contemporary design issues, aspirations, and values. In this context, this paper focuses on the adaptive reuse of interior architecture in student projects produced during an exchange semester in the international master of interior architectural design (IMIAD) studio in Famagusta, Cyprus. In these projects, the students gave new functions to existing buildings and developed adaptive reuse proposals for five different locations, trying to find the essence of the existing buildings and transferring this to their design proposals.

With the ever increasing trend internationally to build structures and infrastructure sustainably, the use of structural steel has the ability to allow structures to be designed for both deconstructability and rehabilitation. Deconstruction techniques allow structures to be designed so that they may be conveniently dismantled in the future. This will allow potential reuse of recycling of steel for future use. Rehabilitation allows structures to have their life extended. Both deconstruction and rehabilitation techniques have the potential to significantly reduce the amount of use of structural steel in construction which has the potential to have significant benefits for sustainable construction methods. One of the key elements for developing solutions for the demountability and rehabilitation of steel and composite structures are the connections between the various structural elements. This paper will detail recent research into various aspects of shear connectors, beam-beam, beamcolumn and column-column connectors. Future research will also be detailed that will highlight the various loading regimes that these connections need to be designed for, in order to make them suitable for robust construction.","Composite structures; Demountability; Rehabilitation; Space structures; Steel structures","Building materials; Patient rehabilitation; Steel construction; Steel structures; Structure (composition); Demountability; Developing solutions; Rehabilitation techniques; Space structure; Steel and composite structures; Structural elements; Structural steels; Sustainable construction; Composite structures",Conference Paper,Scopus

Among stainless steels, ferritic and lean duplex grades are characterized by low nickel content resulting in a more cost-stable and economic material compared to austenitic stainless steels. These grades have comparable (or even higher) strength than carbon steel and good corrosion resistance at lower cost. That is why, lately, they have been more often used in structural components. In this paper, attention is first paid to the advantages associated with the use of stainless steel in recent construction projects in view of sustainability. Second, life cycle analysis and the background of the new European standard EN 15804 are introduced, including module D, which allows credits to be taken now for the eventual reuse or recycling of material in the future, at the end-of-life stage. Life cycle inventories of stainless steel products (cold-rolled coils and quarto plate) are presented. Depending on the fraction of material recovered at the end of the lifespan, two potential impacts (Primary Energy Demand and Global Warming Potential) are presented for four grades: 1.4301 (AISI 304) and 1.4401 (AISI 316) austenitic grades, 1.4016 (AISI 430) ferritic grade and 1.4462 (AISI 2205) duplex grade.

Through the examination of two cases - the restoration of Panayia tou Sinti Monastery in Paphos and the revival of Ayios Nicolaos Monastery in Orounda - the positive and negative consequences of the different philosophy and strategy followed in each case is demonstrated. With the involvement of the authors, the monastery of Panayia tou Sinti was partly restored in the form of ruins and became an open-air museum, whereas the monastery of Ayios Nicolaos underwent a comprehensive maintenance and new extensions were designed by the authors using appropriate materials and forms. Through these examples, the different concepts of conserving historic complexes - such as 'museum' conservation, final form of ruins, matters of authenticity, dynamic maintenance, compatibility of materials, structural reinforcement - are discussed. This paper demonstrates that before making final decisions for the strategy to be followed for the conservation of a historic abandoned building, investigation and assessment of all its values within the philosophical framework of international principles for rehabilitation should be conducted. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.","Abandonment; Monastery; Reconstruction; Rehabilitation; Reuse; Ruins",,Article,Scopus

In this system, columns are built up of H-SA700 plates using bolts only, and bolted connections are used extensively to allow structural components to be replaced or reused. Bolted beam-to-column connections using an end plate are developed for the system. Bolted stiffeners are devised to control yielding and local distortion of the column against local tension delivered by the beams. Four specimens, two with stiffeners proposed in this study and two without stiffeners, are tested under quasi-static cyclic loading. Finite element simulation is carried out to allow more detailed investigation on the yielding distribution in the connection. The specimens with the proposed stiffeners avoid the yielding and notable local distortion that occurred with the absence of the stiffeners. It is found that with the aid of the proposed stiffeners, the built-up column of H-SA700 steel would remain elastic and thus reusable even after major earthquakes.

This paper reports work on the synthesis of several catalysts for the conversion of glucose to methyl lactate. RESULTS: A MCM-41 type mesoporous material containing tin (Si/Sn=55) was developed with a uniform ordered mesoporous structure, high specific surface area and high pore volume. Sn-MCM-41 was tested in three consecutive catalytic cycles to evaluate its reusability giving methyl lactate yields of 43%, 41% and 39%, in each cycle. The slightly reduction in activity could be explained by the reduction in the accessibility of active centers due to the adsorption of reaction products and structural changes. Microporous titanosilicates and MFI-type zeolite ZSM-5 showed a lower catalytic performance, but exfoliated materials gave higher yields of methyl lactate and pyruvaldehyde dimethyl acetal than their respective layered precursors.

Thanks to its unique ability to use structural members under different curvatures and return bent elements to their initial straight or planar geometry, active bending has the potential to expand the existing morphology of transformable structures. This paper discusses the development of such structural and kinematical systems on a theoretical level. First we will give a review of the existing systems for transformable and active-bending structures. By combining these, we have developed new kinematical systems of which three were selected for the scope of this paper: deployable grids, active bending kit-ofparts systems and pliable textile hybrids. These will be discussed in more detail and applied on a first design case, illustrating the potential applicability in a real case. The kinematical study shows the potential of active bending in transformable structures. Using elastic deformations lowers the complexity of the structures and can be actively used in the structural transformation. However, questions about the structural behaviour and technical detailing remain for future research. © 2014 WIT Press.","Active bending; Deployable structures; Digital modeling; Kinematics; Transformable structures","Kinematics; Deployable structure; Digital model; Existing systems; First designs; Planar geometries; Real case; Structural behaviour; Structural transformation; Architectural acoustics; bending; construction material; construction method; deformation; kinematics; recycling; structural analysis; structural component; theoretical study",Conference Paper,Scopus

Composite steel-concrete structural systems are very popular for medium-sized office buildings, but deconstruction and re-use in deference to demolition is difficult because headed stud shear connectors in the composite slab and steel beam flooring system cannot be detached easily, and reuse is virtually impossible. As an alternative, it is proposed that precast concrete panels can be attached to steel beams using pre-tensioned bolts, instead of cast-in-situ floors with pre-welded headed stud connectors. The proposed floor system can be deconstructed by unbolting the precast panels, enabling recyclability of the system and providing significant advantages in a paradigm within the construction industry focussed on low emissions. This paper presents an analysis of this slab and beam system, with the composite beams comprising of two elastic elements connected at their interface by a stiff but finite frictional connection. Under loading, it is shown that three distinct lengthwise domains exist along the member, and a model for this is presented and discussed. © 2014 WIT Press.","Composite beams; Deconstructability; Friction-grip bolting; Partial interaction; Precast","Composite beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Connectors (structural); Construction industry; Floors; Friction; Office buildings; Precast concrete; Steel beams and girders; Studs (fasteners); Composite beam; Deconstructability; Friction-grip bolting; Partial interaction; Pre-cast; Loading; composite; concrete structure; construction industry; demolition; floor; friction; loading; numerical model; office location; steel structure; structural component; structural response",Conference Paper,Scopus

It is in such tragic moments that humanitarian organizations have an important task by providing shelter assistance for the affected population. Besides the family shelters that are provided for temporary housing, collective service tents are also necessary for field hospital, community centre, food,.... Although the current family shelters are adequate enough for the emergency use, there is a demand for better collective service tents because (i) the current tents are structurally complex which slows the building process, (ii) the current tents are not adaptable, (iii) after the initial emergency phase, these tents are not reused. The aim of this paper is to investigate a better alternative for collective service tents by using deployable constructions for the first emergency phase after a disaster, and by designing the component as such that they can be reused for a kit-of-part structure for the second phase of the disaster, i.e. the transitional phase. A first preliminary study is presented in this paper where the structural feasibility of the concept is tested. A barrel vault structure of 6m span and a height of 3m composed of scissor elements is modelled in a finite element program. The structure is then designed to fulfil the boundary conditions for the emergency phase. The components of the barrel vault structure are then used to introduce the idea behind the use of some static kit-of-parts structures for the transitional phase. The results are very promising. Together with experts from the field, we are very optimistic about the use of deployable shelters for humanitarian relief in order to propose a construction which can be used for the emergency and transitional phase of disaster relief. © 2014 WIT Press.","Barrel vault; Emergency shelters; Humanitarian relief; Kit-of-part structures; Optimisation; Scissor structure","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Emergency services; Tools; Barrel vault; Building process; Community centres; Emergency shelter; Finite element programs; Humanitarian relief; Optimisations; Transitional phase; Structural optimization; construction method; disaster relief; finite element method; optimization; recycling; structural analysis; structural component; technological development",Conference Paper,Scopus

It promises significant improvements in software quality and productivity by reducing implementation and testing time (with a consideration that prior testing and use has eliminated bugs) thereby making it cost effective. In this paper, we present an automation model for the identification and evaluation of reusable software to measure the software reusability levels (low, medium and high) of procedure-based object-oriented software systems. The presented approach uses a metric framework to compute functional analysis of object-oriented (OO)-based software components which take into account maintainability index to target essential attributes to predict reusability levels for reusability measurement. The presented approach works at the functional level rather than at the structural level. The performance of the presented automation model is recorded using criteria like precision, recall, accuracy and classification error.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) tests are conducted to investigate the transformation temperatures of FeNiCoTi alloy under different heat treatment methods and prestrain schemes. First, a heat treatment method is established to produce FeNiCoTi alloy with wide thermal hysteresis that is pertinent to civil structural applications. Next, recovery stress tests are conducted to explore the effect of parameters including heating method, heating temperature, heating rate, heating protocol and prestrain level on the recovery stress. An optimum prestrain level is determined based on the recovery stress results. Moreover, cyclic tests are carried out to examine the cyclic response of FeNiCoTi alloy after stress recovery. Thermal cyclic tests are also carried out on the FeNiCoTi alloy to better understand the effect of temperature variation on the recovery stress.

The objective was to ascertain whether strut-and-tie model provisions for efficiency factors of bottle-shaped struts in current design codes and the recent literature, originally meant for natural coarse aggregate concrete, can be conservatively applied to recycled concrete aggregate concrete, or not. The results of the re-analysis indicate that the efficiency factors of the natural coarse aggregate as well as the recycled concrete aggregate concrete bottle-shaped struts were comparable and conservative when benchmarked against the predictions of CSA A23.3-04 and an efficiency factor model proposed by the authors. However, both ACI 318-08 and Eurocode 2 gave unsafe efficiency factor predictions for the recycled concrete aggregate as well as the natural coarse aggregate concrete bottle-shaped struts under investigation. This is attributed to the insensitivity of these two codes to strut inclination with adjoining tie(s) and does not per se indicate any inherent inferiority as far as recycled concrete aggregate concrete is concerned.

This paper addresses the approach of the reuse of steel structure without melting which allows for savings in steel mass and the reduction of waste amounts offering moreover an opportunity to avoid environmental burdens related to the recycling process. Recent studies have stressed the technical feasibility of this strategy, which appears particularly effective in those countries in which a building's life is rather short, such as in Japan and US, though its application encounters more difficulties in most European countries, owing to longer building use. Besides stressing the architectural and structural feasibility of the above-mentioned strategy, this research work aims to quantify the mass savings that are achievable in this manner by presenting a real case study set in Italy. It consists in a railway station, which has been designed keeping in mind the partial employment of structural elements recovered from an old industrial building that is no longer in use. To estimate the amount of steel saved, two different structural models for the designed building have been carried out and compared. In the first one, the structure has been designed on the assumption of the reusing of recovered structural elements; in the second one, the same structure has been designed considering the use of new elements only. The final result of the analysis shows that steel reuse allowed for savings of up to 30% of steel. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The formulation uses the nonlinear vehicle dynamics with a spherical and rotating Earth, hard constraints for desired terminal conditions, and an innovative cost function having several components with associated weighting factors that can account for path and control constraints in a soft constraint manner, thereby leading to smooth solutions of the guidance parameters. The proposed guidance essentially shapes the trajectory of the vehicle by computing the necessary angle of attack and bank angle that the vehicle should execute. The path constraints are the structural load constraint, thermal load constraint, bounds on the angle of attack, and bounds on the bank angle. In addition, the terminal constraints include the three-dimensional position and velocity vector components at the end of the reentry. Whereas the angle-of-attack command is generated directly, the bank angle command is generated by first generating the required heading angle history and then using it in a dynamic inversion loop considering the heading angle dynamics. Such a two-loop synthesis of bank angle leads to better management of the vehicle trajectory and avoids mathematical complexity as well. Moreover, all bank angle maneuvers have been confined to the middle of the trajectory and the vehicle ends the reentry segment with near-zero bank angle, which is quite desirable.

Part of their success is due to their balanced compromise between performance and flexibility, but also because of their capability for exploiting the dynamic reconfiguration. However, the costly reconfiguration process and the lack of management support have prevented a broader use of the FPGAs. In order to contribute to solve these issues, in this paper we propose a software/hardware dynamic resource management system that combines scheduling and placement tasks, providing a complete management flow for supporting dynamically reconfigurable hardware designs. One of the advantages of the proposed model is the capability for running its scheduling and placement tasks in different nodes, as part of a distributed network.

Based on these findings a guideline has been formulated for the use of upgraded incinerator bottom ash in ready-mixed as well as precast concrete. Although the upgraded bottom ash is of better quality then the original bottom ash, some properties still need special attention (i.e. must meet additional requirements): particle density, metallic aluminium content, loss on ignition, chloride, sulphate and alkali content and, finally, constituents which alter the setting and hardening of the cement.

The pier's rehabilitation design and subsequent construction posed many challenges, none the least of which was its remote location in the West Central Pacific Ocean. Included in the design considerations was the requirement to provide a ""building blocks"" design to best facilitate the potential construction by the U.S. Navy Seabees, as well as to account for the inherent difficulties of on-site fabrication and to make optimum use of prefabricated elements to enhance constructability. Due to the nature of the available funding and the desire to achieve sustainable design goals, maximizing reuse of all acceptable existing construction played a role, all the while satisfying the stated desire to improve facility configuration and capacity to better serve the mission and the operations of the Missile Defense Command. Furthermore, there was the mandate to provide a design that would afford a minimum 75-year service life for the new facility and have minimal overall environmental impact. This led to a number of innovative design considerations that included specially formulated, high-strength, galvanized reinforced, precast concrete components; employing galvanized structural steel construction with a ""forgiving"" system of connections to best facilitate the arrangement of the existing piling being retained; a carefully controlled dredging and spoils collection scenario to best accommodate future vessel operations and avoid adverse impact on the sensitive surrounding marine environment; a sophisticated spill containment system that would afford the required environmental protection but require minimal maintenance from installation forces; and a concerted effort to maximize the use of recycled and local resources.

It allows for the creation of flexible geometric models using parameters for dimensions and makes it possible to define numeric relationships between these parameters by means of mathematical formulas and define geometric-topological constraints between geometric entities. The result is a flexible geometric model that can be steered through the manipulation of its primary parameters. In contrast to explicit geometric models with fixed dimensions, a parametric model can capture the design intent and represent domain knowledge. The use of parametric modeling techniques is particularly beneficial for designing bridges. This is because the geometric design of bridges is mainly determined by external constraints resulting from the size and the layout of both the overlying and the undercrossing carriageway. This reduces the effort required for reworking when changes are made, while simultaneously providing a high degree of reusability for the model in other, similar projects, resulting in significantly increased efficiency in the bridge design process. Because of the strong fragmentation of the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, the data exchange between the different participants in a construction project is of crucial importance. The use of neutral, open data formats has proved to be the most suitable approach to realize this data exchange. However, currently existing neutral data formats do not allow for an exchange of parametric geometry. To overcome these technical limitations, this paper introduces an extension to the IFC-Bridge format, thus providing a means of interchanging parametric bridge models. This article describes in detail the necessary entities introduced to define parameters and capture dimensional and geometric constraints. The suitability of the developed extensions is proved by presenting the successful transfer of parametric bridge models between two parametric design systems as well as from a design system to a structural analysis system. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.","3D bridge modeling; IFC-Bridge; Industry Foundation Classes; Infrastructure modeling; Interoperability; Neutral data exchange format; Parametric geometry","3d bridge models; Data exchange format; IFC-Bridge; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Infrastructure modeling; Parametric geometries; Design; Electronic data interchange; Geometry; Interoperability; Reusability; Bridges",Conference Paper,Scopus

RLV plays an important role in controlling the cost of space transportation and performing the orbital mission. Since RLV would suffer from the aerodynamic heating inevitably during reentry, the thermal protection system (TPS) is designed to prevent too much heat transmitting to the vehicle structure and maintain the vehicle structure below a specified temperature limit. Several studies were performed to develop an understanding of not only the thermal and structural analysis of ceramic tile thermal protection system on the space shuttle but also the controlling factors of TPS. The TPS is subjected to the reentry heating and pressure profile of the Access to Space vehicle, and the transient temperature distribution and the resultant thermal stresses in the system are computed. Comparisons between various studies based on different assumptions were examined. By comparing these results with more realistic ones, the differences are evaluated. Results suggest that the TPS analysis must be based on reasonable and realistic parameters. Thus, engineers have to keep in mind that all parameters should be chosen very carefully to achieve results that close to practical ones. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Finite element method (FEM); Optimization analysis; Reusable launch vehicles (RLV); Thermal protection system (TPS); Transient heat transfer","Access to space vehicles; Optimization analysis; Re-usable launch vehicles (RLV); Thermal and structural analysis; Thermal Protection System; Thermo-mechanical analysis; Transient heat transfer; Transient temperature distributions; Finite element method; Launching; Reusability; Reusable rockets; Space shuttles; Thermal insulating materials; Heat shielding",Conference Paper,Scopus

The sorption of Cu(II) ions by batch method is carried out. The optimum conditions of biosorption were found to be: a biomass dose of 0.4 g in 100 ml of Cu(II), contact time of 100 min and pH 6, respectively. In optimum condition, removal efficiency was 88.45%. Meanwhile, the maximum adsorption capacity was 73.26 mg g-1. Four equations, i.e. Morris-Weber, Lagergren, Elovich and pseudo second order have been tested to track the kinetics of removal process. The data are well described by pseudo-second-order model. The Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevic (D-R) are subjected to sorption data to estimate sorption capacity, and the Langmuir shows the high performance in the fitting of equilibrium data. It can be concluded that S. bevanom has potential to remove Cu(II) ions from aqueous solutions at different concentrations. Also, it achieved 75% desorption efficiency using 0.1 M HCl, and reusing of adsorbent shows high ability in the Cu(II) removal from aqueous solution. The removal of Cu(II) by S. bevanom was also investigated in a fixed bed column.

An aeroheating verification and validation case is first conducted on a Mach 6.5+ spherical dome protuberance that was tested in a NASA wind tunnel by Glass and Hunt [1986] and was also computationally simulated by Ostoich et al. [2011, 2012]. ATA's simulation includes aerothermoelasticity in the physics and captures the heating of the compliant dome structure during the first five seconds of exposure to hypersonic flow. This case is followed by a coupled quasi-static aerothermoelastic analysis of an acreage panel-level structural component for a sustained, reusable, air-breathing Mach 5-7 cruise horizontal-takeoff platform. A notional hypersonic vehicle (NHV) has been defined, and analyses are underway for two panels based on recent industry detailed designs. The panels were consistent with the NHV outer mold line (OML), allowing the fully coupled simulation of two realistic structures in a realistic hypersonic environment. The paper presents results from a first quasi-static simulation of an orthogrid stiffened, curved panel that bows into the flow due to thermal stress and an assumed internal pressure. The effect of the stiffeners on the panel's response is profound and includes global and localized bowing relative to the undeformed panel and vehicle OML, resulting in the generation of multiple shock structures. The longterm vision of the analysis framework is to enable accurate, quantitative assessment of panels in regions where improper accounting of nonlinear coupling makes structural response and life prediction problematic and may lead to excessive structural risk and/or weight as a result of excessive conservatism. © 2012 AIAA.",,"Aerothermoelasticity; Analysis frameworks; Computational framework; Extreme environment; Multi-physics analysis; Quantitative assessments; Structural component; Verification and validation; Domes; Hypersonic aerodynamics; Hypersonic flow; NASA; Risk assessment; Structural dynamics; Hypersonic vehicles",Conference Paper,Scopus

To enable semantic ontology mapping, this research proposes conflict detection and resolution techniques for both semantic and structural conflicts. The Semantic Bridge Ontology has been proposed as a core component for generating mapping rules to reconcile terms defined in local ontologies into terms defined in the target common ontology.

However, the relationship between their dimensionality and photocatalytic activity was rarely investigated. In this study, a series of TiO2-based nanostructures in various dimensionalities (such as nanosheets, nanotubes) were obtained by hydrothermal treatment of P25, and the process of structural evolution was also systematically investigated by TEM, BET, Raman, and XRD analysis. Much higher rate constant (3.7 × 10 -2 min-1) for the degradation of rhodamine B was found for nanosheets, comparing with those of three-dimensional P25 nanoparticles (0.59 × 10-2 min-1) and one-dimensional nanotubes (0.85 × 10-2 min-1). It is found that the hydrothermally prepared TiO2-based nanosheets possess small thickness (ca. 5 nm) and plentiful surface hydroxyl groups, and the reason why TiO2-based nanosheets possess superior photocatalytic activity is also discussed in detail from the microstructure and surface chemical states.

The UFSs were physically and chemically characterized and then added to mortars and concretes as fine aggregate replacement at increasing dosages (ranging from 0% to 30% by weight). Different water-cement ratios w/c as well as the addition of previously washed UFSs were also considered. The resulting washing waters were used to manufacture cement pastes in order to investigate the effect of soluble UFSs ions on the hydration kinetics of cement. Leaching tests in de-ionized water were realized in order to assess the environmental impact of the final materials. The main results show that UFS properties are very dependent on their source, even in the same foundry. The reduction in compressive strength is greater when lower w/c are adopted. High content of soluble alkaline ions in UFS can induce an accelerating effect in cement hydration. However, if previously washed UFS is employed, the accelerating effect at shorter curing time is eliminated and the reduction in mechanical performance at longer curing time partially recovered.

Results: The adsorption properties of calcined alunite for Acid Red 88 were investigated. pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time and ionic strength were found to influence the adsorption. Temperature did not significantly affect the process. Kinetic data obey a pseudo-second-order model, while intraparticle diffusion is not the only rate-limiting step. The Langmuir isotherm well described the equilibrium data. The monolayer adsorption capacity of calcined alunite was found to be 832.81 mg g-1. It was successfully used for the removal of dye in continuous mode at a flow rate of 4.0 mL min-1. Co-anions affected the adsorption capacity of calcined alunite but the presence of other organic compounds in the same medium did not significantly change the adsorption performance. Reusability studies showed that the calcined alunite can be reused four times. Electrostatic interaction, ion-exchange and complexation were found to be effective mechanisms for the adsorption of Acid Red 88 by calcined alunite.

An aeroheating verification and validation case is first conducted on a Mach 6.5+ spherical dome protuberance that was tested in a NASA wind tunnel by Glass and Hunt [1986] and was also computationally simulated by Ostoich et al. [2011, 2012]. ATA's simulation includes aerothermoelasticity in the physics and captures the heating of the compliant dome structure during the first five seconds of exposure to hypersonic flow. This case is followed by a coupled quasi-static aerothermoelastic analysis of an acreage panel-level structural component for a sustained, reusable, air-breathing Mach 5-7 cruise horizontal-takeoff platform. A notional hypersonic vehicle (NHV) has been defined, and analyses are underway for two panels based on recent industry detailed designs. The panels were consistent with the NHV outer mold line (OML), allowing the fully coupled simulation of two realistic structures in a realistic hypersonic environment. The paper presents results from a first quasi-static simulation of an orthogrid stiffened, curved panel that bows into the flow due to thermal stress and an assumed internal pressure. The effect of the stiffeners on the panel's response is profound and includes global and localized bowing relative to the undeformed panel and vehicle OML, resulting in the generation of multiple shock structures. The longterm vision of the analysis framework is to enable accurate, quantitative assessment of panels in regions where improper accounting of nonlinear coupling makes structural response and life prediction problematic and may lead to excessive structural risk and/or weight as a result of excessive conservatism. © 2013 by ATA Engineering, Inc.",,"Domes; Hypersonic aerodynamics; Hypersonic flow; NASA; Risk assessment; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Wind tunnels; Aerothermoelasticity; Computational framework; Extreme environment; Multi-physics analysis; Quantitative assessments; Structural component; Structural response; Verification-and-validation; Hypersonic vehicles",Conference Paper,Scopus

BIM is used to create a model that is not only a geometrical representation of a facility but also a representation of information and properties that can be used by the parties involved in the project. The proposed framework calculates life cycle cost (LCC) of projects and LEED score. It utilizes Genetic Algorithms (GA) Optimization as a decision making tool to select the optimum buildingmaterials. The proposed framework expands thematerials library in BIM softwares. It also expands BIM capabilities using BIM Application Programming Interface (API) in order to integrate BIM with the developed GA model. This integration allows extracting data from BIM model directly to GA model, importing the optimization results to BIM model, and modifying BIM model based on these results.

Controlled properties of joints of prefabricated bar (column, girder, beam), planar (walls, floor plates) and spatial units allow eliminating, to a certain extent, the dynamic and seismic effects caused by human activity, traffic, building and production activity, or natural effects. Besides the limitation of the intensity of dynamic effects to a level that will not cause the failure of a building and its parts due to compensation elements inserted into the joints, capable of absorbing energy with specified dynamic characteristics, another significant property of these joints is the elimination of outside noise below the absolute threshold of hearing and thus the enhancement of the quality of the internal environment, allowing potential development in areas with increased noise levels.

Extending current practices for seismic assessment to these buildings is not straightforward, as, in contrast with conventional frame structures, they are characterised by distributed stiffness and mass and poor diaphragm action. Interventions are often restricted by international treaties for non-invasiveness and reversibility of the intervention - given the practical requirements for the buildings' intended reuse. Poor understanding of the mechanics of masonry and the inherent brittleness of the material further compounds the uncertainties in analytical methods used for assessment and rehabilitation. Simplified procedures that produce dependable results for estimating seismic demand for this class of structures are a primary objective of this paper. In a displacementbased context, requirements are determined from the spectral acceleration and displacement at the end of the constant acceleration range, Tc, in light of the fact that these structures seldom exceed two storeys in height above ground. Displacement demand at the reference point is then distributed through the structure following a simplified estimate of the fundamental mode of vibration; this is calculated in each of the two principal directions of the building in plan, by applying a lateral load distribution analogous to its mass distribution. The intensity of local demand and likelihood of damage are estimated as relative drift ratios, in plan and in height, of the masonry piers of the structure. A case study of two neoclassical buildings damaged in the 1978 earthquake in Thessaloniki are used as a point of reference for illustration of concepts - results are correlated based on their ability to reproduce the patterns of damage observed during post-earthquake reconnaissance evaluations of the building.","Heritage buildings; Masonry buildings; Seismic assessment","Civil engineering; Computational methods; Earthquakes; Engineering geology; Fracture mechanics; Masonry construction; Masonry materials; Reinforced concrete; Structural dynamics; Heritage buildings; International treaties; Lateral load distributions; Masonry building; Post-earthquake reconnaissances; Practical requirements; Seismic assessment; Spectral acceleration; Buildings",Conference Paper,Scopus

It was concluded that the points related to the structural credits are roughly proportional to the cost of structural elements in buildings. However, participation of structural engineers in the sustainability efforts is disproportionally low based on the percentage of structural engineers holding LEED Accredited Professionals (LEED AP) designation. Embodied and total energy requirements of typical buildings were examined and it was concluded that embodied energy in the structural components has a share ranging from 2% for traditional buildings to 25% for net-zero buildings. Finally, the sustainability aspects related to structural design that are currently ignored in the rating systems were identified and discussed. Such aspects include: baseline material usage, structural robustness and resilience to disasters, structural adaptability and reuse, structural durability and longevity. It was emphasised that a structure can be sustainable, in true spirit of the terminology, without achieving significant points in the rating systems as long it satisfies the guiding principle of reducing burden on natural resources and the environment. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","Embodied energy; Green buildings; Rating systems; Structural durability; Structural engineers; Structural robustness; Sustainable development","Buildings; Durability; Engineers; Planning; Rating; Structural design; Sustainable development; Embodied energy; Green buildings; Rating system; Structural durability; Structural engineer; Structural robustness; Environmental design",Article,Scopus

Many jobbing foundries are constrained in furnace types and available foundry additives that the operation always results in white irons. This study is towards ensuring grey iron is reproduced from cast iron scrap auto engine blocks, when using a diesel fired rotary furnace and a FeSi alloy for structural modification (inoculation). With varying addition rate of the FeSi alloy to the tapped molten metal, chill wedge tests were performed on two different wedge samples of type W (according to ASTM A367- wedge test) with cooling modulus of 0.45 cm (W 31/2) and 0.54 cm (W4). The carbon equivalents for the test casts were within hypoeutectic range (3.85 wt. (%) to 4.11 wt. (%)). In the W4 wedge sample, at 2.0 wt. (%) addition rate of the FeSi alloy, the relative clear chill was totally reduced to zero from 19.76%, while the relative mottled chill was brought down to 9.59% from 33.71%. The microstructure from the cast at this level of addition was free of carbidic phases; it shows randomly oriented graphite flakes evenly distributed in the iron matrix. Hardness assessment shows that increasing rate of FeSi addition results in decreasing hardness, with maximum effect at 2.0 wt. (%) addition. With equivalent aspect ratio (cooling modulus) in a target cast product, this addition rate for this FeSi alloy under this furnace condition will attain graphitized microstructure in the cast product.","Chilling; Grey cast iron; Inoculation; Reuse","Carbon equivalent; Chilling tendencies; Graphite flakes; Grey cast iron; Inoculation; Reuse; Rotary furnace; Structural modifications; Alloys; Aspect ratio; Chilling; Foundries; Hardness; Iron; Liquid metals; Microstructure; Tungsten; Cast iron",Article,Scopus

Therefore, the appropriate evolution routes of residential buildings need balancing their carbon emission and value creation, which is realized in this paper by creating a new concept of life-cycle carbon efficiency and its relative methodology. First, the life-cycle carbon efficiency of a residential building is defined as the ratio of its life-cycle value to carbon emission, and the life-cycle of a residential building is divided into five stages, including construction materials preparation, building construction, building operation, building demolition, and construction &amp; demolition wastes disposal. Second, the life-cycle carbon emission of a residential building is estimated through calculating the carbon emission at each stage based on its consumed energy and resources. Third, the product of the service life span of a residential building (in year), its building area (m2) and its storey height (m) is recommended to represent its life-cycle value, since this product is a physical measure and more useful to develop action plans to improve its performance. In the end, the proposed methodology is exemplified in estimating the life-cycle carbon efficiency of a five-storey brick-concrete residential building in Nanjing city (China) at its design phase. Possible measures to enhance the estimated carbon efficiency are further put forward, such as prolonging the service life span, enhancing 3R (reduce, reuse and recycle) principles of cement and rolled steel, saving electricity and natural gas at the stage of building operation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon efficiency; Carbon emission; Life-cycle assessment; Residential building; Residential property value","Carbon efficiency; Carbon emissions; Life-cycle assessments; Property value; Residential building; Building materials; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Demolition; Economics; Structural design; Life cycle; action plan; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; life cycle analysis; multistorey building; waste management; building; building construction; construction material; construction method; residential location; China; Fujian; Nanjing [Fujian]; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,Scopus

However the available research on structural and material performance of high strength steels and very high strength steels is very limited in literature, especially for very high strength steels. The potential advantage and low research level of very high strength steels call for more researches. The steel members made of very high strength steels in constructions are sometimes inevitably exposed to fire hazards, after fire whether they are reusable or not, it needs a reliable evaluation. In order to reveal post-fire material performance of very high strength steel S960, an experimental study was carried out, which serves for the evaluation of post-fire performance of structures with components made of S960. Tensile tests were undertaken on specimens made of S960 after cooling down from temperatures up to 1000 °C. Its post-fire elastic modulus, yield strength, ultimate strength, and stress-strain curves were obtained. It is found that the post-fire performance of structural steels is dependent on steel grade.

The construction sector is one of the key areas of intervention, which carries a high consumption of resources such as materials, energy, and water. Thus, it is essential to adopt more efficient actions during all stages of the construction process, including the use of more sustainable materials. The reuse of different types of waste in the construction or rehabilitation of buildings can contribute significantly to sustainability. In this research work, the potential applicability of woven fabric waste (WFW) and a waste of this residue, named woven fabric subwaste (WFS), as thermal insulation building material was studied. Experimental work was conducted using an external double wall, with the air-box filled with these two types of waste, to determine their thermal characteristics. Two heat flowmeters and four surface temperatures sensors were placed on the wall surface to determine the thermal conductivity of the wastes. The obtained results show that the application of the WFW and WFS in the external double wall increases its thermal behavior in 56% and 30%, respectively. The thermal conductivity value of the WFW is similar to the values obtain for expanded polystyrene (EPS), extruded polystyrene (XPS) and mineral wool (MW). The value of this parameter for the WFS is approximately equal to the values for granules of clay, vermiculite or expanded perlite. Therefore, applying these wastes as a possible thermal insulation material seems to be an adequate solution. Environmental, sustainable and economical advantages may result from this practice. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In our ongoing pediatric oncogenomics study, we have sequenced over 120 childhood acute lymphoblastic (ALL) quartets (matched normal-tumor, father, mother). ALL is the most common pediatric cancer and leading cause of cancer-related deaths among children, however its underlying causes remain largely unknown. We set out to build a comprehensive catalogue of genomic (sequence and structural) as well as epigenomic variations involved in childhood ALL, through deep exome resequencing, as well as transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq), genome-wide genotyping, as well as arraybased methylation profiling. In response to the important challenge of integrating these various sources of information, we have created a flexible database system to effectively manage these ambitious datasets. In particular, we have implemented a custom Next-Generation childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia relational Database (ngALL DB) to report workflow analyses and integrate whole-exome sequencing data. This database also provides progress reports, allowing the user to track the samples through the project pipeline from the biospecimen repository to the annotated SNP list output. Moreover, it provides information about the different bioinformatics tools, sequencing runs and computing platforms used for mapping, cleaning and analyzing the data. The database design's flexibility and reusability facilitates data integration and allows for a customizable analytical approach and execution of custom structured queries. Complex queries and procedures can be written to interrogate the database and analyse virtually any aspect of the integrated NGS, genomic and epigenomic data. Furthermore, as the main goal of our project is to identify the full complement of genetic variants (inherited and somatic) involved in childhood ALL, the ngALL DB is linked to a high-resolution annotation database where each position in the genome is represented with detailed functional annotation. This integrated database structure offers a flexible framework to compile and characterize the large amounts of data generated from NGS studies, providing a powerful research tool for the identification of causal variants in childhood ALL.","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia; Data management; Database; Genetic variants; MySQL; Next generation sequencing; Pediatric oncogenomics","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia; Analytical approach; Bioinformatics tools; Childhood leukemia; Complex queries; Computing platform; Customizable; Data integration; Data sets; Database design; Flexible framework; Functional annotation; Genetic variants; Genotyping; High resolution; Integrated database; Large amounts of data; Massive data sets; MySQL; Next generation sequencing; Pediatric cancer; Progress report; Relational Database; Research tools; Resequencing; Structured queries; Transcriptome analysis; Underlying cause; Workflow analysis; Alkylation; Bioinformatics; Database systems; Diseases; Genes; Pediatrics; Reusability; RNA; Scheduling; Information management",Conference Paper,Scopus

We successfully performed free-radical polymerization of acrylamide (AAm) over expanded perlite (EP). We cross-linked expanded perlite with acrylamide to enhance its chemical resistance. P(AAm-EP) composite has a specific surface area of 31.7m2/g. We evaluated the composite of adsorptive features for Tb3+ in light of the dependency of the ion concentration, pH, temperature, time, and reusability. The composite was able to bind Tb3+ ions with strong chemical affinity. The adsorption results were fitted to the classical Langmuir, Freundlich, and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) sorption models. The composite was used in the removal studies of the Tb3+ ions. The adsorption of Tb3+ ions increased as the pH increased and reached a plateau value at around pH 3.0.

An important finding is that 75% of the engineers/energy modelers surveyed believed that their models could be used by a third party in building commissioning and operation. At the same time, many modelers voiced various reservations that might prevent them from sharing their energy models with the owner or design team. These reservations varied from a desire to protect their intellectual property, to liability concerns, to the fear of incurring additional unpaid work.

The degradation was achieved without initial pH adjustments to avoid the interference of buffering on the degradation kinetics. The degradation process was optimized to minimize the superfluous scavenging effect of excess dosage of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and AMKC on the kinetics study. The presence of Fe was confirmed by X-ray diffraction, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, XRF and EDX results. Brunauer-Emmet-Teller result showed an increment in the surface area from 19 to 45m2/g after the acid modification which led to structural and morphological changes as revealed by the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The best optimization result of the degradation of phenol obtained from the desirability plot gave 18.2% excess HP, 2.23g of AMKC as the best condition to achieve 99.15% degradation of 100ppm initial concentration of phenol at 30°C in 5min reaction time. Strong correlation between the experimental and predicted responses was observed with R2 and Radj2 values of 0.9921 and 0.9810, respectively. In the kinetic study, degradation rate 50ppm is 1.38 times faster than 200ppm while the selectivity of AMKC for direct oxidation of phenol is 3.4 times higher than through intermediates. Only about 4% drop in catalyst activity was observed during the reusability studies after five experiments.

This means that such structures should be able to withstand high temperatures engendered by aero-thermal re-entry fluxes due to the establishment of a hypersonic regime over the body. Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) are used to maintain a reusable launch vehicle structural temperature within acceptable limits during re-entry flights; that is internal temperature should not be higher than the limit required by the internal structure. TPS are usually composed of several layers of different materials. Heat transfer through a multilayer insulation during atmospheric re-entry involves combined modes of heat transfer: heat conduction and radiation through the solid, heat radiation to the outer space etc. In the framework of the TPS design activities, a procedure based on one-dimensional analytical solutions of transient non-linear analysis has been developed in order to estimate the temperature variation with time and space of a multi-layered body subjected to aerodynamic heating inside a radiating space. Furthermore a semi-analytical procedure, able to take also into account non-linear thermal properties, has been conceived. Since internal temperature values of TPS of re-entry vehicles cannot exceed certain values, these procedures allow to quickly evaluate these temperature values and the preliminary size layer thicknesses without resorting to numerical solutions. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However the post-fire mechanical properties of high strength steels have not been reported in the literature. Hence, there is an urgent need to understand the mechanical properties of high strength steels after cooling down from fire.

Tensile coupon tests were undertaken on two commonly used high strength steel grades S460 and S690 after cooling down from elevated temperatures up to 1000 °C. The post-fire elastic modulus, yield and ultimate strengths, ductility and stress-strain curves were obtained from this study. It is found that the post-fire mechanical properties of high strength steels are different from that of mild steels.

The choice of the re-entry test conditions for the design and develop is due to the fact that this is the most severe of the overall hypersonic flight mission. Another key factor for the ASA Panel reusability is its oxidation resistance. The application of a good in quality coating has been tested and studied in order to guarantee the material chemical stability. The project requirements take into consideration the harsh condition of a re-entry mission. It is thought that this developed thermal protection system (TPS) has to be installed on the IXV vehicle. The development of this structure includes also the design and development, performed by Thales Alenia Space Italia, of clamping devices that can lock the panel to the IXV vehicle. The whole designed system, TPS and lock system, has been realized. In particular, a specific set of characterization and functional test has been performed in order to assess the technologies readiness level and qualify the component for a re-entry nominal mission. Here the whole system is presented showing its capacity to withstand with IXV requirements. The patented structure is a sandwich structure composed by four tiles. One of the innovations of this TPS is the opportunity to be installed/uninstalled externally without the necessity to have an access from the inner part of the vehicle. The use of advanced carbon/carbon materials let the structure to be not only lightweight but also to be reusable and to keep its mechanical properties during the overall mission. © 2012 by Thales Alenia Space Italia.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Chemical stability; Computer software reusability; Earth atmosphere; Heat shielding; Hypersonic aerodynamics; Locks (fasteners); Oxidation resistance; Reentry; Reusability; Thermal insulating materials; Atmospheric re-entry; Design and Development; Italian Space Agency; Structural assemblies; Structural function; Thermal protection; Thermal Protection System; University of Rome; Hypersonic vehicles",Conference Paper,Scopus

One figure of merit correlates to the effectiveness of the heat capacity of the underlying structural material in reducing the amount of required insulation. The second figure of merit provides an indicator of the mass efficiency of the insulator material. An iterative, one dimensional finite element analysis was used to size the external insulation required to protect the structure at a single location on the Space Shuttle Orbiter and a reusable launch vehicle. Required insulation masses were calculated for a range of different materials for both structure and insulator. The required insulation masses calculated using the approximate equation were shown to typically agree with finite element results within 10 to 20 percent over the range of parameters studied.

As one of the most important considerations, fire-resistance design of high strength steel structures requires understanding on material behaviour of high strength structural steels in fire. Provided collapse does not occur when a steel structure is exposed to fire, it needs reliable evaluation after fire to decide whether the steel structure can be reused or not. Reliable evaluation requires accurate material behaviour of steels after fire. However in literature reports on material behaviour of high strength structural steels under fire condition are very few, and the condition is much worse for reports on material behaviour of high strength structural steels after fire. In order to reveal more information on material behaviour of high strength structural steel S460 both in fire and after fire, an experimental research has been carried out. The elastic modulus, yield strength and ultimate strength of S460 in fire and after fire were presented herein. The comparison with current European, American, British and Australian design standards of steel structures showed that the material behaviour of high strength steel S460 in fire was different from mild steels and the current leading design standards were not applicable to high strength steel S460. This paper highlights the necessity of employing unique elevated-temperature and post-fire material behaviour of high strength steel S460 to conduct safe fire-resistance design and evaluation after fire on steel structures with S460. Moreover, the residual material behaviour of high strength steel S460 after fire was found promising for its reuse. © ICASS 2012.

The primary goal of the sustainable building structure we proposed is longevity, namely extending the service life of the entire structure. The secondary goal is realizing a sustainable building structure that permits reusing structural members if the primary goal cannot be attained due to changing social needs. This structure is one form of a damage-controlled structure. Clearly separating the main frame from seismic energy absorption members keeps the main frame within the elastic range, and the seismic energy absorption members can collectively absorb the seismic energy force. Even when exposed to large earthquakes, the beam-to-column connection, being equipped with rotation capacity, enables buckling-restrained braces designed to function as seismic-response controlled members to absorb the seismic force. Thus, the continued use of the main frame is possible by replacing only earthquake-damaged braces where necessary; reusing structural members is also possible. In this paper, aiming at the practical use of the sustainable building structure, the authors discuss design, construction, dismantling of the sustainable building structure. Next, the authors verify that this structure is appropriate for reusing structural members through trial construction and dismantling.","Connection bolt; Reuse; Sustainability; Sustainable building structure; Trial construction; Trial dismantling","Buildings; Construction; Earthquakes; Energy absorption; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Seismic response; Seismology; Structural members; Beam-to-column connections; Buckling restrained braces; Building steel structure; Controlled structures; Environmental burdens; Reuse; Sustainable building; Trial dismantling; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,Scopus

Thorough investigation is needed for buildings located in those regions, to be incorporated with base isolator and then dynamic analysis to carry over. This research provides incorporation of Lead Rubber Bearing and High Damping Rubber Bearing as base isolators in addition to focussing on the changes of structural parameters for isolating effects in those vicinities. Nonlinear models of Lead Rubber Bearing and High Damping Rubber Bearing have been built up. The design of base isolators for building construction is covered along with structural feasibility. Linear static, free vibration and nonlinear dynamic time domain analyses are performed for both isolated and non-isolated buildings under site specific bi-directional earthquake. The automated Newmark-beta time integration approach has been adopted for solution in time domain. The nonlinearities, arising due to base isolated bearings and seismic forces are duly considered. The study reveals that for medium rise building construction, isolation can significantly reduce seismic response in soft to medium stiff soil. The reduction of overturning base moment due to isolation indicates that the building becomes more stable compared to the fixed base structure. Modelled non-linear bearings have been found to be suitable to cope with the precise nonlinearities. The building experiences more flexibility even when using the same structural element configuration. In addition, the flexibility of the structure envisages some sort of savings due to reduced structural responses through incorporation of the isolator. In seismic vulnerable areas where the main concern is the mitigation of the seismic instability with the support of critical components, the study shows the effectiveness of the base isolation system in terms of lessening structural responses under seismic loading. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Unlike other systems the contractor has little choice than to use overhead or under-slung gantries when erecting such viaducts, unless it is possible to utilize ground-supported false work. Decks are activated span by span by stressing all segments of a span together with longitudinal prestressing cables, which run the full span length. Because such gantries need to be able to support the weight of an entire span, they are among the heaviest erection equipment used for bridge construction. The method by which segments are joined and activated to self-supporting spans has a direct impact on gantry's performance criteria and configuration. The designer should understand the detail of how such bridges are built, as many design and detailing aspects are governed by construction considerations and not by in-service requirements.

The uniquely developed structural system embodying this concept is defined in this paper as a DC structure. Even when exposed to large earthquakes, the beam-to-column connections of the DC structure, being equipped with rotation capacity, allow seismic force to be absorbed by buckling-restrained knee braces designed to function as seismic-response- controlled members. Thus, the main frame can continue to be used by replacing only earthquake-damaged knee braces where necessary and th e structural members can also be reused. In this paper, we discuss the designing process of the DC structure. First, the design flow is presented, as well as meth ods for designing the beam-to-column connection and buckling-restrained knee braces developed based on the results of previous tests. Next, a trial design of the DC structure is implemented based on the proposed designing methods.","Beam-to-column connection; Bucklingrestrained knee brace; Damage-controlled structure; Reuse; Trial design","Basic concepts; Beam-to-column connections; Bucklingrestrained knee brace; Design flows; Designing methods; Designing process; Elastic ranges; Main-frames; Reuse; Rotation capacity; Seismic energy; Seismic forces; Structural systems; Design; Earthquakes; Buckling",Article,Scopus

The type(s) of linkers used for the immobilization of the capture probes and the exact immobilization protocol play a vital role in the overall performance of sensors. A variety of linker molecules have been used to biofunctionalize technologically important substrates (glass, gold, mica etc.). Amongst the different linkers, researchers have paid more attention to two dimensional architectures, e.g. silanes, polyaniline (PANI), alkanethiols, poly-l-lysine (PLL), etc. Despite extensive research and a large number of reports, researchers still face problems related to limited loading efficiency, limited accessibility of the probes, poor control over uniform spacing among the probes and a loss of functionality due to irregular orientation of the probes, all of which cause variability in the responses. Three dimensional gel based matrices have proved to be a better choice, except for the fact that the leaching of entrapped probe molecules has limited their use in developing sensor platforms. Taking into account the limitations of the two dimensional linker arrays and three dimensional gel matrices, supramolecular dendritic architectures have shown immense potential in designing and developing the sensor platforms. Dendrimers are well-defined, monodispersed, globular macromolecules constructed around a core unit. Different properties of dendrimers, i.e. their structural uniformity, globular shape, monodispersity, the existence of dendritic crevices, high functional group density, hydrophilicity, versatility to design dendrimer of different composition and their nanometric size can be exploited while developing high sensitivity biosensors. Researchers have demonstrated that these hyperbranched 3D molecules show enhanced sensitivity, reduced nonspecific binding, greater accessibility of the probe for the target analyte, high stability and low variability in their response. Hence, designing a sensor with a dendrimer as a linker is a successful approach to obtain superior sensor performance and minimize the overall cost of a sensor. In this article, we discuss various aspects of dendrimers from the point of view of sensor design, hoping that this review will excite more researchers into exploiting the exceptional properties of dendrimers in biosensor development. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Amino acids; Biomaterials; Chemical stability; Dendrimers; Functional groups; Functional polymers; Gels; Leaching; Mica; Molecules; Polyaniline; Probes; Research; Reusability; Sensors; Three dimensional; Two dimensional; Alkanethiols; Analytes; Biofunctionalization; Dendritic architectures; Dimensional architectures; Enhanced sensitivity; High sensitivity; High stability; Hyperbranched; Linker molecules; Loading efficiency; Mono-dispersed; Monodispersity; Nanometric size; Non-specific binding; Overall costs; Poly-L-lysine; Probe molecules; Reproducibilities; Sensor designs; Sensor performance; Sensor platform; Structural uniformity; Biosensors",Article,Scopus

The composites industry is now producing a wide range of FRP products that include strengthening strips and sheets, reinforcing bars, structural profiles, sandwich panels, moulded planks and piping. The waste management of FRP materials, in particular those made with thermosetting resins, is a critical issue for the composites industry because these materials cannot be reprocessed. Therefore, most thermosetting FRP waste is presently sent to landfill, in spite of the significant environmental impact caused by disposing of it in this way. Because more and more waste is being produced throughout the life cycle of FRPs, innovative solutions are needed to manage it. This paper first presents a state-of-the-art review of the present alternatives available to manage FRP waste. It then describes an experimental study conducted on the technical feasibility of incorporating the fine waste generated during the manufacturing of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites in concrete mixtures. Tests were carried out to evaluate the fresh-state and hardened-state properties of concrete mixes in which between 0% and 20% of sand was replaced by GFRP fine waste. Although the incorporation of high proportions of GFRP waste was found to worsen concrete performance in terms of both mechanical and durability-related properties, it seems feasible to incorporate low proportions and reuse GFRP fine waste in concrete, particularly in non-structural applications such as architectural concrete or pavement slabs, where good mechanical properties are less important. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is based on the exposure of water, contained in PET bottles, to direct sunlight, and mainly its UV-A and infrared components. The present research studied SODIS as a low cost alternative for the inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) in treated greywater, aiming at its reuse for more noble applications. Experiments were performed in (i) batch mode (2 L PET-bottles), testing the effect of turbidity on system efficiency and, (ii) in a continuous pilot-scale reactor prototype (51 L, using interconnected 2 L-PET bottles), testing hydraulic retention times (HRT) of 18 and 24 h. Samples were exposed to an average solar radiation intensity of 518 W/m 2. The results obtained indicate that the SODIS system has potential for total coliforms and E. coli inactivation in the pre-treated greywater, reaching 2.1 log units E. coli inactivation in batch experiments for low turbidity samples (21 NTU), and &gt;2 log units inactivation of total coliforms (and E. coli, when present) for the 24 h HRT-continuous prototype.

The aspect of reusability is firstly discussed for the space shuttle main engine, the only rocket engine in the world that has demonstrated multiple reuses. Initial projections are contrasted against final reusability achievements summarizing three decades of operating the space shuttle main engine. The discussion is then extended to engines employed on expendable launch vehicles with an operational life requirement typically specifying structural integrities up to 20 cycles (start-ups) and an accumulated burning time of about 6,000 s (Vulcain engine family). Today, this life potential substantially exceeds the duty cycle of an expendable engine. It is actually exploited only during the development and qualification phase of an engine when system reliability is demonstrated on ground test facilities with a reduced number of hardware sets that are subjected to an extended number of test cycles and operation time. The paper will finally evaluate the logic and effort necessary to qualify a reusable engine for a required reliability and put this result in context of possible cost savings realized from reuse operations over a time span of 25 years. © 2011 CEAS.","Development cost; Reliability; Reuseability; Rocket propulsion","Burning time; Cost saving; Development costs; Duty cycles; Expendable launch vehicles; Ground test facilities; Operation time; Operational life; Reuseability; Rocket propulsion; Rocket propulsion systems; Space launch vehicles; Space shuttle main engines; Space transportations; Start-ups; Status and outlook; System reliability; Test cycles; Time span; Transportation system; Launch vehicles; Propulsion; Reliability; Rocket engines; Reusability",Article,Scopus

Structural analyses by means of XRD and nitrogen adsorption confirmed that the P- and/or Ca-modified MCM-41 materials retained their structural quality even after the modification or the enzyme immobilization. Detailed studies of the adsorption behaviors and characterization using FT-IR spectroscopy and zeta potential measurements revealed that the P and Ca atoms attached on the silica surface provided increased uptake of HRP molecules, which is attributable to the more negatively charged surface or strong interatomic interactions between these atoms and the functional groups of the enzyme. In particular, P-modified MCM-41 showed an improved adsorption capacity in a short adsorption period and over a wide pH range without denaturation of the protein structure, in which the largest HRP adsorption capacity was 154 mg/g. Furthermore, HRP immobilized on P-modified MCM-41 showed higher enzymatic activity and reusability in the oxidation of 1,2-diaminobenzene in an organic solvent at a temperature of 37 °C than that immobilized on the parent MCM-41. This enhancement in enzymatic activity can be related to the structural integrity of loaded HRP molecules and the strong adsorption on the P-MCM-41 surface.

Chitin isolated from crab shells was used as a biosorbent for removal of three EDCs-benzo(a)antracene, β-estradiol and bisphenol A-present in contaminated groundwater. Fourier transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, porosimetry and scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used for structural elucidation of chitin. Experiments were conducted using batch adsorption mode under different conditions of initial EDCs concentration, solution pH and adsorbent dose. The effect of chitin particle size was also investigated. Batch adsorption data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and pseudo-first- and second-order models for kinetic study. RESULTS: The maximum adsorption capacity of chitin by the three EDCs, calculated using the Langmuir equation, ranged from 42.9 to 84 mg g-1. The adsorption of EDCs by chitin was due primarily to electrostatic forces. The measurement of zeta potential indicated that chitin has higher surface charge in alkaline pH, resulting in reduction in removal of EDCs with increasing pH. Complementary to the experimental results molecular simulations were also performed on HyperChem software to understand the adsorption mechanism between chitin and EDCs in aquesous solutions. Chitin was regenerated after washing with methanol/acetic acid (1/3, v/v) and the regeneration process was repeated for 10 cycles, which showed 90% adsorption capacity retained by chitin. CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results suggest that chitin could be employed as an adsorbent in the removal of EDCs from aqueous solutions, and the adsorption potential of used chitin can be recovered by methanol/acetic acid solvent washings. The reusable biosorbent chitin would be cost-effective and a better option for future water remediation endeavours. © 2010 Society of Chemical Industry.","Adsorption; Chitin; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Reusability; Water purification","Acid solvents; Adsorbent dose; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption mechanism; Adsorption potential; Alkaline pH; Antracene; Aqueous solutions; Batch adsorption; Biosorbents; Bisphenol A; Contaminated groundwater; Crab shells; Drinking water; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; FTIR; Infra red; Kinetic study; Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms; Langmuir equation; Molecular simulations; Porosimetry; Regeneration process; Scanning electron microscopes; Second-order models; Solution pH; Structural elucidation; Water purification; Water remediation; Chitin; Dyes; Fourier transforms; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Industrial chemicals; Phenols; Potable water; Purification; Remediation; Reusability; Scanning electron microscopy; Washing; Water supply; Water treatment plants; Zeta potential; Adsorption; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; acetic acid; benz[a]anthracene; chitin; endocrine disruptor; estradiol; ground water; methanol; adsorption kinetics; alkalinity; aqueous solution; article; chemical structure; computer program; infrared spectroscopy; isotherm; particle size; pH; porosity; scanning electron microscopy; static electricity; surface charge; waste component removal; waste water management; water contamination; zeta potential; Decapoda (Crustacea)",Article,Scopus

Development of such construction materials with lower thermal transmittance reusing these wastes is a challenging issue since it provides a combined solution for today's energy saving and environmental pollution concerns. In favor of this, recent European Union directives have brought quiet strict limits to reduce energy consumption and landfill disposal of solid wastes. A model room whose exteriors are fully made with scrap-tire added concrete is built here to increase its thermal protection. A standard/conventional room at identical dimensions but surrounded by ordinary concretes is also built to examine influence of scrap tire addition on room's thermal protection. Long-term thermal behaviors of these two rooms are investigated and compared under real atmospheric environments. Their indoor temperatures reveal that addition of scrap tire pieces lowers both indoor temperature variations and the effect of outdoor conditions. As an example, mean values of yearly thermal time lag are found to be 3.28 and 2.96 h, respectively for the rooms built with and without using scrap tire pieces, corresponding to nearly 11% improvement in thermal protection. Results in overall verify that scrap tire addition improves thermal protection of the room and it is a cost effective solution for people with low income and/or individuals living in rural areas. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

More significantly, used wood can be reused as the raw material of PLSL, then the crude wood will be conserved and the cost will be lowered. To study its mechanical properties, the commercial software ANSYS is adopted to establish the finite element models of PLSL. The diameter and spacing of prestressed steel wire, the magnitude of the prestress and the width of the lumber are some factors considered. Based on the nonlinear finite element buckling analysis of these lumbers, some major conclusions are summarized as follows: (1) The improvement of strength is comparatively obvious to use PLSL compared with the traditional plywood products; (2) The ultimate bearing load is rising along with the increase of the diameter of the prestressed steel wire and the width of the lumber; (3) The ultimate bearing load is descending with the increase of the spacing of the prestressed steel wire; (4) The ultimate bearing load is rising along with the increase of the magnitude of the prestress at first, but when the prestress reaches a certain level, the ultimate bearing load starts to descend.","Multiple integration; Nonlinear buckling analysis; Prestress; Recycling of used wood; Ultimate bearing load","Bearing loads; Commercial software; Finite element models; Laminated strand lumber; Load carrying capacities; Multiple integration; Multiple integration method; Non-linear finite elements; Nonlinear buckling analysis; Pre-stress; Pre-stressed; Pre-stressed steel; Shear capacity; Wood resources; Bearings (structural); Buckling; Building materials; Construction equipment; Finite element method; Laminating; Lumber; Mechanical properties; Metal analysis; Nonlinear analysis; Recycling; Wire products; Wood; Plywood; Bearings; Buckling; Lamination; Lumber; Mechanical Properties; Ply Wood; Raw Materials; Recycling; Reinforced Concrete; Shear Stress; Wire Products",Conference Paper,Scopus

This study proposes a system for membrane based water, solids and air treatment functions that is embedded into the walls of inflatable habitat structures to provide potentially radical mass reuse and structural advantages over current mechanical life support hardware operating within rigid habitat envelopes. This approach would allow part of the water and air treatment, and all of the solids residuals treatment and recycle, to be removed from the usable habitat volume while providing a mechanism to recover and reuse water treatment residuals (solids) to strengthen the habitat shell, provide thermal control, and radiation shielding. The same embedded membrane treatment elements would first for a time provide primary (1st stage) wastewater treatment, then provide solids accumulation and stabilization, and finally become a permanent structural element for the mature habitat shell. Secondary air treatment membrane elements similarly located are also briefly considered as potential future additions to the treatment architecture. The technology used is not speculative but is based on established emergency water recovery technology being used in the Light Weight Contingency - Water Recovery Apparatus (LWC-WRS), Direct Osmotic Concentration (DOC) but in a scaled up version. As such all hardware proposed is based on commercial off the shelf products and materials, and the 1st stage water treatment is well demonstrated and documentation indicates better than 90% water recovery as a first stage treatment for hygiene water and urine. Thus, the proposed technology is based upon proven engineering solutions that will be analytically demonstrated to potently serve a much larger role in future space architecture.

This guidance essentially shapes the trajectory of the RLV by predicting the necessary angle of attack and bank angle that the vehicle should execute. The path constraints (imposed as 'soft constraints') are in the form of structural load and thermal load constraint as well as bounds on angle of attack and bank angle. The terminal constraints (imposed as 'hard constraints'), on the other hand, are are in the form of three-dimensional position and velocity vector components at the end of the reentry. Whereas the angle of attack solution comes out of the MPSP guidance directly, the bank angle command generation is done in two steps. First, the required heading angle is considered as an intermediate control variable to steer the vehicle towards the desired final coordinates. Next, the required bank angle is computed through a dynamic inversion loop considering the heading angle dynamics. Such a two-loop synthesis leads to smoothness as well as reversals in the bank angle at appropriate points in the trajectory within the specified bounds. The computationally efficient MPSP guidance law is primarily based on nonlinear optimal control theory and hence embeds effective trajectory optimization concepts into the guidance law. In addition to the promising results for the nominal case, it has also been demonstrated that the proposed guidance has sufficient robustness for perturbations in the states, which may possibly arise from noise input.

Since AFRL(Air Force Research Laboratory)'s first attempt in 1993, non-explosive release devices are widely used in space industry in deploying instrument like solar array, balloon or in separation of small satellites from launch vehicle. Most important function of them is to release the instrument safely with low-shock so that the instrument and spacecraft are not damaged during separation process. In addition to this, several features: short separation time, structural integrity with a high preload and reusability are often required. To develop such actuator, SMA(Shape Memory Alloys) having shape-memory effect(one-way memory effect and two-way memory effect) is widely used as the trigger or the load-bearing mechanism. However, in the case of SMA wire, usually, it works as the trigger with well-known one-way memory effect in commercial SMA actuator. Before re-using it, additional pre-straining process should be performed to make deformation up to a certain level using universal testing machine. Additionally, some of the used small parts including spools, plungers should be replaced. In the low shock release device with two-way memory effect, the trigger mechanism is extremely simple because SMA remembers two different shapes: one at the low temperature and the other at the high temperature shape. It does not need any pre-straining process as well as preserve major key requirement: low-shock, short separation time, and reusability.

So, the space vehicle's thermal protection system (TPS) is one of the most expensive and critical systems of the vehicle. The goal of the present study is to develop an advanced structural solutions for the ""hot structures"" which should operate in aero-thermodynamic environment of typical re-entry conditions for reusable launch vehicle. The purpose of this work is to present a new technology developed for the production of Carbon Carbon (C/C) materials for TPS applications. In effect the C/C based on the impregnation and/or infiltration process have proven suitability under extreme thermo-mechanical environments in different structural parts like nose caps, nozzle jet vanes and engine flaps. In the last years considerable progress has been achieved to improve the manufacturing technologies of this materials, with very high costs. The C/C has good characteristics, particularly adapted to operate in these environments with high resistance, high elongation modulus, high mechanical property at high temperature and very low CTE. The key factor for using this kind of material is the high stability at high temperature, preserving its mechanical properties. Actually the production is provided by a densification process inside oven with inert gas, during the curing process. The goal is to obtain an innovative sandwich structure with C/C skin produced from a new process using new source material. The innovative process used for the skin is obtained optimizing the pyrolysis cycles controlling both temperature and pressure. The combined action of temperature and pressure provides a good densification level for the resulting materials with better mechanical properties. The source matrix material is modified using SiC nanoparticles, directly added to the phenolic matrix by means of ultrasonication route, in order to improve the densification process as well as the thermo-mechanical properties of the final C/C composite. In order to validate the material, thermo-mechanical tests will be performed in accord to ASTM standard.

Through proper handlings, self-repairing (crack close-up) of concrete cracks is possible in the concrete hydration damaged region. Due to the effect of heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent crystal growth of calcium hydroxide, a better bonding strength forms interlocking the new and old concrete interfaces. A proposal on the relationship between the self-repairing, regeneration function of concrete and the rehabilitation of historic buildings is suggested, this is based on the formed process of the bonding strength of the interfaces and the function on concrete repairing. Besides the constitution and features of the microstructure of concrete, the relationship between the micro-structure and the macro-mechanical property is also investigated in this paper. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Concrete; Micro-structure; Recycle; Reduce; Regeneration; Rehabilitation; Reuse","Recycle; Reduce; Regeneration; Rehabilitation; Reuse; Building materials; Buildings; Cracks; Crystal growth; Diffusion bonding; Hydrated lime; Recycling; Repair; Retrofitting; Structural analysis; Mechanical properties",Conference Paper,Scopus

The ARMOR TPS is one of important candidate structure of RLV. ARMOR TPS has many advantages, for example: fixing easily, longer life, good properties, short time of maintenance and service. In comparison with traditional TPS, the ARMOR TPS will be the best selection for all kinds of RLV. So the ARMOR thermal protection system will be used in aviation and spaceflight field more and more widely because of its much better performance. ARMOR TPS panel is above the whole ARMOR TPS, and the metal honeycomb sandwich structure is the surface of the ARMOR TPS panel. So the metal honeycomb sandwich structure plays an important role in the ARMOR TPS, while it bears the flight dynamic pressure and stands against the flight dynamic calefaction. Because the active environment of metal honeycomb sandwich structure is very formidable, it can produce interface connection defects which can exist in the process of manufacture as well. Tensile mechanical properties of the metallic honeycomb sandwich structure with defects are analyzed to obtain damage tolerance of the structure. The effect of shape, dimension and location of defects on the tensile mechanical properties is conducted by experimental study.

The proposed development process is divided into four stages: functional analysis, static structural analysis, behavior analysis and verification, and system implementation. The Integration Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0), Object-Oriented Petri Net (OPN), and Unified Modeling Language (UML) are integrated into the corresponding stages based on their characteristics. In order to develop the system rapidly and efficiently, the transformation rules between the IDEF0 and OPN, and between the OPN and sequence diagram are conducted. In addition, the attributes and operations for each object are also defined directly from the OPN model.

As-spun yarnswere subjected to drawing and draw-texturing processes. Fiber structure and physical properties of yarn samples were measured and evaluated. Results showed that viscosity and molecular weight of samples with recycled PA6 displayed higher loss compared to the new PA6 fibers after melt spinning. Birefringence of recycled PA6 as-spun yarns was lower than that of new PA6. This difference was compensated by the drawing.

Gaertn (kapok) is a natural sorbent that exhibits excellent hydrophobic-oleophilic characteristics. The effect of packing density, the oil types and solvent treatment on the sorption characteristics of kapok was studied in a batch system. Oil sorption capacity, retention capacity, entrapment stability and kapok reusability were evaluated. Based on SEM and FTIR analyses, kapok fiber was shown to be a lignocellulosic material with hydrophobic waxy coating over the hollow structures. Higher packing density at 0.08. g/ml showed lower sorption capacity, but higher percentage of dynamic oil retention, with only 1% of oil drained out from the test cell. Kapok remained stable after fifteen cycles of reuse with only 30% of sorption capacity reduction. The oil entrapment stability at 0.08. g/ml packing was high with more than 90% of diesel and used engine oil retained after horizontal shaking. After 8. h of chloroform and alkali treatment, 2.1% and 26.3% reduction in sorption capacity were observed, respectively, as compared to the raw kapok. The rigid hollow structure was reduced to flattened-like structure after alkali treatment, though no major structural difference was observed after chloroform treatment.

In this method, an integrated parametric system that fully considers the characteristics of the platform is developed, which significantly optimizes the design process with the top-bottom design concept. In the parametric system, the main geometric dimensions are taken as parameters, while the topology between the structure members, the function requirements and the safety requirements are converted into geometric constraints. By geometric constraint solving (GCS), a set of parameters that satisfy all the given constraints are determined, and then the design scheme is obtained by several core algorithms, such as parametric tank subdivision, 3D stability calculation, parametric structure design, FEM preprocessing, etc. The parametric method greatly increases the changeability and the reusability of the platform model, and concurrent design is well supported. As the model is driven by parameters, PPDM is an excellent method for optimization design. As a result, PPDM has incomparable advantages on the design efficiency over traditional methods. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The shell-core Ca(C3H7O3)2/CaCO3 solid-base catalyst was prepared with a mechanical strong core of CaCO3 for continuous transesterification of soybean oil in a packed-bed reactor. Alcohol-oil ratio, retention time and reaction temperature were evaluated to obtain optimum reaction conditions. The yield of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME, i.e. biodiesel) achieved 95% at the reaction temperature 60 °C, alcohol-oil molar ratio of 30:1 and retention time of 168 min. The reusability of catalyst was checked up to 5 cycles and found negligible decrease in the catalyst activity. Water in the oil can significantly decrease the yield due to the deactivation of Ca(C3H7O3)2 and hydrolysis of FAME. The transesterification of soybean oil, canola oil and sunflower oil also was compared with model compound, triolein, using powder Ca(C3H7O3)2 in the batch reactor.

The effects of pH, MMt dose, and dye concentration were studied. A low pH value is favorable for the decolorization of orange II. The hydroxyl radical (O H) concentration increased with increasing concentration of MMt in aqueous solutions in the range of 0-1.5 g/L. Concentrations higher than 5.0 g/L MMt inhibited the O H production. There was no significant decrease in photocatalytic activity when the catalyst was reused. Hydroxyl radicals were detected by tert-butyl alcohol in aqueous MMt suspensions under ultraviolet irradiation and were responsible for the degradation of orange II.

Nowadays, raw-earth constructions are an area of growing interest, both for rescuing the heritage and for a rediscovered environmentally friendly building and eco-sustainability material. However, because raw-earth constructions are a forgotten technique, we find problems of a lack of skilled people at all levels in this area, from designers to masons, as well as problems of how to carry out compatible conservation works on earthen heritage. This paper tries to fill the gap for a peculiar historic earthen building technology, namely cob (or bauge), which is present in Macerata in the center of Italy. Results are presented on regaining possession of the material and constructional aspects and their initial structural resources, and guidelines are given on how to improve the manufacturing process to reuse the cob technique for construction and for how to accurately work on it for a compatible and sustainable conservation. © 2010 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Bauge; Cob; Conservation; Earthen building technology; Initial mechanical properties; Raw-earth architecture; Reuse; Workmanlike",,Article,Scopus

The paper captures the basic state dependent equations needed for the dual-loop servo structure: SDRE Outer Loop Servo Serving as the Guidance Loop Function and SDRE Inner Loop Servo Serving as the Control Loop Function. Control performance allocation via six control surface deflections (i.e., 2 elevons, 2 rudders, and 2 body flaps) will be accomplished via the real-time dynamic (adaptive) gain calculation using the SDRE algorithm. The ability to adjust its G&C gain subject to loss of one control surface or a combination of multiple control surfaces is explored to achieve adaptive optimal control allocation subject to the Hamilton-Jacobi- Bellman (HJB) optimization principle. Since The SDRE design methodology employs nonlinear fully coupled dynamics equations updated in real-time via state dependent (SD) quantities supplied by vehicle's sensors and actuators measurements (i.e., RLV's health state vector) and computes its G&C actions based on HJB principle, thus its solution is at least suboptimal in this respect. As a result, it is expected to outperform most of other state of the art design principles (e.g., dynamic inversion, SDRE, gain scheduling, etc). The paper examines the RLV's G&C design using the SDRE dual loop structure to accommodate four different flight conditions during which two control surfaces per flight condition become disabled. The proposed SDRE based control laws, via simulation, have demonstrated its attractive features in maintaining rate stabilization while the baseline traditional control law like Dynamic Inversion (DI) based technique fails to stabilize the RLV.

Determining the residual strength can provide useful information for structural design and reuse of the decommissioned treated wood. This study evaluated the residual strength of decommissioned chromated copper arsenate-treated utility pole wood. Eleven decommissioned southern pine (Pinus spp.) distribution poles and pole sections were evaluated, using small clear samples, for bending strength and stiffness across and along each pole. Results showed that the strength of the decommissioned treated wood varied across and along each pole and among the poles. Average modulus of rupture (MOR) was 80.9 percent of the typical MOR of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) virgin wood, and average modulus of elasticity (MOE) was 83.9 percent of the typical MOE. Average MOR of the samples in the outer surface (first test zone) was 7.5 percent lower than the average MOR of the adjacent samples toward the pith (second test zone) on each side of the pole surfaces, but average MOE showed no significant difference between the two zones. Older poles lost more strength in the first test zone.

This means that such structures must tolerate the high temperatures engendered by aero-thermal reentry fluxes due to the establishment of a hypersonic regime over the body. Thermal Protection Systems (TPS) are used to maintain a reusable launch vehicle's structural temperature within acceptable limits during re-entry flights; that is, internal temperature should not overcome the temperature limit use of the internal structure. TPS are usually composed by several layers made of different materials. Heat transfer through a multilayer insulation during atmospheric re-entry involves combined modes of heat transfer: heat conduction through the solid, heat radiation to the outer space etc. In the frame of TPS design activities a procedure based on one dimensional analytical solutions of transient nonlinear analyses has been developed in order to estimate the temperature variation with time and space of a multilayered body subjected to aerodynamic heating inside a radiating space. Since internal temperature values of TPSs of re-entry vehicles cannot exceed certain values, that procedure allows to quickly evaluate those temperature values and to preliminary size layer thicknesses before preparing and performing Finite Element analyses.

Equivalence information ensures the consistency and traceability of product information throughout the product lifecycle. The sales-delivery process of engineer-to-order (ETO) products presents a great potential for design reuse, i.e. the reuse of previously validated design solutions in the design of new product variants according to customer-specific requirements. A product family data model that focuses on the interdependencies of viewpoints on information will therefore improve the setup of design reuse mechanisms such as modularity. This paper describes the Adaptive Generic Product Structure (AGPS), a dynamic structure-based product family modelling approach that enables the systematic aggregation of product variants and their distinctive components.

The importance of changing traditionally adopted attitudes (such as the discard of used materials components for recycling and reuse practices) in order to create a more sustainable production model is presented in the literature. The aim of this exploratory paper is to analyze major social, economical and legal factors, which can act as barriers or opportunities in the reuse of building components. The research strategy employed is a single-embedded case study. The main unit of analysis is the reuse process, investigated by the study of the demolition sector in the city of Porto Alegre (Brazil). The process is characterized; its main phases and agents are presented and described. The supply chain management (SCM) approach is used to model the reuse process. The article summarizes major factors, which influence the reuse process, pointed in the literature and compares those with the case study findings enabling the identification of some differences. The case study findings suggest that the reuse of building components is primarily supported by economical and social aspects such as the labor cost of deconstruction and demand for reused products. Although legal mechanisms may play an important role in promoting the reuse of building components, its potential was not observed in the case study. The article also provides a critical analysis of the current state of construction waste management in Porto Alegre on issues like legislation and responsibilities, considering recent changes in national regulations. Finally, the adoption of the SCM approach has showed to be useful for the analysis of ""close loop"" supply chains as it enabled the identification of additional factors that can influence the reuse process. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Parallel kinematic robots feature a wide variety of structures and applications. They are subject to easy reconfiguration because of the passive structure limbs. This class of robots requires more extensive calculations in their control laws than serial manipulators. During complex motion tasks, such as the ones required in assembly sequences, the algorithmic load may also vary over time. However, no generic control approach exists in order to reduce the complexity of control design for these kind of robots. In this paper the authors introduce an architecture for handling and assembly applications featuring self-management techniques as an approach to tackle these problems. The existing architecture features a modular and layered design. Concepts of self-management and self-optimization applied to this architecture are outlined. These properties are realized by the integration of self-managers within crucial system components. The mechanisms are extended for a future distributed version of the architecture.

This paper discusses the use of climate data collection software, heat loss and heat gain considerations and software; how to achieve a zero energy building and qualifying as a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certified Platinum home. Site selection is the first step. This first step can be taken after you have identified your goals. What alternative energy systems do you want to use? Do you want to use more than one alternative source? What other site considerations are important? In my case, I wanted to use solar energy as my primary alternative energy source. Why? I want comfort, reliability and ease of use. Other alternatives may require more maintenance. Wind power will be a second source that will be incorporated to produce electricity when the PV system can not produce. The site selected is a south facing mountain that has a steady breeze most of the time. Another consideration for me is the ability to use earth-sheltering as a measure of high efficiency construction. The south-facing mountain also provides the opportunity to ""nestle"" into the mountainside. Calculations and basis of design are presented. Using less is a key mindset that we all need to move toward. Using less does not mean that you suffer. This house will be comfortable year round with little effort because the house uses passive solar design for lighting and space heating, active solar hot water for additional heating of the floor and domestic hot water, and PV/wind/biodiesel generator backup to generate electricity for lighting and other typical electrical loads. The construction materials provide high R-values and green products that contribute to excellent indoor air quality. SIPs (Structural Insulated Panels) will be used as the structural components for the walls and roof. All electrical appliances, refrigerator, lighting, and washer/dryer were selected to use less electricity and water. Data describing the energy requirements are provided. Reuse all that you can. I am incorporating a masonry heater, also known as a Russian Fireplace. The combustion efficiency of the masonry fireplace is typically 92-94 percent with very low emissions. The masonry fireplace will provide passive mass for passive release of the woodburning energy during the evening and heat hot water coils in the fireplace as well (as the hot water backup system). The use of hard woods from the land will provide heat overnight, heat for cooking and supply additional BTUs for domestic hot water and radiant heat. Many of the building materials that are selected for construction are from the land; stone and whole cut wood from the land will be used for esthetic appeal and thermal mass thereby reducing harmful manufacturer's emissions. My site is an excellent site for a hybrid solar and wind power (with a biodiesel generator as backup) system.

Such frameworks lack a strong decoupling between the modeling of the system's structural composition and their QoS requirements. This lack of QoS modularization limits (1) reusability of such frameworks, (2) ease of maintenance when new non-functional characteristics are added, and (3) independent evolution of the modeling frameworks along both the structural and non-functional dimensions. This paper describes Component QoS Modeling Language (CQML), which is a reusable, extensible, and aspect-oriented modeling approach that provides strong separation between the structural and non-functional dimensions. CQML supports independent evolution of structural as well as QoS metamodel of composition modeling languages. The join point model of CQML enables declarative QoS aspect modeling and supports automatic weaving of structural changes effected by QoS requirements.

The modular building stones of the freeform structures under study are sandwich panels with a foamed polyurethane core and TRC (textile reinforced concrete) faces, shaped in the form of hyperbolic paraboloids (hypars). The shape of these modular building stones allows the production of structural elements on a reusable doubly-curved mould. For the dimensioning of the global modular structure, two states are important according to the Eurocodes: the ultimate limit states and the serviceability limit states. Due to the lightweight aspect of the modular structure, the serviceability limit states will gain in importance: stiffness and crack formation become important factors, as does the influence of repeated loading.

ARMOR TPS is means adaptable, robust, metallic, operable, reusable TPS. The ARMOR TPS has many advantages, for example: fixing easily, longer life, good properties, short time of maintenance and service. The ARMOR TPS is one of important candidate structure of RLV. ARMOR thermal protection system in foreign countries for reusable launch vehicle is used instead of the traditional ceramic-matrix composite thermal protection system and C/C thermal protection system. Also the constituent feature of ARMOR thermal protection system is much better than the traditional TPS. In comparison with traditional TPS, the ARMOR TPS will be the best selection for all kinds of RLV. So the ARMOR thermal protection system will be used in aviation and spaceflight field more and more widely because of its much better performance. ARMOR TPS panel is above the whole ARMOR TPS, and the metal honeycomb sandwich structure is the surface of the ARMOR TPS panel. So the metal honeycomb sandwich structure plays an important role in the ARMOR TPS, while it bears the flight dynamic pressure and stands against the flight dynamic calefaction. The metal honeycomb sandwich structure is made using the technique of the whole braze welding. In the course of the vacuum high temperature braze welding, its surface will appear concave. The reasons which lead to the shortage are summarized and discussed. The difference of thermal expansion coefficient and pressure between the core and the panels may be the chief reasons.

These textile clusters mainly cover the cotton dyeing and printing operations. Approach: Therefore, treatability studies of chemical sludge were conducted using solidification/stabilization treatment to examine the possibility of its reuse in construction materials. The sludge was characterised for its physico-chemical parameters and heavy metals. Standard blocks of dimensions 70.6×70.6×70.6 mm were prepared, in which chemical sludge was used as a partial replacement of cement by mixing 30-70 % of sludge in cement. After the experimental curing, the blocks were evaluated for physical engineering properties such as hardening time, block density, unconfined compressive strength. The chemical properties were determined in terms of concentrations of heavy metals in the TCLP leachate. Results: The hardening time ranged between 30-45 h. The compressive strength in the sludge cement blocks ranged from 2.63-22.54 N mm-2 after 14 days of water curing and 6.48-24.89 N mm-2 after 28 days of water curing for 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 % sludge replacement in cement. The block density varied between 1361. 3408-1813.8992 Kg m-3 after 14 days and 1386.3953-1842.3446 Kg m-3 after 28 days of water curing. The concentrations of heavy metals were negligible in the TCLP leachate and thus below USEPA regulatory limits. Conclusion/Recommendations: As far as structural applications is concerned, it is fulfilling the criteria of some of the classes (C to K) as per the BIS standards of the bricks upto a strength of 25 N mm -2. The use of sludge can definitely be explored for other structural and nonstructural applications depending upon strength requirement.

The mesostructures and characteristics of the two mesoporous materials before and after adsorption of CRL were characterized by HRTEM, FESEM, SAXRD and N2 adsorption-desorption experiments. The pore sizes of the rod-like silica and the vesicle-like silicas were determined to be ca. 11 and 12 nm, respectively, larger than enough to accommodate lipase molecules (∼4 nm). The structural integrity of the rod-like silica as well as the vesicle-like silica is retained after adsorption of CRL into the mesopores. The catalytic activity, thermostability, and operational stability of the immobilized CRL were measured in phosphate buffer solution by hydrolysis of tributyrin. When the lipase immobilized in the vesicle-like silica was used as biocatalyst for hydrolysis of tributyrin in a batch process, the hydrolysis activity decreased only slightly from 74% to 60% over 10 cycles of reuse, indicating no obvious leaching out of the lipase from the round channels. The activity of vesicle-like silica immobilized CRL for catalytic hydrolysis of tributyrin is 21% and 14% higher than that of rod-like silica immobilized CRL at incubation temperature of 60 °C at 30 min and 90 min, respectively. The results demonstrate that the lipase immobilized in vesicle-like silica is superior to the rod-like silica in terms of higher activity, reusability and thermal stability. The unique curvature and the large size of the interlamellar pores of vesicle-like silica are suggested to be possible factors in achieving the higher activity and stability. Such a distinctive mesoporous geometry of the vesicle-like silica promises technological applications in protein adsorption and catalysis. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In the middle of 2004, a decommissioning program for a conversion plant, which was constructed in 1982, and treated about 300 tons of natural uranium until it was shut down in 1992, obtained its approval from the regulatory body. Actual dismantling and decontaminating activities have been performed since July 2004 and will be finished by December 2009. The decommissioning works were mainly divided into two parts: the inside of the building containing the process equipments; the lagoon sludge generated during the plant operation. The decommissioning of the inside of the building was carried out by dismantling the process equipment, which were firstly segmented and decontaminated by polishing and washing with steam and chemicals or melting, and then decontamination for the surfaces inside the building by excavating or grinding the concrete walls. The decontamination goals were below 0.2Bq/g for the metallic segments and below 0.4Bq/cm2 for the concrete walls. Decontamination methods were selected according to the degree of contamination and a minimization of the low level radioactive wastes was conducted throughout the decommissioning work. The lagoon sludge waste had two types, one was an various inorganic nitrate salt mixture containing a very low concentration of uranium, about 200~300ppm, in Lagoon-II and the other was an inorganic nitrate salt mixture containing a few percent of uranium in Lagoon-I. To treat these sludge wastes a thermal decomposition facility was constructed and operated to produce stable sludge wastes containing uranium oxides which are stable in the air. The final sludge wastes after a thermal treating for the sludge waste of Lagoon-I could be reused. The final residual radioactivity for the inside of the building will be measured to confirm a complete decontamination of the uranium to back ground level and then the building will be considered for another use. © 2009 by ASME.",,"Buildings; Chemical warfare; Concretes; Decommissioning (nuclear reactors); Decomposition; Decontamination; Environmental management; Lakes; Mixtures; Nitrates; Plant shutdowns; Radioactive waste disposal; Salt deposits; Uranium; Walls (structural partitions); Waste management; Decommissioning project; Environmental conditions; Long-term disposal; Low concentrations; Low-level radioactive wastes; Process equipments; Residual radioactivities; Uranium conversion; Radioactive wastes",Conference Paper,Scopus

The goal of these trade studies was to optimize configuration layouts and figures of merit (FOMs) for the Ascent Module (AM), Descent Module (DM), structural concept, and the integrated vehicle. Multiple AM concepts were developed. Four alternate lander DM configuration concepts were developed, each having different basic structural concepts and propellant tank configurations. These trade studies, presented at the AIAA Space 2008 conference, produced a wealth of useful design data and provided significant support to NASA's Altair lunar lander concept definition effort. They also pointed out the desirability of performing additional design optimization to enhance the ability of lander DM structure and systems to be scavenged on the lunar surface and reused by future crews, as potential sources of spare parts and hardware for construction of lunar outposts. Reusability of lander DM structure and systems has significant potential to reduce the amount of mass that must be transported from earth for this purpose. Additional work was performed during 2009 to optimize two of the alternate Altair DM configurations that have potential for reuse of a significant portion of structure and systems: The DM with a single LH2 tank and four LO 2 tanks, the DM with single LH2 and LO2 tanks separated by a common bulkhead. A third DM design, having single, concentric toroidal LH2 and LO2 tanks, was identified as having the potential for significant parts reuse due to its geometry and placement of subsystems. The purpose of this paper is to present these three lander designs, with design assumptions, requirements, and configuration drawings, and compare their relative Figures of Merit (FOMs) for reusability of DM structure and systems with the Boeing Reference Space Truss configuration.

Used fibers were left in 4% formaldehyde solution for 14 hours and then in 5% sodium hypochloride (bleach) solution for 6 hours in order to disinfect the membrane for the reuse idea. Tensile tests performed on both virgin and used-processed fibers reveal that toughness and ductility of the used-processed fibers are lower than the virgin ones. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies performed on virgin and used-processed fiber visualized the morphological changes. Rough surface with defects and cracks was seen in used-processed fiber, whereas a smoother surface morphology was seen in virgin fibers. Alterations in pore morphology and the size of the pores became greater in used processed fibers. Cracks, merging of pores and also more defects were visualized in used-processed fibers. Thus, easy crack initiations and easy propagations were expected in used-processed fibers which were also confirmed by tensile test experiments. In addition to these mechanical and surface studies experiments, X-ray diffractometry studies also revealed the changes in the structure of the used-processed fibers. New or growth of the existing phases and orientations were observed in usedprocessed fibers.

The RTCASS Toolbox translates CASS Abbreviated Test Language for All Systems (ATLAS) to a format compatible with the RTCASS runtime. The L200 Auto-Converter uses Teradyne's TPS Converter Studio™ to translate CASS Digital Test Language and CASS Digital Automatic Test Program Generation (DATPG) associated files (patterns, timing sets, levels, pinmaps, etc) to C source code for use with the Teradyne M9-Series Digital Test Instrument (DTI). The process for CASS to RTCASS migration requires Virtual Address eXtension (VAX) Digital Command Language (DCL) scripting files to compile ATLAS and L-Series files and transfer data from VAX or ALPHA to the PC platform. Transferred data is expected to be stored in a pre-defined directory structure, to be translated later on. The translators complete the process by displaying any errors that must be corrected and warning of potential problems. Processes associated with error corrections and methods to create CASS Fleet Deliverable Disks (also known as Blue Disks) led the In-Service Support Center (ISSC) Jacksonville, FL to create an additional set of tools that automate PC scripting and generation of VAX DCL command files. The ISSC Jacksonville tool set eliminates the manual processes that are costly, time consuming, and increase the probability of error if not done properly. The most common problems include Test Program Sets (TPS) with corrupted .dat files used for the Master Test Program Set Index (MTPSI), corrupted VAX backup save set files and corrupted or missing CASS L-Series stimulus and response pattern files. This paper demonstrates how the ISSC Jacksonville tool set provides solutions to the challenges faced in the CASS to RTCASS translation process. The tools were created for four reasons: 1) speed data transfer rate, 2) minimize user interaction, 3) increase reusability and portability of eXtensive Markup Language (XML) configuration files and 4) automate generation of PC and VAX DCL scripts. ©2008 IEEE.","Automation tools; CASS to RTCASS migration; CASS to RTCASS Test Program Sets (TPS) modification process; Operational Test Program Sets (OTPS) XML configuration; TPS re-host; VAX/VMS DCL","Automation; Data transfer; Data transfer rates; Disks (machine components); Disks (structural components); Error correction; Heat shielding; Hypertext systems; Light weight rolling stock; Linguistics; Markup languages; Microstrip devices; Military operations; Reusability; Test facilities; Testing; Translation (languages); XML; Automation tools; CASS to RTCASS migration; CASS to RTCASS Test Program Sets (TPS) modification process; Operational Test Program Sets (OTPS) XML configuration; TPS re-host; VAX/VMS DCL; Automatic programming",Conference Paper,Scopus

For that reason, discrete-event simulation is useful for modelling the behaviour of production systems, and understanding the combined effects of those factors. This paper describes two case studies carried out in different countries on the use of discrete-event simulation models in the decision making process concerned with production system design and operations of house-building projects. In the first study, carried out in Colombia, an operations analysis of the construction of structural walls and slabs in a multiple six-floor residential building project was undertaken. Based on the simulation model, a number of recommendations for reducing the total construction time were made, enabling the production managers of the construction company to assess different scenarios, and establish an improved construction sequence in order to reduce the share on non value-adding activities. The second case study consisted of the development of a reusable simulation model for the production system design of a Brazilian construction company that constructs low-rise house building projects. This model supported the development of a new production system design for the company, in order to change from standardized to customized production of dwellings, using a mass customization strategy. The paper emphasizes the challenges of using such models in a real environment, discussing the benefits that were achieved and the difficulties faced by those companies in adopting discrete-event simulation in their decision making processes.","Construction process simulation; Operations design; Production systems design","Colombia; Combined effect; Construction companies; Construction process; Construction sequence; Construction time; Decision makers; Decision making process; Discrete events; Discrete-event simulation model; House building; Mass customization; New production; Operations analysis; Operations design; Production manager; Production system; Production system designs; Production systems design; Real environments; Residential building; Reusable simulation; Simulation model; Structural walls; Buildings; Computer simulation; Construction; Construction industry; Decision making; Production engineering; Systems analysis",Conference Paper,Scopus

Parallel kinematic robots feature a wide variety of structures and applications. They are subject to easy reconfiguration because of the passive structure limbs. This class of robots requires more extensive calculations in their control laws than serial manipulators. During complex motion tasks, such as the ones required in assembly sequences, the algorithmic load may also vary over time. However, no generic control approach exists in order to reduce the complexity of control design for these kind of robots. In this paper the authors introduce an architecture for handling and assembly applications featuring self-management techniques as an approach to tackle these problems. The existing architecture features a modular and layered design. Concepts of self-management and self-optimization applied to this architecture are outlined. These properties are realized by the integration of self-managers within crucial system components. The mechanisms are extended for a future distributed version of the architecture. Real-time properties are guaranteed by an online formal analysis that verifies planned adaptations before realizing them.

The Cultural Centre was constructed in 1978 with a partial basement and extensions undertaken beneath its footprint in 1984 and 1993. Due to the unavailability of the original geotechnical report a new geotechnical investigation was undertaken from which capacities were evaluated for the original piles, as well as for the piles influenced by the proposed basement construction. After much discussion, which included the use of helical piles to enhance the capacity of the existing piles, spread footings were constructed around a few critical piles.

The test was performed under steady-state climatic loadings representing wet seasons. Uniform moisture loading was achieved by the use of water trays on load cells placed on the bottom plate within the stud cavities of the wall assemblies. This method submits the different wall configurations to wetting by evaporation and drying by evacuating moisture out of the stud cavity. In search for an indicator or yardstick of the relative drying capacity of different wall configurations, a new calculation method by mapping was developed. The method estimates the amounts of moisture absorbed by components surrounding the stud cavity. The moisture transported out of the cavity is the difference between the total water evaporated from the tray and the water absorbed by the wall components. The ratio between the water evaporated and the vapor evacuated is an indicator of the drying capacity of a given wall configuration in relation to others subjected to a predetermined set of conditions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Sufficient cooling is ensured solely by the natural thermal draught. The mounting space has been utilized in the best possible way, which is why it has been possible to extend the converter vessel size to a maximum and considerably increase the specific volume at a given tapping weight as compared with the previous design concept. A novel assembly and installation concept, using special vehicles and suitable hydraulic lifting, turning and shifting equipment, and including the removal and smooth reinstallation of part of a platform, was implemented.

This high cost has resulted in researchers directing their efforts towards modular or 'brick' based storage, which utilise commodity components while employing autonomic principles for the management of the system, reducing the costs incurred during the lifetime of the storage system. While systems based upon this brick structure incorporate high levels of data reliability/availability, they fail to recognise the importance of ensuring the management services of a system are also tolerant of failures (such as optimisation). If system management services are not provided reliably, such storage systems which experience failures will degrade dramatically in performance, especially when the node/s responsible for providing the management fails. This paper addresses the issue of providing fault tolerant management services within brick storage systems. We present in this paper our model of a system that can ensure the integrity and availability of data stored within brick based storage while ensuring the continual execution of the systems management services irrespective of failures within the system. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Brick; Brickmaking; Chlorine compounds; Data storage equipment; Management; Reliability; Reusability; Structural optimization; Brick based storage; Brick storage systems; Commodity components; Fault-tolerant management; Internal storage; International conferences; Management services; Optimisation; Paper addresses; Storage systems; System management; Systems management; Fault tolerant computer systems",Conference Paper,Scopus

The objective was to determine whether it is possible to set EQS for sediments from EQS defined for surface waters in the Daughter Directive of the European Parliament (COM (2006) 397). The analysis of experimental data showed that even though in some specific cases there is a coupling between water column and sediments, this coupling is rather the exception. Therefore it is not recommendable to use water column data to assess the chemical quality status of sediments and it is necessary to measure in both media. At the moment EQS have been defined for the water column and will assess only the compliance with good chemical status of surface waters. Since the sediment toxicity depends on the dissolved pore water concentration, the EQS developed for water could be applied to pore water (interstitial water); hence, there would be no need of developing another set of EQS. The partitioning approach has been proposed as a solution to calculate sediment EQS from water EQS, but the partitioning coefficient strongly depends on sediment characteristics and its use introduces an important uncertainty in the definition of sediment EQS. Therefore, the direct measurement of pore water concentration is regarded as a better option. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Two solution approaches address these needs: First, in the component based software engineering (CBSE) paradigm, software is decomposed into self-contained components with explicit interactions and context dependencies. Connectors represent the abstraction of interactions between these components. Second, components can be shifted from software to reconfigurable hardware, typically field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), in order to meet real-time constraints. This paper proposes a component-based concept to support efficient hardware/software co-design: A hardware component together with the hardware/software connector can seamlessly replace a software component with the same functionality, while the particularities of the alternative interaction are encapsulated in the component connector. Our approach provides for tools that can generate all necessary interaction mechanisms between hardware and software components.

This paper focuses on the construction industry, using thematic analysis to locate the world's best practice with respect to construction and demolition (C&D) waste legislation. It identifies the Netherlands and Denmark as current leaders in C&D waste management and reports on the results of a policy analysis, which concluded that landfill levies, landfill material bans, material segregation and certification are the main contributors to waste reduction. A meta-analysis of Australian state legislation reveals that these policies are largely absent, rendering current legislation ineffective. A model of legislative best practice is presented that is applicable to the Australian context and which incorporates the concept of designing for disassembly - a technique that already exists in other manufacturing industries. By implementing these policies, there is potential to decrease waste through reuse and recycling within the building industry.","Buildings; Codes of practice & standards; Demolition; Structures & design","Best practices; Building industries; Denmark; In buildings; Manufacturing industries; Material segregations; Netherlands; Policy analyses; Reduction strategies; Resource consumptions; Reuse and recycling; State legislations; Waste legislations; Waste reductions; Architectural design; Buildings; Codes (standards); Construction industry; Demolition; Land fill; Laws and legislation; Recycling; Refuse disposal; Waste disposal; Waste management; Structural design",Article,Scopus

An experimental program was undertaken to investigate the influence of various mixture parameters on shrinkage cracking of high-performance SCC designated for structural repair. The parameters included the type of high-range water-reducing admixture (HRWRA), type and content of synthetic fibers, dosage of shrinkage-reducing admixture (SRA), as well as the use of hybrid fibers (HF). An instrumented ring-type setup (ASTM C1581) was used to evaluate cracking potential. Test results indicate that an increase in fiber volume can lead to a decrease in cracking potential of concrete, regardless of the fiber type. On average, the increase in synthetic fiber volume from 0 to 0.25% and 0.25% to 0.50% led to an approximately 40% increase in the elapsed time before restrained shrinkage crack initiation. SCC made with a high concentration of SRA (and no fibers) developed 40% lower drying shrinkage after 56 days of drying and 2.4-folds longer time before cracking compared with similar concrete prepared without any SRA. The combined use of SRA and either synthetic fibers or HF at a dosage rate of 0.25% or 0.50% is quite effective to design high-performance SCC of low cracking potential. Values of drying shrinkage after 7 and 56 days of drying at 50% relative humidity (RH) and modulus of elasticity at the beginning of drying of the restrained shrinkage setup (3 days of age) can be used to estimate the elapsed time to crack initiation due to restrained shrinkage. For a given level of drying shrinkage, an increase in cracking potential can occur when the concrete develops higher elastic modulus at the time of initiation of drying. Similarly, the cracking potential increases with the extent of drying shrinkage deformation for concrete of a given elastic modulus. Copyright © 2008, American Concrete Institute.

The gels were prepared by free-radical crosslinking polymerization of acrylamide (AAm). To suppress the degree of gel inhomogeneity, the crosslinker reactivity during gelation was controlled by decreasing its availability in the reaction system. Our first approach was the addition of the crosslinker N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) (BAAm) in one or three portions during the course of the gelation reactions. As a second approach, a slightly water soluble crosslinker, namely ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDM) was used as a crosslinker in AAm polymerization. Due to the low water solubility of EGDM, EGDM phase in the gelation system act as a reservoir of crosslinker so that the crosslinker can be supplied continuously to the aqueous reaction zone during the course of gelation. It was found that the delayed crosslinker addition technique further increases the degree of inhomogeneity of PAAm hydrogels. The results were explained with increasing viscosity of the reaction solution at the time of the crosslinker addition so that the crosslinking reactions are limited to local regions in the reaction system. The second approach, namely use of the slightly water soluble crosslinker EGDM significantly increases the degree of structural homogeneity of PAAm hydrogels.","Gelation; Homogeneous hydrogels; Inhomogeneity; Light scattering","Acrylic monomers; Addition reactions; Amides; Arsenic compounds; Chemical reactions; Coagulation; Colloids; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Gelation; Gels; Glycols; Hydrogels; Lithography; Monomers; Polymerization; Polymers; Reusability; Acrylamide (PAM); Addition technique; Aqueous reactions; Cross linkers; Cross linking polymerization; Cross-linking reactions; Crosslinker reactivity; Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA); Free-radical; Gelation reactions; In-homogeneity; Increasing viscosity; Local regions; Polyacrylamide (PAAm); Reaction solutions; Reaction systems; Static light scattering (SLS); Structural homogeneity; Water solubilities; Water soluble; Free radical polymerization",Article,Scopus

The premise of the approach is that saline waters can be desalinated by evaporation and condensation of fresh water at near-ambient temperatures at low pressures. Low pressures can be achieved naturally in the head space of water columns of height equal to the local barometric head. By connecting the head space of such a saline water column to that of a distilled water column, and by maintaining the temperature of the former about 15-20°C above that of the latter, fresh water can be evaporated from the saline column and condensed in the distilled water column. In this study, it is proposed to use a sensible heat thermal energy storage (TES) system to heat the head space of the saline water column. The TES can be maintained at the desired temperature using solar energy and/or waste heat from thermal power plants, refrigeration plants, or air conditioning units. This paper presents the feasibility of the proposed approach, where the TES is maintained at the design temperature by a solar-powered absorption refrigeration system (ARS) augmented by an electric heater. Results of this feasibility study show that the heat rejected by an ARS of cooling capacity of 3.25 kW (0.975 tons of refrigeration) along with an additional energy input of 208 kJkg of desalinated water is adequate to produce desalinated water at an average rate of 4.5 kgh.

This would permit the investigation of water resource issues where macrophyte growth, phytoplankton growth, nutrient loadings, and flood control were all contributing factors.

This paper assumes that a first shop is manufacturing new products as well as repairing products used by a second shop. The used products can either be stored in the second shop and then be brought back to the first shop in an approach used to reduce inventory costs, or be disposed outside the system. The works available in the literature assumed a general time interval and ignored the very first time interval where no repair runs are performed. This assumption resulted in an over estimation of the average inventory level and subsequently the holding cost. These works also have not accounted for switching costs when alternating between production and recovery runs, which are common when switching among products or jobs in a manufacturing facility. This paper addresses these two limitations. Mathematical models are developed with numerical examples presented and results discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

During this transformation, a multi-disciplinary knowledge base, created from studies and research about the built environment aspects is fundamental: historical, architectural, archeologically, environmental, social, economic, etc., and critical. Although there are a growing number of applications of 3D VR modelling applications, some built environment applications such as disaster management, environmental simulations, computer-aided architectural design and planning require more sophisticated models beyond 3D graphical visualization such as multifunctional, interoperable, intelligent, and multi-representational. Advanced digital mapping technologies such as 3D laser scanner technologies can be enablers for effective e-planning, consultation and communication of users' views during the planning, design, construction and lifecycle process of the built environment. These technologies can be used to drive the productivity gains by promoting a free-flow of information between departments, divisions, offices, and sites; and between themselves, their contractors and partners when the data captured via those technologies are processed and modelled into building information modelling (BIM). The use of these technologies is a key enabler to the creation of new approaches to the ""Whole Life Cycle"" process within the built and human environment for the twenty-first century. This paper aims to look at this subject. Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes the research towards BIM for existing structures via the point cloud data captured by the 3D laser scanner technology. A case study building is used to demonstrate how to produce 3D CAD models and BIM models of existing structures based on designated techniques. Findings - The paper finds that BIM can be achieved for existing structures by modelling the data captured with 3D laser scanner from the existing world. This can be accomplished by adapting appropriate automated data processing and pattern recognition techniques through applied science research. Practical implications - BMI will enable automated and fast data capture and modelling for not only in design and planning, building refurbishment, effective heritage documentation and VR modelling but also disaster management, environmental analysis, assessment and monitoring, GIS implementation, sophisticated simulation environments for different purposes such as climate change, regeneration simulation for complexity and uncertainty and so on. As a result, it will increase the capability for fast production of virtual reality models and comprehensive and sophisticated simulation platforms. Originality/value - The paper provides useful information on BMI for existing structures.","Buildings; Information modelling; Lasers; Pattern recognition","Assessment and monitoring; Automated data processing; Building Information Modelling; Computer-aided architectural designs; Design/methodology/approach; Environmental simulation; Information modelling; Pattern recognition techniques; Architectural design; Buildings; Climate change; Computer aided design; Data processing; Digital storage; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Environmental management; Knowledge based systems; Laser applications; Lasers; Life cycle; Pattern recognition; Research; Scanning; Structural design; Technology; Three dimensional; Uncertainty analysis; Virtual reality; Three dimensional computer graphics",Article,Scopus

One of the major contributors is agricultural drainage line water. A potential method of reducing this nitrogen discharge to water bodies is the use of immobilized denitrifying sludge (IDS). Our objectives were to (1) produce an effective IDS, (2) determine the IDS reaction kinetics in laboratory column bioreactors, and (3) test a field bioreactor for nitrogen removal from agricultural drainage line water. We developed a mixed liquor suspended solid (MLSS) denitrifying sludge using inoculant from an overland flow treatment system. It had a specific denitrification rate of 11.4 mg NO3-N g-1 MLSS h-1. We used polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to immobilize this sludge and form IDS pellets. When placed in a 3.8-L column bioreactor, the IDS had a maximum removal rate (KMAX) of 3.64 mg NO3-N g-1 pellet d-1. In a field test with drainage water containing 7.8 mg NO3-N L-1, 50% nitrogen removal was obtained with a 1 hr hydraulic retention time. Expressed as a 1 m3 cubically-shaped bioreactor, the nitrogen removal rate would be 94 g NO3-N m-2d-1, which is dramatically higher than treatment wetlands or passive carbonaceous bioreactors. IDS bioreactors offer potential for reducing nitrogen discharge from agricultural drainage lines. More research is needed to develop the bioreactors for agricultural use and to devise effective strategies for their implementation with other emerging technologies for improved water quality on both watershed and basin scales.

For applications near heat generating components, the use of traditional composites in the surrounding structure can be limited by this inability to transport heat through the thickness. 3-D orthogonal weaving provides an efficient, cost effective method of placing high thermal conductivity yarns in the through thickness (Z) direction of a preform, which can in turn yield structural composites with high through thickness thermal conductivity and with in-plane strength or stiffness comparable to traditional laminates. Three basic research efforts investigated the efficacy of this approach; 1) weaving trials to determine the ability to 3-D orthogonal weave pitch carbon fibers and plied copper wires in the through thickness direction of the preforms, 2) through thickness thermal conductivity testing of composites based on 3-D preforms, and 3) thermal modeling to describe several of the phenomena observed during thermal conductivity tests. During the testing, composites based on the 3-D orthogonal preforms with Z fiber volume fractions of only 5.5% measured a 12 fold increase in through thickness thermal conductivity over a composite based on a biaxial laminate, 8.4 versus 0.7 W/mK.

In this paper (Part 2), we present an example scenario to overview the Knowledge Composition Methodology (KCM) that is aimed at satisfying these requirements. The methodology is founded on analysis knowledge building blocks and a model transformation process based on graph transformations. With KCM an analyst may automatically compose an analysis model from a design model and these building blocks. In this paper, we focus on the analysis knowledge component of this methodology (illustrated for structural and thermal disciplines), and describe four dimensions of analysis knowledge. Using these dimensions, we develop a decision template for analysts to create specifications for analysis models. Analysis models can be automatically created from a given specification using model transformation techniques (not described in this paper). We leverage the notion of choices and decisions to (a) define primitive and complex building blocks of analysis knowledge, and (b) formalize an analysis meta-model that represents the structure of analysis models.

These bearings can use the process fluid as the lubricant as in the case of feed water pumps. The process fluid (water) is fed from one end of the bearing, through the multiple axial grooves (groove angles may vary). A non-linear analysis of a rigid rotor supported on journal bearings under unidirectional constant load, unidirectional periodic load, and variable rotating load is carried out. The time-dependent Reynolds equation in two-dimension for incompressible fluid is solved numerically by the finite-difference method with a successive over relaxation scheme satisfying the Jakobsson-Floberg-Olsson boundary conditions, to obtain the hydrodynamic forces. Using these forces, the equations of motion are solved by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to predict the transient behaviour of the rotor. The analysis gives the orbital trajectory within the clearance circle. © IMechE 2008.","Multiple axial grooves; Stability; Unidirectional constant load; Unidirectional periodic load; Variable rotating load; Water-lubricated journal bearing","Bearings (structural); Boundary conditions; Boundary value problems; Difference equations; Differentiation (calculus); Equations of motion; Finite difference method; Fluid dynamics; Fluid mechanics; Journal bearings; Lubrication; Reusability; Runge Kutta methods; Transient analysis; Axial grooves; Boundary conditioning; Constant load; Feed water; Finite differencing; Hydrodynamic forcing; Incompressible fluids; Lubricated journal bearings; Multiple axial grooves; Non-linear analysis; Non-linear transient analysis; Orbital trajectory; Periodic load; Process fluids; Rotating load; Stability; Stability characteristics; Successive Over-Relaxation; Time-dependent reynolds equation; Unidirectional constant load; Unidirectional periodic load; Variable rotating load; Water-lubricated journal bearing; Water analysis",Article,Scopus

Some of them, like Germany, Australia and Canada have established their own recommendation guide for recycling concrete [1,2]. The recycling consists of crushing old concrete into aggregates, and then processing it into new mixture using recycled aggregates with specified sizes [3,4]. The aim of this recycling is to save nature from deforestation and dryness, by reducing the need to gravel and so the quarries work, and also to economize the waste management [5,6]. The present research work consists of an experimental study assessing the impact of using recycled aggregates on the concrete behavior and on the country's economy. We are especially interested in determining the best composition for the new mixture of concrete resulting from reusing different types of recycled aggregates. Different types of tests have been done depending on the aggregates sizes, their origin and their state (burned or safe). The analysis is based on the comparison between compressive strength, water-cement ratio, slump, porosity and durability. Otherwise, the impact on economy is analyzed, a priori, by studying the effect of reducing the cost of the resulting concrete on construction spending. The resulted recommendations indicate the sizes of aggregates which may constitute the best composition for recycling and processing concrete, and the best use for each type of concrete depending on behavior and economy effect.

The needs of disaster victims for the temporary shelters and houses should be met rapidly. In that way the victims have chance for returning back to their daily life activities as soon as possible. Thus, national and international aids-resources used in post-disaster construction activities were mainly focused on sheltering and housing after the emergency phase. Consequently, temporary housing sites were frequently constructed as a solution on the aftermath of the disaster. The purpose of this study is to research temporary housing sites reuse and recycle potentials after occupancy in the case study of Duzce, Turkey. Solution proposals for obtaining the sustainability of the temporary housing sites were determined with respect to the observations made in production, occupancy, dismantling and evacuation processes of the temporary housing sites in a case study by taking the existing dwellers' expectations into consideration. The results showed the need for pre-disaster design and organization to accelerate reuse and recycle potentials of the houses and sites.

In this study, mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of dodecanethiol and a tripyridyl porphyrin attached to a thiol tether via a perfluorinated phenyl ring (TPy3PF4-SC5SH) were prepared on Au(111) substrates. The synthetic strategy allows for rapid formation of derivatives with different tethers. The surface structural and electronic properties of mixed monolayer SAMs of the porphyrin inserted into the dodecanethiol matrix were investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), Fourier transform infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (FT-IRAS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also employed to evaluate the analytical vibrational frequencies of the TPy 3PF4-SC5SH molecule as well as its electronic structure. For the mixed monolayers, the morphology of the porphyrin molecules was probed by STM where it was found that the molecules assembled into domains of ∼2 and 6 nm. AFM shows that the molecules protrude above the n-dodecanethiol layer by ∼0.9 nm, while by STM, apparent heights of only ∼0.5 nm were observed, suggesting limited tunneling efficiency. Stochastic switching of the porphyrin molecules was also observed during STM measurements in the mixed monolayer and is likely associated with conformational changes within the monolayer since these molecules tended to insert near defects within the SAM. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Au (1 1 1); Dodecanethiol (DT); Electronic components; Optical (PET) (OPET); Perfluorinated; Phenyl rings; Self assembled monolayers (SAMs); Synthesis and characterization; Electronic properties; Porphyrins; Reusability; Self assembled monolayers",Article,Scopus

In this force field, only nonbonded parameters are used to describe Zn-O interactions. The CVFF force field was used with slight modifications to describe the benzene dicarboxylate linker. The force field correctly predicts a wide range of structural properties of this MOF, including a negative thermal expansion of approximately 1% at 30 and 293 K, in agreement with both theory and experiment. Compressibility results and the associated elastic moduli are in also good agreement with published density functional theory calculations and nanoindentation experiments. The force field predicts a decrease in elastic moduli as temperature increases, which would greatly affect the mechanical properties of MOFs. Calculated vibrational frequencies for Zn - O modes agree with experiment, and a low-frequency mode representing a 180° rotation of the phenyl groups is seen. This rotation becomes more prevalent as the temperature is increased from 300 to 400 K, in agreement with NMR data. Simulations were also carried out with adsorbed guests, including ethanol, cyclohexane, and several chloromethanes. It is shown that the IRMOF-1 lattice parameter depends on the nature of the guest-framework interaction; strongly hydrophilic guests, such as ethanol, cause a decrease (-0.9%) in unit cell volume, while hydrophobic guests cause an increase (0.7-1.5%) in unit cell volume. The calculated free volumes in IRMOF-1 range from 53.5% to 56.0%, in good agreement with experiment. Finally, the activation energy for benzene self-diffusion calculated at low loadings is in good agreement with previous simulations and NMR results, but the magnitude of the diffusion constant is underestimated, most likely because of deficiencies in the CVFF portion of the force field. The results demonstrate, however, that employing a rigid force field results in much poorer agreement with experimental data. Additionally, a flexible force field approach is required when simulating framework stability because of physical changes or the presence of adsorbates. The use of a general-purpose force field for the organic components allows our approach to be extended to other Zn-based frameworks. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"American Chemical Society (ACS); Chloromethanes; Density functional theory (DFT) calculations; Diffusion constants; Experimental data; Flexible force; Force field (FF); Force field validation; Hydrophobic guests; Lattice parameters; Low frequency (LF); Metal organic framework (MOF); Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS); Nanoindentation experiments; Negative thermal expansion (NTE); NMR data; Organic components; Phenyl groups; Phy sical changes; Self diffusions; Unit-cell volume; Vibrational frequencies; Wide-range; Zinc carboxylate; Activation energy; Benzene; Biomechanics; Carboxylation; Density functional theory; Dynamics; Ethanol; Experiments; Flow interactions; Mechanical properties; Metals; Molecular dynamics; Nanofluidics; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Probability density function; Quantum chemistry; Reusability; Rotation; Semiconductor doping; Thermal expansion; Thermal spraying; Zinc; Zinc sulfide; Elastic moduli",Article,Scopus

The study reported here compares the advantages and disadvantages of using traditional timber formwork and a large panel steel formwork system Integrated with precast concrete semi-slab (composite formwork system) in superstructure construction in Hong Kong. The study compares these two different formwork systems used in two identically designed school projects in Hong Kong. The comparisons are focused on construction cost, time required for completion of work and construction waste generation. By conducting a detailed cost comparison, this paper shows that, despite the fact that the composite formwork system is able to produce less construction waste, the traditional timber formwork system is still more favourable economically. However, if the composite formwork could be reused in other standard school projects after completion of the project, economic advantages would be realised.","Economics & finance; Temporary works; Waste management & disposal","Building materials; Concrete slabs; Construction industry; Reinforced concrete; Structural panels; Timber; Waste management; Wooden construction; Concrete semi-slab; Metal formwork systems; Reinforced-concrete superstructures; Timber formwork systems; Structural analysis",Article,Scopus

Extensive characterisation studies showed that Al/HOM-2 composites revealed higher surface area, smaller pore sizes and thicker pore wall than those of unloaded-HOM-2 monoliths, indicating that Al might be impregnated into the inner pores and the wall frameworks of HOM-2 silica monoliths. The adsorption experiments of aniline were investigated by using batch techniques. The results obtained showed that the aniline molecule strongly adsorbed onto the aluminosilicate mesostructures.

Inside the building active water and high humidity can result in corrosion of HVAC, electronic equipment, as well as damage or disrupt mission critical electronic equipment. In the adjacent backfill and the structure itself, excessive water can seriously compromise the structural hardening of the facility. Thus, it is vital to Army sustainability to control moisture in below-grade structures and eliminate corrosion of electrical mechanical equipment. This also prevents mold growth on the interior surface of below grade concrete walls and floors. Control of water movement involves both actively removing water in and around a building, and the use of barriers to prevent water from penetrating to interior spaces. A pumping system is typically required with the use of a barrier system to assist in controlling the movement of moisture into the structure. Conventional waterproofing technologies are expensive and often have short service life. A new approach is needed - a cost effective and robust solution-to the pervasive problem of water intrusion. Electro-Osmotic Pulse is a promising alternative solution presented here. Electro-Osmotic Pulse (EOP) technology uses pulses of electricity to reverse the flow of water seepage. The applied voltage causes moisture to flow out of the basement walls and away from the building. The technology works by alternately pulsating a direct electric field with an off period. The first part of the sequence consists of a pulse of positive voltage (as seen from the dry side of the concrete wall), followed by a pulse of negative voltage. This is followed by a period when no voltage is applied. Of the three parts, the positive voltage pulse has the greatest time duration. The amplitude of the positive signal is typically on the order of 20 to 40 Volts DC. This electrical pulse causes cations (e.g., Ca++) and associated water molecules to move from the dry side (anode) towards the wet side (cathode) against the direction of flow induced by the hydraulic gradient, thus preventing water penetration through buried concrete structures. Laboratory and field tests have shown an increase in calcium compounds at the cathode side of test specimens. The negative portion of the pulse increases the efficiency of moisture movement by depolarizing the electrodes. Electro-Osmotic Pulse (EOP) technology has been successfully installed in military structures such as family housing, steel reinforced deep structures, and tunnels. EOP has also been implemented on Civilian structures such as residential structures, D.C. Metro Tunnels, and an underground treasury vault. EOP has been shown to prevent moisture seepage into below-grade structures. It is effective at keeping concrete surfaces at or below 50 percent humidity content, meaning the treated space stays dry, indoor relative humidity stays low, and no mold or mildew can grow. This technology has received the 2002 international NOVA award for innovation in construction, and twice nominated for the CERF Pankow award (1999 and 2004). The ERDC research on this technology has also been recognized by the 2004 Army Research and Development Achievement Award.","Concrete; Corrosion; Electro-osmosis; Electro-osmotic pulse; Moisture mitigation underground structure; Water intrusion; Waterproofing","Amplifiers (electronic); Buildings; Calcium; Computer networks; Control equipment; Corrosion; Corrosion prevention; Corrosion resistance; Cost effectiveness; Electric fields; Electric potential; Electricity; Electroacupuncture; Electromagnetic field theory; Electromagnetic fields; Electromagnetism; Electronic equipment; Electroosmosis; Hardening; Hardness; Health; Magnetism; Mechanical control equipment; Moisture; Moisture control; Neodymium; Offshore oil well production; Oscillators (electronic); Osmosis; Seepage; Service life; Technology; Turbulent flow; Walls (structural partitions); Weight control; Well equipment; (1 1 0) surface; (OTDR) technology; Applied (CO); Applied voltages; Below-grade structures; Buried structures; Concrete structures; concrete walls; Electrical pulses; Flow out; High humidity; Mechanical equipments; mold growth; negative voltages; new approaches; Penetration resistance (PR); Positive voltage; Robust solutions; Structural hardening; time duration; U.S. army; water intrusions; water movements; Water seepage; Reusability",Conference Paper,Scopus

The fact is that the current worldwide agreement for object orientation is not supported by enough empirical evidence on advantages and disadvantages of object orientation vs. other paradigms in different phases of the software development process. In this work we describe an empirical study focused on comparing the time required for analyzing a data management system by using both object orientation and a structural technique. We choose the approach indicated by the Rational Unified Process, and the Structured Analysis and Design Technique, as instances of object oriented and structured analysis techniques, respectively. The empirical study that we present considers both an uncontrolled and a controlled experiment with Master students. Its aim is to analyze the effects of those techniques to software analysis both for software development from scratch, and enhancement maintenance, respectively. Results show no significant difference in the time required for developing or maintaining a software application by applying those two techniques, whatever is the order of their application. However we found two major tendencies regarding object orientation: 1) it is more sensitive to subjects' peculiarities, and 2) it is able to provide some reusability advantages already at the analysis level. Since such result concerns a one-hour-size enhancement maintenance, we expect significant benefits from using object orientation, in case of real-size extensions.","Empirical software engineering; Object oriented analysis; Software engineering; Structured analysis","Controlled experiment; Data management system; Empirical evidence; Empirical software engineering; Empirical studies; Experimental studies; Object orientation; Object oriented; Object oriented analysis; Object oriented paradigm; Rational Unified Process; Size extension; Software analysis; Software applications; Software development; Software development process; Structured analysis; Structured approach; Computer software; Computer software maintenance; Reusability; Software design; Object oriented programming",Conference Paper,Scopus

It is the intent of this paper to present a set of standardized assumptions for typical commercial buildings. These assumptions were developed from the criteria in ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004, Energy Standard for Buildings Except Low-Rise Residential Buildings (ASHRAE 2004b), and prior published work outlining the typical use patterns and energy densities. Having a documented set of typical commercial buildings is very important when doing a comparative analysis of different energy-efficiency measures, and the set can serve as a standard set for the development of computer tools that perform such analysis. This standardized set is also very important for the development of prescriptive requirements for Standard 90.1. The present set of prescriptive requirements was developed with and is currently being updated with an inconsistent set of building assumptions using various levels of simplification. Previous studies have been published in this area, but none of them provided full and comprehensive lists that could be used to build complete energy models. Therefore, it is intended that by providing the key program inputs, future results can be duplicated and further analysis can be performed using the identical baseline. © 2007 ASHRAE.",,"American society; Annual meetings; Building design processes; Building energy simulations; Building simulations; Code development; commercial buildings; Commissioning process; Comparative analysis; computer tools; End uses; energy analysis; Energy components; energy densities; energy efficiencies; Energy modeling; energy savings; Residential buildings; Standard 90.1; system parameters; Architectural design; Computer networks; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy resources; Heating; Office buildings; Paper; Parameter estimation; Process design; Process engineering; Reusability; Standardization; Standards; Structural design; Buildings",Conference Paper,Scopus

Laboratory tests are reported on the structural performance of walls, beams and columns. Horizontal loading tests of walls and bending tests of beams along their strong axes reveal that the energy-absorbing capacities of both are high. Bending tests on walls and columns along their weak axis showed that both have high elastic deformation capacity.

The utilisation of recycled aggregates is a good solution to the problem of an excess of waste material, provided that the desired final product quality is reached. The studies on the use of recycled aggregates have been going on for 50 years. In fact, none of the results showed that recycled aggregates are unsuitable for structural use. However, some hypothetical problems related to durability aspects resulted in recycled aggregates being employed practically only as base filler for road construction. This paper focuses on the possibility of the use of recycled aggregate concrete as a structural material. For that purpose an experimental study of the shear behaviour and strength of beams made with recycled aggregate concrete was studied. Twelve beam specimens with the same compression strength, four concrete mixtures using different percentages of recycled coarse aggregates (0%, 25%, 50% and 100%) and three different transverse reinforcement arrangements were cast and tested up to failure. Analytical predictions of the experimental results were carried out using a numerical model based on the modified compression field theory and simplified models such as those proposed by Cladera & Mari, the Canadian standard CSA and the Eurocode-2. The results obtained indicate that a substitution of less than 25% of coarse aggregate, scarcely affects the shear capacity of RC beams, provided that all measures related to dosage and durability aspects have been adopted. © RILEM 2007.","Recycled aggregate concrete; Recycled aggregates; Shear strength; Structural behaviour","Aggregates; Building materials; Compressive strength; Construction industry; Recycling; Shear strength; Recycled aggregate concrete; Recycled aggregates; Structural behaviour; Concretes",Article,Scopus

Many students undertook both models during their program of study and as a result reaped the benefits of their developed skills in a fairly new realm of engineering, i.e. sustainable engineering and green construction. The outcomes of implementing these two models were visible and appeared in the students' efforts to create and invent new products, some of which have been already built and utilized by them.

In addition to the applications mentioned above which are related to the in-service phase, the sensors could also be used during the manufacturing phase and for repair of the structure.

However, use of real 1553 data busses within simulation and development environments can be unnecessarily restrictive. To use a real bus, expensive cards must be purchased and additional cabling must be used to connect the various system components. In these environments, it would be ideal if existing commodity hardware and communications infrastructure could be utilized to interconnect the simulation or development components. To realize this goal, the MIL-STD-1553 data bus must be virtualized, making the data bus's protocol independent of the communication mechanism used to transmit information. The idea is to move functionality from hardware into software, in essence, create a completely software-based 1553 card simulator (i.e. a virtual 1553 card). The author will refer to this simulation as virtual 1553 throughout this paper. Virtual 1553 can provide a great deal of flexibility and cost savings to developers of systems or simulations utilizing the 1553 data bus. At present, a prototype of this technology has been used to replace physical 1553 connections between the astronauts' command and control software and emulated flight computers in an International Space Station (ISS) simulator developed by United Space Alliance. Use of virtual 1553 has led to reduced deployment costs for the simulator, as neither 1553 cards nor cabling are required and existing hardware is used instead for the 1553 simulation.

The line system is located on a peninsula and consists of a number of steel and wood pole lines terminated at various substations. The line system extends over a severe icing zone known for glaze icing. A system approach was used in assessing the existing line reliability. The reliability analysis provided a ""trend line"" for the observed rate of failure. The original design ice load was updated based on the observed failure rate over a 30-year period. To ensure that the tower fails first before the conductor, a trapezoidal conductor specially designed with extra high strength steel core was used for the upgrading project. The existing suspension towers were reused with two special dead end towers designed to accommodate the increased conductor tension due to the revised ice load. Three spans were considered in the upgrading study. The optimum upgrading option is presented for the steel transmission line system and is based on the cost risk model which used the ruling span (conductor tension) as one of the primary variables for optimization.

Due to TCP dynamics, throughput of data transfers can be much lower than the available bandwidth in wide area networks. Splitting a TCP connection into two or more segments has been shown to improve throughput in this setting. This paper presents a set of components to enable easy deployment of overlay networks that make use of split-TCP connections to improve GridFTP transfer performance. The components include an extension to the Globus Toolkit v4 GridFTP server that supports split TCP connections, a service to estimate bulk transfer capacity and a service to determine if and where to split a connection.

It is assumed that the application of complex science to environmental design methods for cities and buildings has a large potentiality for the temporal designing method that intends to maintain rationality of a structure by adapting to natural and social changes that occur over time. One of the problems that modern architectural design is that the rigid relationship between parts and a whole becomes a roadblock when one is adapting to social and human conditions that change during the process of planning. In this paper, the dynamic forming method of this relationship between parts and a whole is defined as self-organization. In the examples of this simulation for building a housing complex, adaptability required for systems were confirmed by observing changes of the external environmental conditions on the built systems and the change of the assumed usage condition and the effect of the simulation. This system is designed for constructing a apartment unit as a modular parts. Simulation of decision making for configuration by computer program is also conducted for this system. This system uses three dimensional cell-automaton calculation and treats a three-dimensional apartment unit as a building that generates changes of its configuration. This system can maintain a certain level of performance even when the initial configuration is changed in many ways. Thus, compared with regular designing methods, this system has a much greater ability of adopting for changing conditions. With this innovative methods of construction, materials used for building can be used repeatedly. Reusing building materials can save resources. Uniformed monotony can be avoided as it allows diversification at parts. Diversification is a characteristic that a complex system needs to maintain adaptability.

Unfortunately, current BPS tools do not allow inter-tool communication and thus limit a modeler to the component models available in the simulation software which happens to be used. A pragmatic way forward would be to enable co-simulation by externally coupled (legacy) tools. This means that each coupled software would represent only that part of the overall building and system configuration that it is able to model. The overall system is represented by the coupled models, which exchange simulation data during run-time. In this way, shortcomings of each tool can be overcome, and advantages of individual tools can be exploited. The work underlying this paper addresses co-simulation of building energy and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) models. So far, the research focus has been on thermodynamic issues such as which variables should be exchanged and at what frequency, rather than on mathematic or computer science aspects. This paper specifies and discusses the requirements for BPS software in order to enable co-simulation of building and HVAC system configurations.","Building performance simulation; Co-simulation; Distributed modeling and simulation; External coupling; Reuse; Run-time coupling","Buildings; Computer aided software engineering; Computer science; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Thermodynamics; Building performance simulation; Co-simulation; Distributed modeling; External coupling; Run-time coupling; Structural design",Conference Paper,Scopus

This interest is driven partly by the recent adoption in Canada of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) Green Building Rating System and partly by a greater general awareness of environmental issues. Designers are beginning to look at how to incorporate reused steel components into construction projects, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions by saving on primary steel production. However, although some designers are willing to redesign their projects to make use of available reclaimed structural steel components, it is often difficult to identify suitable materials in the local area at the appropriate time in the life of a project. A limiting factor is that designers, construction companies, and others perceive a lack of a well-established and easily available mechanism for exchange of reclaimed components. This paper reviews the issues that are relevant to increasing recycling and reuse in construction and focuses on examples that illustrate the benefits that steel can bring to sustainable construction. In particular, it discusses the issues relevant to designing to enable future disassembly and the way in which steel components can be readily reused. © 2006 NRC Canada.","Design for deconstruction; Reclaimed steel; Reuse of materials; Steel recycling; Sustainable construction","Buildings; Construction industry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Steel structures; Design for deconstruction; Reclaimed steel; Reuse of materials; Steel recycling; Sustainable construction; Steel construction; Buildings; Construction industry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Steel construction; Steel structures; building; design; recycling; steel structure; Canada; North America",Review,Scopus

Reuse occurs largely through social knowledge networks. Even when reuse from an external repository occurs, a human expert is needed to provide input on what to reuse and contextual information about the designs being reused. This is attributed to the effectiveness of internal knowledge reuse, the reuse of knowledge from one's personal experiences. Internal knowledge reuse is effective because the designer can find items to reuse, and can recall the context of these items and can therefore understand them. This ethnographic study was used to develop a corporate memory, a rich, detailed repository of knowledge in context. The corporate memory will support finding and understanding. Understanding can be brought about by enabling the designer to explore the item's context. This helps the designer to manage the tradeoff between productivity and creativity in deciding what to reuse.","Design reuse; Engineering design; Ethnography; Knowledge management","Construction industry; Industrial management; Productivity; Reusability; Design reuse; Engineering design; Ethnography; Knowledge management; Structural design",Article,Scopus

Key factors affecting the viability of object reuse are the properties of the object itself (structural reuse and contextual reuse); and the organisation's preparedness to undertake learning object reuse (operational reuse and strategic reuse). Structural reusability is a function of how the object has been engineered. Contextual reusability is determined by the applicability of the object to new learning events and factors affecting potential audience size. Operational reusability has dependencies on organisational culture, personnel, procedures and technology. Strategic reusability is a function of organisational strategy that may favour systematic or opportunistic reuse of objects. The four-tier model is designed to aid organisations in evaluating the viability of implementing learning object reuse and determining the potential benefits, so that design for reuse efforts can be prioritised and focussed effectively.","E-learning; Learning object; Reuse; SCORM","Curricula; Learning systems; Mathematical models; Personnel; Societies and institutions; Strategic planning; Operational reusability; Shareable content object reference model (SCORM); Strategic reusability; E-learning",Conference Paper,Scopus

To run the simulation as efficiently as possible, the workload should be uniformly distributed over the nodes. Current RTI implementations are very static, and do not allow any load balancing. Load balancing of a HLA federation can be achieved by scheduling new federates on the node with least load and migrating executing federates from a highly loaded node to a lightly loaded node.

However, there is often confusion in understanding the objectives of validation and when choosing an appropriate protocol to follow. This paper describes the fundamental rationale behind validation. The primary principle behind performance validation is to ensure that public and environmental health is being safeguarded. To do this, regulations must set risk-based disinfection targets, and reactors must be shown to have adequate performance in terms of those targets. Validation must be based on empirical results to eliminate assumptions that are unsafe. Validation must be universal for a given reactor, so that it can be applied to any site where the reactor may be installed. Protocols must not be prescriptive with consequential hindrance to innovation, and they must not be too complex so that they can be accepted and implemented by the industry. This paper expands on these major points, showing examples of how validation protocols can violate these principles, and also showing alternatives that uphold the principles, ensuring that public and environmental health is safeguarded.","Multiple barrier protection; Performance; Ultraviolet drinking water disinfection; Validation","Accident prevention; Disinfection; Health; Performance; Protection; Reusability; Risks; Structural design; Ultraviolet radiation; Wastewater treatment; Multiple barrier protection; Reuse water; Ultraviolet drinking water disinfection; Validation; Water treatment",Article,Scopus

To establish the growth behavior, each vehicle's baseline solution was modified for percentage increases or decreases in the baseline empty weight from +10% to -10% after which each vehicle system was then resolved. The identification of the trends in these solutions enables the determination of the growth factor for each vehicle configuration. The growth factor characterizes the system's sensitivity to changes in structural weight arising from technological uncertainty. Systems with high growth factors represent a greater amount of design risk as they may rapidly scale out of control if expected technology levels fail to materialize. This understanding may also be applied to measure the extent of improvements possible from application of more advanced technology. Several other figures of merit were also used to evaluate the growth solutions including: empty weight, wetted area, and gross weight. The assessment revealed that the straightforward two-stage-to-orbit reusable rocket is a challenging vehicle for the air-breathing configurations to beat. The horizontal takeoff single-stage-to-orbit airbreathers in particular have higher empty weights, increased wetted area and drastically higher empty weight growth factors compared to the two-stage rockets. The two-stage horizontal takeoff air-breathing boosters / rocket orbiters make improvements in growth factor, but lag behind the two-stage rockets in the other measures. The vertical takeoff single-stage and two-stage air-breathers measure up much more evenly with the two-stage rockets and appear to be the reasonable choice for the development path of air-breathing technology and may represent an improved capability beyond that of the all rocket systems.

This new approach has the ability to reshape the vehicle's commanded trajectory onboard, in real-time for significantly changed energy conditions due to, for example, control effector failures. The approach also has the ability of retargeting the trajectory to abort to more appropriate alternative landing sites. The key feature of the new approach is an innovative optimization method: by describing decision variables in terms of appropriate basis functions, the trajectory optimization problem can be reformulated to find the relatively few basis function coefficients that characterize the desired trajectory. This significantly reduces the search domain, enabling rapid convergence to feasible solutions. An entry trajectory optimization problem was formulated, incorporating real-world vehicle constrains such as heating and dynamic pressure boundaries. It was demonstrated that the trajectory could be reshaped in-fight for both low and high energy cases. Furthermore, the approach was demonstrated to retarget to two defined alternate landing sites. The nominal landing site was defined to be Kennedy Space Center in Florida, while the two alternate landing sites were Atlanta and Houston. For a standard desktop computer, the time to realize a solution was reduced From one to two minutes using a traditional optimization method to only approximately 10 seconds for the new formulation. The ability to rapidly and accurately reshape trajectory commands to perturbations in energy, and the ability to retarget the trajectory to alternate landing sites was successfully demonstrated.

The resulting gap is threatening with slowing down such a phenomenal growth. The design community believes that it is only by means of powerful CAD tools and design methodologies -and, possibly, a design paradigm shift-that this design gap can be bridged. In this sense, reuse-based design is seen as a promising solution, and concepts such as IP Block, Virtual Component, and Design Reuse have become commonplace thanks to the significant advances in the digital arena. Unfortunately, the very nature of analog and mixed-signal (AMS) design has hindered a similar level of consensus and development. This paper presents a framework for the reuse-based design of AMS circuits. The framework is founded on three key elements: (1) a CAD-supported hierarchical design flow that facilitates the incorporation of AMS reusable blocks, reduces the overall design time, and expedites the management of increasing AMS design complexity; (2) a complete, clear definition of the AMS reusable block, structured into three separate facets or views: the behavioral, structural, and layout facets, the two first for top-down electrical synthesis and bottom-up verification, the latter used during bottom-up physical synthesis; (3) the design for reusability set of tools, methods, and guidelines that, relying on intensive parameterization as well as on design knowledge capture and encapsulation, allows to produce fully reusable AMS blocks. A case study and a functional silicon prototype demonstrate the validity of the paper's proposals.","Analog and Mixed-Signal IP Block; CAD; Design for Reusability; Design Reuse","Computer aided design; Integration; Reusability; Semiconductor materials; Silicon; Software prototyping; Analog and Mixed-Signal IP Block; Design for reusability; Design reuse; Integration capacity; Integrated circuits",Conference Paper,Scopus

At present, this kind of reuse is still not common due to the risk of alkali-silica reaction between the alkalis of cement and silica of the waste glass. This expansive reaction can cause great problems of cracking and, consequently, it can be extremely deleterious for the durability of mortar and concrete. However, data reported in the literature show that if the waste glass is finely ground, under 75 μm, this effect does not occur and mortar durability is guaranteed. Therefore, in this work the possible reactivity of waste glass with the cement paste in mortars was verified, by varying the particle size of the finely ground waste glass. No reaction has been detected with particle size up to 100 μm thus indicating the feasibility of the waste glass reuse as fine aggregate in mortars and concrete. In addition, waste glass seems to positively contribute to the mortar micro-structural properties resulting in an evident improvement of its mechanical performance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In most applications, cement based materials are used for building construction due to their cost effectiveness and performance; however their impact on the surrounding environment should be monitored. The interstitial pore fluid in contact with hydrated cementitious materials is characterized by persistent alkaline pH values buffered by the presence of hydrate calcium silicate, portlandite and alkaline ions. An experimental plan was carried out to investigate concrete structural properties in relation to alkali release in aqueous solution. Results indicate that the presence of recycled aggregate increases the leachability of unreactive ions (Na, K, Cl), while for calcium the substitution resulted in a lower net leaching.

To study the performance and size of an air-collection based booster, an initial airplane like shape was established as a baseline and modeled in a vehicle sizing code. The code, SIZER, contains a general series of volume, surface area, and fuel fraction relationships that tie engine and ACES performance with propellant requirements and volumetric constraints in order to establish vehicle closure for the given mission.

The study includes a survey of different foundation systems that can be used when the construction site is on a slope, rocks, variable terrain, liquid surface, or immersed within a liquid (Howe, 2000). Since most of the high priority sites with scientific interests present some difficulties for landing and setting up research stations (Cohen, 1998), this study investigates how the substructure can deploy and help to settle or establish a reliable platform for primary structures, based on the idea of a kit-of-parts system. Since the interface with the primary structures is important to have unified structural system, the model of the primary structures would be based on the characteristics of Class II Space habitats (Kennedy, 2002). Although in the discussion, Class I and Class III habitats would be involved, this is to ensure some structural components used in Class I can be reused in Class II development and help to construct or deploy Class III habitats. The focus is on self-deployable secondary support structures that minimize the space occupied in launching and provide large, lightweight structures that are low-cost (Tsunoda & Senbokuya, 2002a). The foldability during stowage, and unfoldablitiy during set up are crucial criteria in the selection of structure (Cohen, 1986), therefore the procedure for packing, stowage, launching, deployment and maintenance is discussed in the paper (Kronenburg, 1996). © 2003 by A.

Due to technical limitations with ground based test facilities, real flight testing of hot structures on operational vehicles in terms of validation of materials and design concepts is certainly the most important issue. In the past ten years, multiple reentry flight tests with samples and structural components of DLR's C/CSiC material have been performed. In this paper some TPS flight experiments are described in detail, beginning with first material specimens, which were integrated into the ablative heat shield of Russian FOTON capsules in 1992 and 1994. With more complex C/C-SiC structures like the CETEX (CEramic Tile EXperiment) experiment which was flown during the EXPRESS mission in early 1995 and further developments as the nose cap structure of NASA's X-38 vehicle, it was intended to evaluate latest design concepts and improved coating systems as integral part of a TPS structure. Consequently a new reentry experiment was set up in 2001 which was also integrated into the ablative heat shield of the new FOTON-M1 capsule series. Unfortunately the launch of the Soyuz carrier system in October 2002 failed and the FOTON capsule was destroyed approximately 20 seconds after lift-off. Material relevant experience gained by reentry flight experiments is correlated with the results achieved by extended ground testing and some considerations based on theoretical models. During reentry, physical limits for C/C-SiC material are defined by oxidation resistance, passive-active transition conditions and erosion effects. Special emphasis is given to the passive-active transition behavior of SiC and the related 'temperature jump effect'. Finally the behavior of different anti oxidation coating systems and their suitability for this purpose are considered. © 2003 by DLR, German Aerospace Center.

The ultimate objective is to identify an optimum liner and coating design that produces stress and deformation fields leading to improved life/durability. A reference case based on the work of previous studies is introduced and subsequent changes in geometry and materials are investigated. Analyses are accomplished through the application of the cylindrical version of the higher-order theory for functionally graded materials/structural components. This theory provides a unique analytical tool for the design of advanced aircraft engine structural components with active cooling channels based on the concept of functionally graded material architectures through which improved deformation and life can be attained. The sensitivity of the cooling channel wall deformation to changes in the wall thickness is demonstrated which is commensurate with the observed failure mode.

With the launch of the space shuttle in 1981, the U.S. had its first reusable spaceplane and was on its way toward routine space flight. Since the launch of the first shuttle, many concepts have been proposed to offering improved performance over the space shuttle system. One such class of concepts is hypersonic airbreathing reusable launch vehicles. These vehicles have been analyzed and studied in detail for over the past 40 years. Most of the analysis, however, has focused solely on engine and vehicle performance. Today, both NASA and DoD are placing ever-increasing importance on the system safety, reliability, maintainability, operability, and supportability. This paper will begin to address these issues for one particular concept in the hypersonic airbreathing reusable launch vehicle class. The vehicle is a single stage to orbit, horizontal takeoff and landing system that has heritage to the Access to Space study of 1993. A general description of the concept (called ABLV-4e) is given including its propulsion system design and operating modes, vehicle structural and tank concepts and materials, thermal protection system, and other aspects. System technologies are described, and the vehicle closure is stated for the reference mission (20Klb due East LEO). Following a description of the vehicle performance, detail is provided on the analysis and initial quantification of the system safety, reliability, operability, and cost. Descriptions of the models and assumptions used to quantify each of the characteristics mentioned are included. Also included is a description of the FASTPACT analysis framework developed by SAIC in which these life cycle models and analysis capabilities reside. Finally, initial estimates for Loss of Vehicle, Loss of Mission, Recurring Cost, and Turn-around Time as well as DDT&E and Theoretical First Unit Costs are given. Shortcomings in the analysis tools are discussed, as well as lessons learned and future plans.",,"Aerospace vehicles; Cost benefit analysis; Hypersonic vehicles; Launch vehicles; Launching; Life cycle; NASA; Orbits; Reliability analysis; Reusability; Reusable rockets; Space flight; Space shuttles; Analysis capabilities; Analysis frameworks; General description; Life cycle analysis; Reusable launch vehicles; Single stage to orbits; Space transportations; Thermal Protection System; Vehicle performance",Conference Paper,Scopus

Aeroelastic behavior is studied for 5 < M < 15 at altitudes of 40,000 and 70,000 feet. A parametric study of offsets, wedge angles, and static angle of attack is conducted. All the solutions are fairly close below the flutter boundary, and differences between the various models increase when the flutter boundary is approached. For this geometry, differences between viscous and inviscid aeroelastic behavior are not substantial. Results illustrate that aerodynamic heating reduces aeroelastic stability.

This suite of tools includes a high-fidelity hypersonic/supersonic/subsonic panel code (ZONAIR), a prototypical TPS thermal sizing procedure, a robust, yet simplified aerothermodynamic code that is based on a streamline methodology (ZSTREAM), a trajectory analysis code (POST) and a structural optimization software system (ASTROS*).

Next, computed heat rates by applying ZONA aerothermoelastic software to X-34 though two assigned hypersonic trajectories were shown and found to agree well with those using MINIVER. The prototypical TPS thermal sizing procedure was employed to obtain a minimum weight TPS design per hot-wall consideration.

The study focused on nitrogen and phosphorus removal, operational problems, and duckweed application. Two full-scale trial plants at Nemanwa and Gutu-Mupandawana growth points were used. Sewage samples were collected and analysed monthly from September 2000 to August 2001 for NO3, NH4-, TKN, TP, COD, and other field measurements. The duckweed was harvested daily and fed to chickens. The Nemanwa plant had high nutrient levels due to nil outflows caused by water rationing in the area. The Gutu effluent had averages of 38.7 ± 23.1 mg/l TN and 7.5 ± 2.4 mg/l TP which are above the respective Zimbabwean standards of 10 mg/l TN and 1 mg/l TP. COD removal efficiency at Gutu was poor at 45%. The performance of Gutu and Nemanwa plants suffered from inappropriate design especially pond depth and short-circuiting. The duckweed died off in the November-January period, this being attributed to excessive levels of ammonia. It was concluded that the duckweed pond systems would offer a good alternative for managing and reusing wastewater at community level provided due regard is paid to appropriate design criteria.","Decentralised; Duckweed; Nutrients; Reuse; Sustainability; Wastewater treatment","Chemical oxygen demand; Nitrogen removal; Recycling; Sewage treatment; Structural design; Ponds; Wastewater treatment; ammonia; nitric oxide; nitrogen; phosphorus; potassium; Nitrogen; performance assessment; Phosphorus; Removal; stabilization pond; Sustainability; Wastewater treatment; bioremediation; nitrogen; performance assessment; phosphorus; sewage treatment; sustainability; wastewater; analytical parameters; chemical oxygen demand; chicken; community; conference paper; effluent; environmental sustainability; measurement; nutrient content; plant; pond; sewage; standard; waste component removal; waste water management; waste water recycling; waste water treatment plant; Zimbabwe; Zimbabwe; Animalia; Gallus gallus; Lemna",Conference Paper,Scopus

A specific location on a single-stage-to-orbit reusable launch vehicle was selected to develop loads and requirements needed to design prototype ARMOR TPS panels. The design loads include ascent and entry heating rate histories, pressures, acoustics, and accelerations. Additional TPS design issues were identified and discussed. An iterative sizing procedure was used to size the ARMOR TPS panels for thermal and structural loads as part of an integrated TPS/cryogenic tank structural wall. The TPS panels were sized to maintain acceptable temperatures on the underlying structure and to operate under the design structural loading. Detailed creep analyses were also performed on critical components of the ARMOR TPS panels. A lightweight, thermally compliant TPS support system (TPSS) was designed to connect the TPS to the cryogenic tank structure. Four 18-inch-square ARMOR TPS panels were fabricated.

The trajectory is divided in regions where angle of attack (AOA)-alpha and bank angle-sigma are parameterized to allow for trajectory reshaping during the optimization of surfaces sizing. The aero surfaces parameters used in the optimization are canted fin area and incidence angle, and flap area. Usually, the entry portion of the trajectory is designed to yield maximized downrange subject to structural load and aero-thermal constraints. In this paper, the trajectory optimization and aero surfaces sizing are combined in new formulation. That is to minimize the aero surfaces weight while maintaining the optimum performance.

Panel flutter is a self-excited aeroelastic vibration. The unsteady aerodynamic theory used in this study is the first- and second-order piston theory. The analysis capability is incorporated into a commercial finite element code with the goal of providing a useful tool for aerospace engineers -MSC/MARC [Ref.6]. The capability consists of three parts: linear flutter analysis, linear flutter analysis with arbitrary flow direction, and nonlinear hypersonic flutter analysis. Structural nonlinearities are not considered. The current paper covers both panel flutter analysis tool development as well as parametric panel flutter study of a specific metallic TPS configuration. The resulting analytical tool was used to analyze a metallic TPS being built for the X-33 experimental vehicle. The results show that nonlinear, hypersonic aerodynamic terms were found to have an insignificant effect on the panel flutter predictions for the X-33 TPS. The honeycomb sandwich that comprises most of the outer surface of the X-33 TPS panel was found to have large margins of safety for panel flutter for all flight conditions.

This work addresses two topics. The first topic concerns modeling and analysis methods used for stiffened panel optimization. In particular, the use of PANDA2 program for preliminary design, and the effect of different analysis and modeling choices in PANDA2 on optimum design are investigated. The second topic is comparison of weight efficiency of different stiffening concepts for a liquid hydrogen tank structure design. Optimized metallic and composite designs and their failure modes and margins are compared. Sensitivity to geometric imperfections is also studied. © 2000 by Satchi Venkataraman.",,"Analysis and modeling; Conceptual design phase; Geometric imperfection; Liquid hydrogen tanks; Model and analysis; Preliminary design; Reusable launch vehicles; Structural concept; Conceptual design; Launching; Liquefied gases; Reusability; Reusable rockets; Structural dynamics; Structural panels; Tanks (containers); Optimization",Conference Paper,Scopus

The views demonstrate the research process, the knowledge acquisition process and the recovery structure of the knowledge system. The described knowledge system should provide the possibility to reuse construction knowledge locked in documents. The documents will be classified using text analysing methods combined with clustering techniques. A lexicon which includes important parts of knowledge like construction key words, synonyms etc. for the specific domain of the building process will be combined with a document class structure and project class structure. During the process of general text analyses the lexicon will be completed with the frequency of words structured in different clusters of the building process. The knowledge system built up, will be a long-term storage of project experiences for the building industry.",,"Engineering research; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Project management; Reusability; Structural analysis; Lexicon; Project knowledge; Civil engineering",Conference Paper,Scopus

The pay load capability for each configuration is 176,000 Ibs launched due east into a 220 nautical mile circular orbit. This capability was chosen so as to be comparable to the payload capability of the Shuttle derived Magnum expendable heavy lift launch vehicle concept characterized by NASA in 1999. In the first option presented, a reusable, winged stage is used to boost a parallel burn, expendable core stage to LEO. For the second option, both the booster and orbiter are winged, reusable stages. The third option differs from second only in the fuel type used by the booster stage. The fourth configuration differs in that the winged, reusable orbiter utilizes an expendable payload shroud, rather than an internal payload bay. Its forward shroud is mounted to the orbiter s nose structure via a special structural attachment. Design trades investigated include reusability, propellant selection, engine choice, and booster separation condition, among others. Results indicate that a heavy lift Earth-to-Orbit strategy should consider using a shared reusable booster. The booster should be a common component of another two-stage-to-orbit launch system, to boost smaller core stages. This would allow recouping the boosters initial nonrecurring costs across a larger number of missions and programs. © The Boeing Company, all rights reserved.",,"Aerospace vehicles; Communication satellites; Launch vehicles; NASA; Orbits; Propulsion; Reusability; Rockets; Booster separation; Earth to orbits; Heavy-lift launch vehicles; Low earth orbits; Non-recurring costs; Payload capabilities; Reusable boosters; Two stage to orbits; Boosters (rocket)",Conference Paper,Scopus

The program was required to provide an accurate high-temperature model of the nozzle for incorporation into the engine system structural dynamics model for loads calculation; this model is significantly different from the ambient case due to the large decrease in composite material properties attributable to heating. The modal test was enabled by piggybacking onto a hot-fire test of the nozzle at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and tracking the natural frequencies as they decreased. A series of high-fidelity modal tests and finite element model correlation of the nozzle in a free-free configuration was initially performed. This model was then attached to a modal test-verified model of the engine hot-fire test stand and the ambient system mode shapes identified. A reduced set of accelerometers was then attached to the nozzle, the engine fired full duration, and the frequency peaks corresponding to the ambient nozzle modes individually isolated and tracked. To update the finite element model of the nozzle to these frequency curves, a multiplicative factor was applied to the rate of decline of the composite material property versus temperature table. This new property table was used to create high-temperature nozzle models corresponding to 10-sec engine operation increments and tied into the engine system model for loads determination. © 2000 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and, Astronautics, Inc.",,"Composite materials; Computer software reusability; Engines; Modal analysis; NASA; Reusability; Rocket nozzles; Rockets; Software testing; Space flight; Structural dynamics; Engine operations; Frequency curve; High temperature; Model correlation; Multiplicative factors; Reusable launch vehicles; Structural dynamics models; Temperature dependent; Finite element method",Conference Paper,Scopus

Laboratory tests were conducted to investigate the geotechnical properties of the Newark Harbor dredged sediments stabilized with portland cement. The material properties and strength characteristics were investigated using soil characterization, California Bearing Ratio, unconfined compression, unconsolidated undrained and consolidated undrained triaxial compression, and resilient modulus tests. Currently, portland cement stabilized dredged material is being placed as a subgrade layer for a future parking lot. Cone penetration testing was conducted on the material to evaluate the in-situ density of the deeper, compacted layers. Nuclear density tests were also conducted to verify compaction of the material. Correlations between the two in situ tests were developed to analyze the two-meter-deep structural fill.","Beneficial reuse; Cone penetration; Dredged sediments; Laboratory tests; Newark harbor; Nuclear density test; Subgrade","Building materials; Compression testing; Consolidation; Dredging; Portland cement; Ports and harbors; Sediments; Soil mechanics; Soil testing; Cone penetration testing; Dredged sediments; Nuclear density testing; Geotechnical engineering",Article,Scopus
