7,"Bertin, I; Mesnil, R; Jaeger, JM; Feraille, A; Le Roy, R",A BIM-Based Framework and Databank for Reusing Load-Bearing Structural Elements,Article,,"In a context of intense environmental pressure where the construction sector has the greatest impact on several indicators, the reuse of load-bearing elements is the most promising by avoiding the production of waste, preserving natural resources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by decreasing embodied energy. This study proposes a methodology based on a chain of tools to enable structural engineers to anticipate future reuse. This methodology describes the design of reversible assemblies, the addition of complementary information in the building information modeling (BIM), reinforced traceability, and the development of a material bank. At the same time, controlling the environmental impacts of reuse is planned by carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) at all stages of the project. Two scenarios for reuse design are applied with the toolchain proposed. A. design from a stock scenario, which leads to 100% of elements being reused, using only elements from stock. B. design with a stock scenario, which seeks to integrate as many reused elements available in the stock as possible. The case study of a high-rise building deconstructed to rebuild a medium-rise building demonstrated that the developed toolchain allowed the inclusion of all reuse elements in a new structural calculation model.",10.3390/su12083147,0.0

To realize this framework, a topology architecture model has been developed to integrate the configuration design and geometric modeling knowledge as well as the static and dynamic evaluation knowledge of machine tools with a specific topology architecture type; an analysis feature model is proposed for the integration between commercial CAD and CAE software, in which analysis features can be automatically converted to a script code for finite element analysis (FEA) through feature mapping. Based on the topology architecture model and feature-based CAD/CAE integration methodology, a two-stage design optimization process is proposed to perform the conceptual structural design of machine tools. In the first stage, the principal parameters which critically affect the performance of an entire machine are determined; then, the static and dynamic stiffness matching designs are performed to obtain the reasonable stiffness and weight of each structural part and functional component based on the stiffness model and dynamic model. In the second stage, the arrangement of ribs is determined by inferring the design knowledge; FEA is used to evaluate the performances of structural parts, and the response surface method (RSM) is applied to optimize the structural parameters to approach the stiffness and mass close to the allocated values obtained from the first stage. Re-design of a four-axis horizontal machining center with a box-in-box architecture was carried out to illustrate the design procedure in detail and to verify the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed framework. By applying the proposed framework, the total weight of the entire machine is minimized while sufficient stiffness is maintained. The results also show that the proposed framework facilitates the conceptual structural design and optimization process of machine tools.",10.1007/s00170-016-9721-y,0.0

In the field of construction safety risk management, in the face of a loose, chaotic, and huge information environments, how to design an efficient construction safety risk management decision support method has long been the focus of academic research. An effective approach to safety management is to structuralize safety risk knowledge, then identify and reuse it, and establish a scientific and systematic construction safety risk management decision system. Based on ontology and improved case-based reasoning (CBR) methods, this paper proposes a decision-making approach for construction safety risk management in which the reasoning process is improved by integrating a similarity algorithm and correlation algorithm. Compared to the traditional CBR approach in which only the similarity of information is considered, this method can avoid missing important correlated information by making inferences from multiple sources of information. Finally, the method is applied to the safety risks of subway construction for verification to show that the method is effective and easy to implement.",10.3390/ijerph17113928,0.0

However, in the context of adaptively reused buildings converted from historic buildings, how each performance aspect affects users' perception is missing. To explore the design concerns needed to be considered related to the performance of adaptively reused buildings from user's perspective, this paper proposed a framework to examine the effect of performance of adaptively reused buildings on users' satisfaction and behavior using structural equation modeling. A total of 608 valid face-toface interview questionnaires were collected at a school building converted from an abandoned industrial building. The empirical conclusions are as follows: (1) Building performance (including indoor environment quality, interior design, building services, and authenticity) all exerted a significant positive correlation with the learning behavior of students, among which indoor environment quality is the most critical factor affecting learning behavior of students. (2) Students' satisfaction is positively affected by the building performance (including indoor environment quality, interior design, building services, and authenticity), among which authenticity has the greatest effect on students' satisfaction. (3) The correlation between satisfaction and learning behavior of students is significant and positive. (4) Considering the mediator impact, authenticity indirectly affects learning behavior through satisfaction, while students' satisfaction has a partially mediating effect between the other three performance aspects and learning behavior. This paper provides a framework for assessing the performance of adaptively reused buildings and gives practical strategies for the improvement of users' satisfaction and behavior in similar projects.",10.1155/2022/1339133,0.0

In the perspective of reusing learning materials, we could do the same (reuse) also with concept maps. Unfortunately concepts maps are hard to compare in an educational setting, as most of the algorithms applied to this task work mainly on structural similarity, and may take into limited account pedagogical issues. In this work, we consider some measures that take into consideration both structural and didactic aspects of the concept maps, such as the prerequisite relation and the commonality of concepts, and present a framework that allows teacher to draw and/or compare her concept map with maps proposed by other teachers, in order to highlight common pedagogical aspects.",,

European Union legislators have taken part in this debate by publishing Directive 2018/851 to monitor the FW reduction goals, according to the waste hierarchical pyramid approach. At present, there are several proposed FW hierarchical pyramids, but these do not regard the associations between the level of waste-tackling strategies and social innovation (SI) models. Thus, the paper aims to build a hierarchical pyramid that considers, for each step of the food-supply chain and each level of the pyramid, all the FW social innovation models. A qualitative analysis of academic studies, institutional documents, and specific projects has been conducted. The results confirm the gap in the scientific literature and the lack of a systematic classification of SI activities to reduce FW. Furthermore, current SI practices are actually more focused on the human reuse of FW than on prevention, whereas SI models based on prevention might return the FWL issue to its systematic dimension. This information will help policymakers to reconsider the structural causes of FW inside the agro-food system, and not only its final consequences.",10.3390/su13094661,0.0

The circular economy is an effective alternative to the linear economic model inspired by natural metabolisms and the circular use of resources. This research explores how innovative strategies can be integrated for evaluating local urban and industrial wastes into sustainable building materials. A literature review is conducted focusing on circular design strategies, re-use, recycle, and waste transformation processes. Then, a methodology for the selection of upcycled and re-used building materials is developed based on Ashby's method. A total of thirty-five types of partition walls, which include plastic, wood, paper, steel, aluminium, and agricultural wastes, are evaluated using a multi-criteria decision aid (M-MACBETH). Among these solutions, ten types of walls show high-performance thermal and sound isolation, fourteen types are effective for coating, and two exhibit structural reliability.

145,"Al-Obaidy, M; Courard, L; Attia, S",A Parametric Approach to Optimizing Building Construction Systems and Carbon Footprint: A Case Study Inspired by Circularity Principles,Article,,"There is a global call for a paradigm shift in the construction industry towards carbon neutrality, but a scant effort has been madein practice, especially concerning circularity. This paper helps bridge the gap by introducing a parametric approach to optimize sustainable construction design. The methodology was tested on a newly constructed office building, inspired by circularity principles, in Westerlo, Belgium. The methodology consists of parametric construction-typological analysis, automated through One Click LCA software (Life Cycle Assessment) and Microsoft Excel with 21 alternate designs and 630 iterations. The parametric variations involved three key performance indicators: construction system, materials' environmental impact, and materials; reuse of content. The environmental effects of both construction systems (i.e., structural system, foundation type, materials, and envelope details) and reused building materials content (i.e.,) were evaluated by the parametric analysis for four construction systems scenarios. Environmental impact analysis for timber, steel, concrete, and hybrid construction systems was conducted, following ISO 14040 and CEN/TC 350 standards. The focus of the whole life cycle assessment was mainly on carbon neutrality. Results indicate that using local biosourced materials, including timber, can remarkably reduce buildings' environmental impact. The sensitivity analysis results provide hard evidence that the construction material's weight, materials reuse potential, and construction dismantling ability are the most influential factors in carbon-neutral buildings. This paper should improve professionals' understanding of the impact of different structural systems choices and inform building designers about the circularity potential, and carbon footprint of construction technologies.",10.3390/su14063370,0.0
238,"Cheng, JC",A Web Service Framework for Measuring and Monitoring Environmental and Carbon Footprint in Construction Supply Chains,Proceedings Paper,,"There is increasing demand for the measurement and accounting of the environmental and carbon footprint produced by corporate companies. In construction processes, environmental impacts accumulate along supply chains from raw material extraction, manufacturing, distribution, installation, maintenance, to demolition and disposal. The calculation of the environmental and carbon footprint of a construction project considers not only the emissions from contractors on site, but also those from the participating members along the supply chains. However, construction supply chains are characterized by their high fragmentation. It is not an easy task to measure and collect loosely distributed footprint data among numerous supply chain members. In addition, due to the project-based temporary nature of construction supply chains, it is unlikely for project participants to work together long enough on a project to build enough trust and to share information willingly. Therefore, a flexible, secure, and scalable support system is needed to measure and manage environmental and carbon footprint data in construction supply chains. This paper presents a web service collaborative framework for measuring, monitoring, and integrating environmental and carbon footprint data in construction supply chains. Web services technology is used because its plug-and-play capability allows flexible and quick system reconfiguration, which is desirable for communication and collaboration in construction supply chains. In the framework, each process element and footprint calculation is represented and delivered as individual web service units, which can be reused and integrated over standard web service protocols. This paper also presents an illustrative example to demonstrate the implementation of the web service framework. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.proeng.2011.07.016,0.0
239,"Marir, F; Alshawi, M",A case-based design brief development and design plans generation for construction projects,Proceedings Paper,,"This paper presents CBDBrief system, which uses case-based reasoning (CBR) technology to address the problem of the design brief development and the dynamic generation of design plans. The client's design brief is a key business process in construction industry. In spite of the widely recognised concept in determining the value of a construction project, the brief remains an under-researched area as far as IT is concerned, and also the conventional process of briefing does not reflect the requirement changes of the client. This is due to the fact that the brief task is highly complex and design tasks are wicked problems and therefore are not accessible to structured methodologies or model-based problem solving. The complexity and the uncertainty that characterise these processes make them an ideal domain for case-based reasoning. CBDBrief proposes an alternative model for developing design brief which promote collaborative working between the client, designer and the builder by reusing records of successes and failures of previous construction stored in an integrated object database. To tackle the complexity of brief cases, CBDBrief adopts the decomposition of cases into a sensible hierarchy of sub-cases whilst ensuring that sub-cases from different buildings can be sensibly recomposed to produce novel designs plans. Also, CBDBrief introduces cases version concept to keep track of the participants' decisions and to reflect the client organisations state of dynamic changes and allow intermediate situation to be retrieved and amended as the brief, design and building unfold. Such a system will significantly shorten the design process by bridging the gap between the brief and the detailed design stages. It is expected that the project will break new ground in a most difficult area to manage i.e. the brief-design area, and will be the nucleus for future specifications and developments of IT systems in this field.",,

Studying, reusing, sharing and integrating geo-analysis models can help researchers solve complicated and synthetic geo-problems with interdisciplinary knowledge, especially for researchers who collaborate with each other to build virtual geographic environments (VGEs). While the integration frameworks of geo-analysis models could permit their practical use, it is essential for model users to prepare data according to the specific requirements of the different geo-analysis models. Model users should invest adequate effort and time into preparing such model data, particularly when employing multi-disciplinary geo-analysis models. This paper proposed a data description model, the Universal Data eXchange (UDX) model that can reduce the effort and difficulties of model data preparation and pre-processing for model users. With the UDX model, researchers from interdiscipline can build a collaborative workspace in VGEs more conveniently. A hierarchical structure was employed in the UDX model for the flexible description of heterogeneous model data, and a set of basic data node types was designed to provide a relatively stable organization method for the various data contents. In the UDX model, the structural format data (e.g., the Shapefile and NetCDF data) and the flexible plain text data content can be described in a uniform way. In addition, model data information can be completely and unambiguously described with the items in the attachment libraries (e.g., unit and dimension library, semantic library, spatial reference library, and data description template library). Furthermore, two different model integration case studies were conducted to prove that various data processing methods and efforts can be accumulated and organized with the designed UDX data processing library.",10.1007/s12665-015-4270-5,0.0

This paper proposes a feature-based fixture design methodology in which previous fixture design cases and design rules are described in association with features and thus the design knowledge is integrated with geometric information of aircraft structural parts, which are the main concern of this project. In this methodology, machining features of the structural parts and their associated attributes are identified by feature recognition technique from the 3 dimensional (3D) part models defined based on model-based definition (MBD) technique. The feature-based part information models are then established and are used to retrieve previous fixture design cases and design rules stored in the knowledge base. Fixture designers will choose the appropriate retrieved design cases as the starting point for new fixture design or use previous designs to assess his/her current design. In this way the process of new fixture design can be improved. In the current stage of the research, a prototype feature-based fixture design system based on CATIA for the manufacturing of aircraft structural parts has been developed and used by a large airplane manufacturer.

As growing quantities of the three-dimensional process models are gradually applied, reusing the embedded manufacturing information in process models with less time and lower cost attracts a lot of attention. In this paper, a new flexible method is presented to reuse the existing process information based on retrieval of the similar machining feature. First, the three-level organization model is introduced to represent the process information; the machining feature which is seen as the parent layer carries the corresponding manufacturing information. To ensure accurately that the process information are obtained, the associated mechanism between the machining feature and process information is created. Second, an eight-node representation scheme is designed to represent the similar machining feature having same variations in topology and geometry. For accelerating similar feature retrieval, the extension-attributed adjacency graph and the topological relationship of the machining feature faces are built. Finally, some aircraft structural parts are utilized in the developed prototype module to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. This method can be used as the basis for accumulation of the process information; it can promote the development and application of the intelligent process planning.",10.1007/s00170-017-0131-6,0.0

This is a largely novel idea that is under-explored. A structured and generalized framework is presented to address and evaluate this idea. Validation of the efficacy of the framework is based on functional demonstration for a particularly compelling waste stream opportunity presented by the large number of discarded bicycle frames in many world economies. Key imped-iments include but are not limited to, efficient solutions to materials disassembly, sorting, structural properties assessment, markets, and re-assembly designs. Detailed analysis of modular structural truss assemblies from bicycle frames helps to demonstrate the solution steps included in the framework. In particular, the functional demonstration of the research concepts validates the feasibility of adaptively reusing bicycle frames into a modular assembly with a maximum load capacity of 3.6 kPa. The methodology presented can be used to add value to specific waste streams, contribute to reducing environmental impacts, and serve as a model for other adaptive reuse applications beyond the structural design context. The findings point to implications for product stewardship, as well as design for disassembly, and support future project development plans for policymakers. Barriers addressed by this research include those related to structural competency, lifecycle optimization, and economic feasibility.

It is difficult for researchers and computer-aided systems to share and reuse different assembly knowledge quickly and accurately, leading to inefficient and inaccurate assembly process planning. To integrate and structurally represent the assembly design knowledge, assembly simulation knowledge and assembly process knowledge of microdevice, this paper proposes a hierarchical assembly knowledge representation framework and develops a microdevice assembly ontology. There are four layers in the framework, including the organizational structure, the structural relationship, the assembly accuracy, and the process characteristics. The assembly design knowledge that is integrated involves the basic properties of the assembly object as well as the spatial, mating, and assembly relationship, etc. Assembly simulation knowledge refers to the permissible range of assembly force and contact force. Knowledge of assembly processes comprises assembly sequence and operating method of the part. The microdevice assembly ontology is developed based on METHONTOLOGY, and implemented with Prote ' ge '. The corresponding SWRL rules have been established to inference the implicit knowledge in assembly design.

Inheritance can achieve rapid design by reusing existing design knowledge, while innovation can realize innovative design by developing creative ideas and concepts. Thus, an ideal conceptual design model should administer to the implementation of inheritance and innovation. Considering rational design domains and mapping relations is beneficial to knowledge representation and inheritance. According with the thinking process of humans it is propitious to human intervention and innovation. To meet these requirements, this article proposes a hierarchical functional solving framework with hybrid mappings. In this framework, there are four design domains including function, working principle, behaviour and structure. The reasoning process of product function design consists of four mapping patterns, which are solving mapping pattern, reformulation mapping pattern, decomposition mapping pattern and derivative mapping pattern, totalling 15 basic mapping relations. The evolutionary logic of these mapping relations is developed in this article. In addition, the flow of the solving process from each design domain is established. The procedure in applying the proposed framework to the conceptual design is presented subsequently. Moreover, several embodiment strategies ensuring the effectiveness of identified design solutions are also proposed, including performance match analysis, behavioural compatibility analysis and structural compatibility analysis.

In addition, there are many different types of mitigation measures, from supply-side investment solutions to demand-side efficiency improvements, which may interact, risking double-counting of abatement potentials. This paper presents a novel, transparent methodology for building a marginal abatement cost curve that allows abatement costs and potentials to be compared. This curve improves over existing methods as it allows for abatement measures to be pursued in parallel, takes into account the interplay between abatement measures and captures data on cost uncertainty. The method is applied to build the first bottom-up marginal abatement cost curve for greater material efficiency steel use in the UK. This curve is demonstrated via four material efficiency measures which do not require large changes in final uses of products: reusing steel beams in construction, specifying optimal lightweight beams in construction, choosing smaller cars and specifying high strength steel car bodies. The results show that these strategies could reduce UK steel demand and associated global emissions by approximately 12%. 17% of this potential would be viable at the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) 2030 carbon price for policy appraisal (79 pound/ t CO2) taking into account emissions savings associated with steel demand only. Once use-phase emissions savings are taken into account this share increases to 60%. These results can be traced directly back to underlying assumptions regarding costs and emissions allocations.",,

62,"Griffin, CT; Douville, E; Thompson, B; Hoffman, M",A multi-performance comparison of long-span structural systems,Proceedings Paper,,"When a building requires a long span, especially on the ground floor of a multistory building, the long span often determines the structural system used early in the design process without any other consideration. Commercial and residential buildings are responsible for roughly 40% of all carbon emissions and energy use, more than any other sector in the USA. Moreover, this excludes the significant energy and emissions required to extract, process, transport and assemble building components. Globally, the production of cement alone accounts for 4% of carbon dioxide emissions. Consequently, reducing the environmental impact of building construction and operations is critical to address interrelated issues such as global climate change. The role of structural systems in the overall performance of a building has been largely neglected. Very little consideration is given to other ways the structure could contribute to improving sustainable outcomes. This is in spite of the fact that the structure of a typical office building contributes roughly one-quarter of the total embodied energy and is, at the very least, the armature for all other building systems. Existing research into the embodied energy of structural systems focuses on hypothetical office buildings with uniform structural layouts, a range of comparable, existing office buildings or housing without comparing or accounting for the long spans. Like all other aspects of a building, the structural system needs to be understood in terms of wide range of sustainability issues: embodied energy, operational energy, longevity and reuse. If structural systems could be left exposed without additional finishes as well as be configured to provide a higher level of thermal comfort, more daylight and acoustic isolation, this could significantly reduce the operational energy and the initial materials required for new construction. These multi-performance structural systems, in contrast to high-performance structural materials that aim to only improve structural properties, offer considerable and largely untapped opportunities to improve new and existing buildings while potentially lowering construction costs. Using a five-story, 2,500 square-meter (27,000 square-foot) classroom building with 24.4 meters by 30.5 meters (80 feet by 100 feet) auditorium on the ground floor as a case study currently in design at Oregon State University, the multi-performance criteria for three long span systems, including steel, concrete and wood, are compared. These criteria include embodied energy and carbon, structural and spatial properties, acoustical properties, fire protection and thermal properties. This paper argues that the most efficient structural solution may not be the best in terms of overall sustainability outcomes, and the selection of a structural system should be based on multi-performance criteria.",,

In small batch production such as machining aircraft structural parts, human experience is dominant in the process planning of those parts with great variability. Inferior planning of the machining process directly leads to low efficiency and quality, which has serious impact on the lead time of aircraft structural parts. To address these problems, different from the existing process knowledge reuse method by estimating the geometric similarity, a more reliable process planning method based on fuzzy comprehensive evaluation via historical machining data is proposed in this article. As long as machining resources are determined, a feature-based historical machining data model can be built, and the similarities between new machining features and the features in the database are estimated accordingly. Machining strategy, which contains tool path strategy and machining parameters, can then be identified according to the evaluation results of the similar features based on entropy weight method.

Moreover, its excellent strength-to-weight ratios, thermal insulating and acoustical properties make it useful for different kinds of applications in buildings, ranging from structural beams and frames, insulating envelopes, windows, door frames, to wall and flooring materials and furniture. Although wood is commonly classified as a sustainable material, its real sustainability depends on different issues: appropriate forest management, manufacturing methods and site assembly, distance required for transportation and use of glues. Wood has also good seismic performances due to its lightweight and even if timber elements are not able to have a ductile behavior, using steel connection allows to build dissipative structure, as well platform frame and X-LAM panels systems. Insulation properties are related to low thermal conductivity values. Furthermore, wooden elements can be used to minimize sound transmission and they can be employed as sustainable materials as several Life Cycle Assessment studies demonstrate. This review paper aims to analyze the structural, thermal, acoustical and environmental properties of wooden materials for building applications; other properties such as fire resistance and durability were also taken into account.

The total Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the End of Life (EoL) of products have to be defined in the early design phases too but, for industrial products that are not feasible to automatic production, they are hard issues. However, the EoL of products can be assessed by evaluating the disassembly of joints assembling the product, even when the production process is subject to an important contribute of workmanship. In this paper, a useful method is proposed to analyze the disassembly plant of products, in order to optimize the design process in the early preliminary phases. The method quantitatively evaluates a Disassembly Index that describes the attitude of a product to be disassembled. A case study describes the disassembly attitude of structural subassemblies of a sailboat. In order to test the applicability of the model described to both manual and automated disassembly, a further application of the method is proposed on a Computer CPU. As result, the model demonstrated good sensitiveness to the testing of products quite different for dimensions, number of components, manufacturing processes and, in all cases, it quantified the disassembly easiness with good relevance.",10.1080/23311916.2019.1609178,0.0
224,"Huang, GQ; Li, L; Chen, X",A tandem evolutionary algorithm for platform product customization,Article,,"The increasing demand for reduction in time to market has led to new product development methodologies focusing on reuse. Platform product customization emerges as a basic idea for avoiding designing a new product completely from scratch, but reusing a product platform instead Key dimensions of some modules of the platform can be stretched or shrunk while modules themselves can be swapped to formulate multiple product variants in a family according to specific customer requirements. This paper formulates such a problem of platform product customization as an optimization problem consistent, with the manufacturer's goal in the design of product variant(s) while satisfying customer requirements and design constraints. Optimal customization takes place at the levels of product structure and module parameters. A tandem evolutionary algorithm is proposed for identifying the optimal structural composition and the optimal parameters of the corresponding structure. The encoding schemes and genetic operators for structure and parameter optimization are designed, respectively. A case study of gantry crane customization is given to illustrate how the proposed evolutionary customization design method is used. The effectiveness of the method is also evaluated through a series of sensitivity analyses.",10.1115/1.2720883,0.0

After consumption, goods end-up in local waste streams and landfilled because of poorly developed waste management systems. This paper proposes a methodology to extend responsibility to exporting country manufacturers for indirect waste disposal in developing countries through imported goods. It establishes a functional relationship between the weight and volume of the imported goods and the local municipal solid waste stream derived from their consumption, by adapting the recycling concepts of by-product and co-product to the municipal solid waste stream derived from the household sector. A lexicon is formalized to conceptualize an extended-producer-responsibility information system operating at the global level between exporting and importing countries. This EPR system i) determines the recyclability, reusability and treatability attributes of imported goods based on their constitutive parts (primary package or product), as well as the material value as per the net value in the global waste market and final destination once consumed, ii) defines specific conditions regarding the goods' materials value and structural configuration of their constitutive parts for inclusion in Free-Trade Agreement clauses, and iii) checks for the fulfilment of these proposed conditions. The proposed methodology was validated with a case study on Panama. It was found that 24%(w/w)34.5%(v/v) of valued materials derived from goods imported in Panama through FTAs could be exported back to the country of origin, 18%(w/w)-2.8%(v/v) could be locally reused, and 58%(w/w)-62.5%(v/v) locally valorized.

To facilitate deconstruction and efficient reuse of steel components, an innovative connection system was proposed. This system adopts a 'Block Shear Connector (BSC)' that allows beam length to be standardised and suitable for a wide range of different sizes of the supporting members within the same planning grid. A beam-to-beam connection using BSCs was manufactured and tested to failure at the Heavy Structures Laboratory, University of Bradford. The BSC used was made from a standard universal column section and was bolted to the beams by using partial depth end plates. The experimental results presented in this paper provided the shear resistance, moment-rotation, failure behaviour, ease of demountability and the reusability of the steel components. Further parametric study was conducted to investigate some key parameters (steel strength, thickness of BSC web, thickness of BSC flange, initial bolt stress) that affecting the behaviour of the connections.

The method involves welding shear studs to the intact part of the web plate and encasing the end region in UHPC. This paper presents the findings of an experimental study on a full-scale girder aimed to assess the feasibility of rapid implementation of the repair. Reducing the construction complexities and time is critical in cases where access to the bridge is constrained or closing the bridge to traffic is not possible. To expedite and simplify repair construction, welded shear studs originally used to transfer loads to the UHPC cast were replaced with steel dowel rods. In place of conventional wooden formwork, a reusable flexible light-gauge sheet of steel was wrapped around the end. Installation of the shear connectors, installation of the form, and casting of the UHPC was completed by two workers within an eight-hour shift. The repaired girder was load tested after the UHPC gained a compressive strength of 96.5 MPa to demonstrate the adequacy of the repair for restoring the capacity of the intact girder end shortly after implementation. It is anticipated that this empirical data encourages the use of this repair technique to address the widespread problem of end corrosion in steel superstructures.",,

Italian School Infrastructure: Safety and Social Restoration,Article,,"The Italian school infrastructure has suffered in recent decades from an immobility that has generated critical issues and shortcomings in the management of structures, safety adjustments, and innovations in the architectural and pedagogical model. This type of stasis, due to the scarcity of resources on a national scale and the decrease in the birth rate of the country, has meant that the buildings are largely inadequate from both a regulatory and socio/pedagogical point of view, with a level of degradation that is leading to a progressive abandonment of several structures, generating further insecurity at the urban level. In Italy, the current health emergency (SARS-CoV-2), with the necessity of wider spaces for social distancing and less numerous classes, has further highlighted the strongly problematic nature of an extensive and often obsolete school building heritage, raising the need to reevaluate heritage in terms of safety, accessibility, economic impact, and, last but not least, social cohesion. The paper proposes an approach that starts from the analysis of regulations and data on a national scale related to the structural and formal conditions of school buildings, interpreting and evaluating their safety with a holistic approach, to then proceed to the definition of a design survey matrix able to classify the selected cases and give an interpretative reading that includes the vastest number of characterizing factors.

The study concludes that the main factors constraining water conservation include: backward technologies and processes; irrational industrial scale and composition and raw materials composition; as well as regional distribution. Based on 1980 data on the level of technology, technological progress, and water efficiency, the study uses the bottom-up modeling approach; the end-of-pipe water use analysis method; and the cost-benefit analysis method to establish the industrial water conservation potential analysis (IWCPA) model. Taking 2002 as the baseline year, the IWCPA is used to simulate and calculate water demand and water conservation potential of China's industries under different technology scenarios between 2003 and 2030. Based on the assessment of different technologies for individual sectors and across sectors, key priority technologies are proposed for five HWCS. Lastly, the paper, based on an uncertainty analysis of the parameters used in the model, talks about the impact of water pricing and other factors on future water demand and water conservation potential by industrial sectors. The paper shows that the demand for water by China's industrial sectors will experience sustained growth till 2020, and that this trend is unlikely to be reversed unless measures are taken to promote water conservation through upgrading technology and making industrial structural adjustments. The water conservation potential of key common technologies accounts for over 60% of water consumption by high-water-consuming sectors. The economic benefits from improving production processes are far greater than those from reuse or recycling technologies only. The current price of water is too low, and needs to be raised to at least 2.7 Yuan/ton in order to fully exploit the potential for industrial water conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Uncovering water transfer network can help improving water resource coordination development from the perspectiye of water-trade nexus. An integrated framework by uniting the interregional input-output (IRIO) analysis and social network analysis (SNA) in this study can estimate not only the scale and structure of water trade pattern, but also the topological characteristic of water transfer network of YREB. Results show that the rank of production-based virtual water volume was roughly in the order of middle, lower and upper reaches except Jiangsu, while the rank of consumption based virtual water volume was in the order of lower, middle and upper reaches. The provincial virtual water external dependence in YREB was not well consistent with the water resource endowment. Water transfer network was constructed on basis of the inter-provincial virtual water transfers between every two provinces inside YREB. Furthermore, the water transfer network assessment results illustrated the network structural form and revealed the network property and characteristics. Inside YREB, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and Jiangxi were predominant in the water transfer network (from degree centrality), while Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and Anhui acted as the important medium and bridge (from betweenness centrality). The AFAF sector (Agriculture, Forestry, Animal husbandry and Fishery) and Industry sector of Jiangxi, and the Industry sector of Hubei and Jiangsu were the critical exporters in the network. Jiangsu received large amounts of virtual water from many good hubs and also transferred much to many good authorities when acted as bagmen in the network. Some provinces received large virtual water flow but provided few to others, such as Shanghai, and the AFAF sectors of most provinces transferred much to others. Thus, the research results would help understand the regional responsibility transfer in the hidden network linkages of interprovincial and intersectoral virtual water flows. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Efficient material use through optimised cross-section design reduces construction material demand. Demountable steel-concrete composite floor systems are perceived as competitive when consisting of steel beams and large prefabricated concrete floor elements, with composite interaction achieved by demountable shear connectors. Compared to traditional monolithic floor systems, the demountable composite floor systems have an increased sensitivity to lateral-torsional buckling during execution, mostly because of unsymmetrical loading and the absence of rotational constraints in the execution phase. This increased sensitivity implies that the cross-section of the steel beam should not only be designed based on the required in-plane resistance, but should also maximise the out-of-plane resistance. The Energy method and Rayleigh-Ritz methods are combined to develop a prediction model for the critical bending moment of monosymmetrical web-tapered steel beams. The key cross-sectional dimensions and parameters that affect the in-plane and out-of-plane resistance are identified. An overarching strategy for the concurrent optimisation of the in-plane and out-of-plane resistance of monosymmetrical cross-sections is presented without compromising on material efficiency. The beneficial effects of the proposed optimisation strategy are quantified through a case study example.",,

The overwhelming majority of the existing validation approaches focuses on the internal validity of CCMs (e.g. consistency, bias), while there is a shortage of efficient approaches for assessing the external validity (e.g. applicability, reusability). The objective of this paper is to clarify the concepts and criteria, and to develop an approach for a systematic evaluation of the applicability of a given CCM to cases that were not considered at design time. The approach is adapted from the validation square approach (VSA). The adapted methodology (A-VSA) makes it possible to evaluate CCMs from (a) theoretical structural, (b) empirical structural, (c) theoretical performance, and (d) empirical performance dimensions. Altogether eight indicators are introduced that support the evaluation process. The effectiveness of the A-VSA was confirmed through a case study, in which a specific CCM is considered and the strategy of the A-VSA was operationalized with three completely different application cases. As evidenced by the results, the proposed A-VSA establishes a tight coupling among the enablers embraced by a CCM and the aspects of theoretical and empirical validation, which approves the approach to be an efficient tool for defining the range and/or the extent of applicability. The advantage of the A-VSA is that it offers a way to transfer qualitative applicability evaluation into quantitative applicability assessment, which allows the use of both subjective statements and mathematical modeling in applicability testing.

In this prospective, the following work analyze the potentiality (from technological, thermal and structural point of view) of a lightweight shelter skin composed by recycled skis, covered by a textile envelope coupled with thermal reflective multilayer insulation able to provide high-quality thermal comfort. This solution addresses different purposes: recycling high technology material, construction speed, lightness and low embodied energy. As skis are constituted by different layers of high-performances materials, that are also difficult to dismiss, their reuse reduce the CO2 emissions and the amount of wasted material. In collaboration with the University of Grenoble, some laboratory tests have been carried out in order to investigate the mechanical properties of skis and design durable and resistant structure. The morphology of proposed shelter comes from the archetype of the Mongolian Yurt, modelled and adapted to improve energetic performances: a detailed building model has been used to perform dynamic building energy simulation. The structure is composed by 130 pair of skis with different lengths and characterized by a circular basement (6 meters of diameter) divided in 24 concentric sectors that constitute the structural axis, where are located pillars and beams made by coupling different combinations of skis. Externally two orders of circular hoops help to absorb the loads coming from the covering, and between the pillars are placed two bracing elements. At the center of the circumference a steel pillar supports the flat-roof window. A real-scale prototype has been developed in order to verify the assumptions made during the design phases. The shelter is now built and used in a humanitarian mission in Guinea Bissau. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",10.1016/j.proeng.2017.04.271,0.0

The recent EGADI project involved the realization of two pilot project actions in a small Mediterranean island of Southern Italy (Island of Favignana) with,the goal to adapt the current MSW management system to the logic of the 3Rs approach (reduce, reuse & recycle). The actions concerned the installation of a water kiosk to reduce plastic waste production and a community composter to recover material from the organic fraction of MSW. Additionally, non-structural actions as a communication plan and an environmental education campaign were implemented with the intent of increasing public awareness on the addressed topics. In this context, the study was aimed to investigate the public perception and knowledge of islanders with reference to the two pilot actions before and after the implementation of such activities so as to provide guidance for optimizing the MSW management system of the island. A structured questionnaire was implemented and administered to the students of a secondary school and their parents before and after the implementation of the planned actions. The obtained data were processed by using descriptive statistics and Multiple Correspondent Analysis (MCA) in order to achieve a global view on the level of knowledge and public perception as well as to establish as a whole, the rate of satisfaction and the goodness of the project actions. The feedbacks on the implemented actions were critically discussed highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Some drawbacks were to be connected to the adopted communicative plan which resulted to be not so effective in reaching the target since its random character. Islanders perceived positively the new technologies implemented. The water kiosk was perceived positively if it only serves residents. Furthermore, islanders positively perceived the kerbside separate collection preferring at the same time the community composting as strategy for the management of the organic fraction, at least in the most densely populated areas. The social assessment that was conducted during the investigation provided guidance of the optimum MSW management system of the island. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The distribution profile was constructed with the material use data collected from thirteen high-rise office concrete buildings in Hong Kong. Our results indicate that the superstructure of an office building (i.e. it does not embrace foundation or basement), on average, had a footprint of 215.1 kg CO2/m(2). External walls and upper floor construction had the highest CO2 footprint, followed by suspended ceilings and finishes. These three elements altogether accounted for an average of 84.2% of the CO2 footprint associated with the superstructure. Furthermore, this study also evaluated the emissions reduction impacts of five different material use options over a 60-year lifespan. Among all the studied options, the most effective option is to maintain 15-30% of the existing structural and non-structural building elements as it can reduce the CO2 footprint by 17.3%. Diverting construction wastes to recycling can reduce the CO2 footprint by 5.9%. Reusing resources and importing regional materials can each only reduce the CO2 footprint by 3.2% and 3.1% respectively. In contrast, the CO2 footprint will be increased by 5% if off-site fabricated materials are used in facades, slabs and partition walls. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, for components that are designed to be welded, in which multiple functional requirements are satisfied by one single welded structure, the automation and simulation capabilities to evaluate welding-producibility and predict welding quality (geometrical deformation, weld bead geometrical quality, cracks, pores, etc) are limited. Besides the complexity of simulating all phenomena within the welding process, one of the main problems in welded integrated components is the existing coupling between welding quality metrics and product geometry. Welding quality can vary for every new product geometrical variant. Thus, there is a need of analyzing rapidly and virtually the interaction and sensitivity coefficients between design parameters and welding quality to predict welding producibility. This paper presents as a result an automated and interactive welding-producibility evaluation approach. This approach incorporates a data-based of welding-producibility criteria, as well as welding simulation and metamodel methods, which enable an interactive and automated evaluation of welding quality of a large number of product variants. The approach has been tested in an industrial use-case involving a multidisciplinary design process of aircraft components. The results from analyzing the welding-producibility of a set of design variants have been plotted together with the analysis results from other engineering disciplines resulting in an interactive tool built with parallel coordinate graphs. The approach proposed allows the generation and reuse of welding producibility information to perform analyses within a big spectrum of the design space in a rapid and interactive fashion, thus supporting designers on dealing with changes and taking fact-based decisions during the multidisciplinary design process.",10.1007/s12008-021-00775-z,0.0

Although many researchers and practitioners are in agreement about the potential applicability and benefit of BIM in construction, it is still unclear why BIM is adopted, and what factors enhance implementation of BIM. Thus, BIM acceptance and use remains a central concern of BIM research and practice. Therefore, we propose an acceptance model for BIM in construction organizations using structural equation modeling (SEM). The key components, including the BIM acceptance model (BAM), are identified through a literature review about technology acceptance-behavior related theories, and was then consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in the construction industry. Based on the components, a questionnaire was designed and sent out to workers in construction organizations (such as contractors, architects, construction managers, and engineers) in South Korea.

The BIM-based FM system must be able to support different use cases per user role and effectively extract information required by the use cases from various heterogeneous data sources. If the FM system's user perspective becomes structurally fixed when developing the system, the lack of expandability can cause problems for maintenance and reusability. BIM perspective definition (BPD) metadata helps increase expandability and system reusability because it supports system variability, which allows adding or changing the user perspective even after the system has been developed. The information to be dealt with differs according to the user's role, which also means that the data model, data conversion rules, and expression methods change per perspective. The perspective should be able to extract only the user-requested data from the heterogeneous system's data source and format it in the style demanded by the user. In order to solve such issues, we analyzed the practice of FM and the benefits of using BIM-based FM, and we proposed a BPD that supports data extraction and conversion and created a prototype.

The developed designs are the main deliverables exchanged and handed over. However, these deliverables do not include any explanation of design intentions or documentation of design decisions. Communication among parties and reuse of knowledge are hindered by the absent explanation of existing design. To overcome this deficiency, this paper proposes a methodology for digitally documenting design decisions, incorporating their intention and rationale. Architectural concepts and evaluation criteria are represented in the form of explanation tags as well as spatial and semantic constraints, which are assigned to the individual model elements and properties. Additionally, to document how design decisions fulfill owner requirements and regulatory documents, natural language processing (NLP) is employed to facilitate querying those documents and then the individual requirements are linked to specific elements, properties, and constraints.

The finite element models for the nonlinear inelastic analysis of coped beams, column-column connections and composite beams are developed based on nonlinear finite element analysis techniques using the commercial finite element program, ABAQUS. The behaviours for coped steel beams and composite beams are then compared with the corresponding experimental results. The finite element models are used to investigate the effects of material and geometric properties on the behaviour of demountable connections. The finite element models can efficiently predict the plastic damage in the coped steel beam used in beam-beam connections. It is demonstrated that the coped beam can be made demountable up to a load of about 50% of the ultimate load which is greater than typical service loads.

The average concentrations of total NACs in Qb samples (0.37 +/- 0.31 - 1.79 +/- 0.77 mu gm 3) were greater than 50% of those observed in the Qf samples (0.51 +/- 0.43-3.91 +/- 2.06 mu gm(3)), and the Qb-to- Qf mass ratios of individual NACs had a range of 0.02-2.71, indicating that the identified NACs might have substantial fractions remaining in the gas phase. In comparison to other sources, cookstove emissions from red oak or charcoal fuels did not exhibit unique NAC structural features but had distinct NAC composition. However, before identifying NAC sources by combining their structural and compositional information, the gas-particle partitioning behaviors of NACs should be further investigated. The average contributions of total NACs to the light absorption of organic matter at lambda = 365 nm (1.10 %-2.57 %) in Qf and Qb samples (10.7 %-21.0 %) are up to 10 times larger than their mass contributions (Q(f): 0.31 %-1.01 %; Q(b): 1.08 %3.31 %), so the identified NACs are mostly strong light absorbers. To explain more sample extract absorption, future research is needed to understand the chemical and optical properties of high-molecular-weight (e.g., molecular weight, MW > 500 Da) entities in particulate matter.",10.5194/acp-20-14077-2020,0.0

Despite a rapid growth of research interest in developing Circular Economy strategies for concrete, this has mostly focussed on technical and environmental issues at the material and product scale. Holistic approaches considering wider social and political aspects as well as system-scale perspectives have been relatively neglected. This article uses a narrative review to investigate three outstanding questions to help address this gap: how concrete's material, product and system scale attributes influence the interpretation of Circular Economy principles; how the full range of Circular Economy strategies can be implemented for concrete; and what the likely implementation issues will be when integrating different Circular Economy strategies (such as design for durability, component reuse and material recycling). From a product-scale perspective, it is argued that greater specificity is needed around the growing diversity of concrete materials and products in Circular Economy discourse their properties are often distinct and hence specific strategies are not necessarily universally applicable. At the same time, a solely product-centric Circular Economy perspective is insufficient for concrete, and only joint consideration of structural and systemic perspectives will yield satisfactory solutions. 'Soft' perspectives of social, political and legal aspects cannot be viewed simply as an added bonus, but are essential to reconciling the 'hard' issues of technical, environmental and economic aspects that dominate discussions. Whilst concrete can and should have a key role in a Circular Economy, its success will require more than just extensions of linear economy thinking.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.132486,0.0

Two scenarios were considered: a traditional structural steel frame or an all-wood mass timber design, utilizing engineered wood products for both gravity and lateral load resistance. The boundary of the quantitative analysis was cradle-to-grave with considerations taken to discuss end-of-life and material reuse scenarios. The TRACI methodology was followed to conduct a Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) analysis that translates building quantities to environmental impact indicators using the Athena Impact Estimator for Buildings Life Cycle analysis software tool and Athena's Life Cycle Inventory database. The results of the analysis show that mass timber buildings have an advantage with respect to several environmental impact categories, including eutrophication potential, human health particulate, and global warming potential where a 31% to 41% reduction was found from mass timber to steel designs, neglecting potential carbon sequestration benefits from the timber products. However, it was also found that the steel buildings have a lower impact with respect to the environmental impact categories of smog potential, acidification potential, and ozone depletion potential, where a 48% to 58% reduction was found from the steel to the mass timber building designs.",10.3390/su13063401,0.0

The growing popularity of Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology is based heavily on the perception that it can facilitate the sharing and reuse of information during a project's lifecycle. Although many researchers and practitioners are in agreement about the potential applicability and benefit of BIM in construction, it is still unclear why BIM is adopted, and what factors enhance the implementation of BIM. Thus, BIM acceptance and use remains a central concern of BIM research and practice. BIM was accepted in the United States earlier than in Korea, and BIM users are expected to have a higher maturity and positive perception about utilizing BIM depending on a lengthier utilization period. This means that the mechanism for achieving acceptance of BIM in Korea differs from the mechanism in the United States. Therefore, Korea's BIM acceptance model was compared to that in the United States using structural equation modeling. The key components, including the BIM acceptance model, were identified through a literature review of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and related theories and was consolidated by interviews and pilot studies with professionals in the construction industry. Based on these components, a questionnaire was designed and sent out to workers in construction organizations (such as contractors, architects, construction managers, engineers, and facility managers) in Korea and the United States. A total 164 completed questionnaires were retrieved. Structural equation modeling for hypothesis testing was conducted using commercially-available software. The results from this study can serve as a foundation for research looking into the organizational context to further BIM acceptance in the construction industry. The comparison of the mechanism and subsequent results will serve as a guideline for developing an acceptance strategy that is suitable for Korea.

From the perspective of embodied impacts, repurposing existing structures can reduce the amount of new materials that have to be extracted, manufactured, and installed. While the literature on energy efficiency retrofitting is relatively abundant, a smaller number of studies investigate the differences in whole-building embodied impacts of major renovations. This study presents an approach for conducting a whole-building life cycle assessment (LCA) on building renovation projects, suggests an approach for conducting comparative assessments between renovation and new construction, and demonstrates the approach on an adaptive reuse case study. The approach consists of comparing the full life cycle impacts of the existing building to the sum of the life cycle impacts of the components added in the renovation and the maintenance and replacement needs of the existing/reused components. The case study showed 53-75% reductions across 6 different environmental impact categories when the renovation was compared to a new construction scenario. The reuse of the structural and envelope components provided the majority of the reductions, as most of the renovation was of the interior components and finishes. The presented work can be used as a model for consistent LCAs on other renovation projects and to show designers, policy makers, and building owners the environmental benefits of adaptive reuse over new construction as a result of reduced need for new building materials.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2019.106218,0.0

However, there is still a lack of quantitative studies on the corresponding environmental benefits in this regard. In the present study, a life cycle assessment of a multi-storey residential reference building is carried out, comparing a flexible, reversible building design using a load-bearing steel structure and wooden ceiling elements to a conventional, monolithic design based on reinforced concrete. The assessment is carried out on a whole building level, including construction, operation, maintenance, and the end-of-life phase. Both building designs show similar results for a regular life cycle of 60 years without major refurbishment (13 and 14.5 kg CO2-eq/m(2) per operational year). When longer building lifetimes are considered, the environmental impact of the reference building per operational year decreases significantly. In this context, flexible building design is advantageous as it facilitates the refurbishment of buildings, while monolithic building design often leads to premature demolition due to low adaptability. Further advantages of reversible building design include the increased potential of materials to be recirculated at the end-of-life stage of a building and in the potential reuse of structural elements. This study shows that 14% of the embodied greenhouse gas emissions of the flexible building can be avoided if the foundation, load-bearing structure and ceiling elements are kept in place for a subsequent building. Such direct reuse leads to a substantially higher environmental value retention than recycling of the same materials.",10.1016/j.buildenv.2022.109409,0.0
80,"Griffin, CT; Reed, B; Hsu, S",Comparing the embodied energy of structural systems in buildings,Proceedings Paper,,"There are a number of factors that typically influence the selection of a structural system including code, cost, construction schedule and site constraints. As sustainability increasingly becomes an important goal during the design process, the role of structure in the overall sustainability of a building will need to be considered in terms of embodied energy, building longevity, reuse and deconstruction. The structure of a typical office building contributes roughly one-third to one-quarter of the total embodied energy and double the amount contributed by interior finishes. Consequently, the structure of a building should be a primary target for reducing the embodied energy of a building. While there has been much research on the embodied energy of structural materials, there has been less research into comparing the embodied energy of structural systems. Life-cycle analysis (LCA) tools exist to calculate the embodied energy of a proposed structural system during the early stages of the design process. However, the over simplified nature of these tools can provide misleading conclusions about which structural materials and systems will have the lowest environmental impact. To allow architects and engineers to consider issues of sustainability in the design and selection of a structural system, a transparent and easily understood metric for comparing the embodied energy of structural systems is required. In order to better understand the relationship between structural systems and embodied energy, this paper examines the embodied energy of materials used in typical steel and reinforced concrete structural systems by calculating the amount of material needed for different systems and the embodied energy of selected bay sizes. This method accounts for the varying size and amount of material needed for different spans and columns sizes. By using bay sizes, alternative structural systems are more easily compared to one another. Finally, a 4-story laboratory building, in design at the University of Oregon in Eugene, Oregon, was used as a case study to test the use of bay sizes as a comparative tool. Using schematic plans furnished by the architects to identify the bay sizes used in the building, a one-way concrete slab and beam or one-way joist slab proved to be the structural systems with the lowest embodied energy (both approximately 5,000 GJ).",,

As a result of the evaluation of these studies, the lack of analysis studies based on a certain algorithm was determined. In this context, in this study, existing models are evaluated in order to contribute to future studies in the context of adaptability. This study is presented as a guide for new studies in the context of adaptability. Design/methodology/approach In the study, first of all, the change of the concept of adaptability in the historical process was investigated by literature review from 1958 to the present. Then, a comparative analysis of the existing adaptability models used in architecture between the years 2007-2020 was made in the context of the main and sub-criteria obtained in the literature research. Findings In the study, the concept of adaptability, the definition of building adaptability and the analysis of adaptability models were examined and findings were obtained under three main headings. The definition of adaptability takes place in the literature on a multidisciplinary scale. In the definition of adaptability, it should cover not only structural but also functional, economic, technological and performance-oriented strategies applied to structures. Although the theories examined within the scope of building adaptability are seen as a guide for future studies, they should be supported by examples that can be applied in a global context. In the study, 7 adaptability models determined by a semi-systematic literature review were analyzed. The matrices of the models based on the adaptability sub-criteria are discussed in the context of scenario, physical life, openness, physical use, barriers and obsolescence. The data obtained is a guide for the models to be used in the future within the scope of adaptability.

Specifically, two columns and three Beams of a four-story steel-framed building were instrumented prior to delivery to the construction site using a wireless sensor network. Data were recorded for 48 days, while the structure was erected and the concrete deck poured, up to fireproofing the building. The data were analyzed considering dead load force effects during various construction phases, impacts, and temperatures. The analysis revealed high variations in temperature throughout the structure and consequently significant temperature-induced stresses as well as greater magnitudes of flexural stress in columns than expected. As a result, the recorded stresses differed by 1-120 MPa (0-18 ksi) compared to the theoretically predicted stresses. Yet, the maximum measured stress [160 MPa (23.2 ksi)] was only 46% of the nominal yield strength. Measured stresses were also used to calculate member forces, and the combined member forces resulted in a maximum of 55% of the yield limit.

Structural work and foundations represent the majority of the embodied energy of a building. The research effort is therefore focused on the structural elements. Reuse is here defined as the reuse of an element without transformation, unlike recycling which induces a new industrial cycle. It is therefore about reducing the consumption of materials and lowering GHG emissions. Today, it is impossible in France to reuse structures because of responsibilities, insurance and lack of traceability. How to make possible the reuse of structural components in order to reach a low carbon building?

The main actions leading towards a CE have been identified as the 3R principles of reduce, reuse, and recycle. However, understanding is lacking regarding how the adoption of CE using the 3R principles generates value and revenue in a business context. Thus, this study structurally examines business models used by CE-driven firms utilizing the fundamental business model components of value proposition, value creation/delivery, and value capture. By developing a detailed framework of business model components, acknowledging the particular features of CE implementation, and conducting a multiple-case study combining the business model approach with the 3R principles, this study analyzes feasible CE business models from multiple industries in Europe, the US, and China. The following five research propositions are derived from the findings of the explorative case analysis: 1) the cost-efficiency of circular operations is the key proponent to successful CE business, 2) take-back services enable the acquisition of particular wastes as resources, but they need to be incentivized through reductions in customers' total waste management costs, 3) circular business models require the focal firm to separately manage multiple positions in the value chain, 4) the take-back system for gaining value through CE can be implemented successfully in multiple ways, and 5) recycling is easier to implement than reducing or reusing due to a smaller impact on the business. These propositions contribute to the circular business model literature by showing how economic value is generated by CE initiatives and providing foundations for theory-testing future research. The propositions also provide guidance for policymakers and managers on supporting and implementing circular business. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.072,0.0

This urban expansion poses a serious threat to historic properties when people opt to move away leaving behind their heritage. The adaptive reuse of heritage is considered to be a dominant strategy for handling this issue bypassing demolition of heritage properties. However, the adaptive reuse cannot only consider the preservation of the heritage as the structural retrofit or functional revitalization but rather it needs to enunciate the image and the creative ideation that reflect upon the future of heritage. Consequently, this paper aims to examine the role of branding as an innovative source of ideation in the implication of adaptive reuse on heritage. In this regards, the case study of Zalando outlet store in Berlin is selected, which is an old building situated in the commercial district of the city in a wide range of styles and heritage buildings from the middle ages. This research uses semi-structured interviews to examine the significance of Brand making in a successful adaptive reuse process.

These patterns capture coherent solutions to known problems that can be reused in concept design with the aim to save modeling effort. Since they are based on solution-neutral functions, they also offer multiple potential solutions at once. The new behavior simulation library and solution patterns are demonstrated in this paper using a 3D printer case study with two different kinematic solutions. (C) 2016 The Authors.

The use of an easily disassembled and lightweight steel structure coupled with dry-layered technologies allows a tailor-made envelope design, ensuring high thermal comfort, very low energy use, and limited construction times. The three case studies have been designed starting from the same architectural/structural concept. A detailed analysis, by means of finite element method and dynamic building thermal simulations, has been performed to predict the overall performances of each case study. The results show: (i) high replicability of the concept; (ii) high customization of the envelope technologies; (iii) high energy efficiency; and (iv) high thermal comfort of the architecture. The useful energy requirement in all the three analyzed scenarios is minimized and equal to 14.13, 23.88, and 41.83 kWh/m(2)year, respectively, for the students' lab, the Alpine shelter and the emergency shelter. According to this study the energy needs can be covered by renewable energy produced on site, making the architectural concept an interesting modular lightweight solution for a nearly zero energy building with high potential for replicability.",10.3390/su12155986,0.0

Because these systems use steel headed stud anchors welded onto steel flanges and encased in cast-in-place concrete slabs to achieve composite action, it is not possible to readily deconstruct and reuse the steel beams and concrete slabs. As the building industry is moving towards sustainability, there are clear needs for developing sustainable steel-concrete composite floor systems to facilitate material reuse, minimize consumption of raw materials, and reduce end-of-life building waste. This paper presents the behavior and design strategies for a sustainable steel-concrete composite floor system. In this system, deconstructable clamping connectors are utilized to attach precast concrete planks to steel beams to achieve composite action. The load-slip behavior of the clamping connectors was studied in pushout tests, and the test results showed that the clamping connectors possess similar shear strength to 19 mm diameter shear studs and much greater slip capacity. Four full-scale beam tests were performed to investigate the flexural behavior of the deconstructable composite beams under gravity loading and validate the connector behavior attained from the pushout tests. All the beams behaved in a ductile manner. The flexural strengths of the composite beam specimens closely match the strengths predicted for composite beams by the design provisions of the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC).",,

The building, intended mainly as a wine cellar, offers innovative construction solutions of high deconstructability and has features of low environmental impact, economic competitiveness and constructive simplicity. In particular, the design of the basement cellar involves the use of gabions and stones for the realization of the foundations, the ground retaining walls and all other bearing walls. A different solution is adopted for the external wall which remains entirely above ground. It is also made by gabions, but it is externally covered with a coat of straw bales and is plastered with clay or lime. The roof-bearing structure is made of steel beams and galvanized steel sheets. A layer of fertile soil is arranged on the roof to form a green roof system. This research aims to spread the design criteria of deconstructable buildings, based on the use of natural materials with low environmental and economic impact.

In domains other than AEC such methodologies are well-established and contribute to improving design performance. A step towards advancing AEC design management is to characterize design practices and explore the methodologies on which they may be based. In this vein, the authors describe a design practice observed while participating in the development of a design-build-operate-and-maintain (DBOM) proposal for an infrastructure megaproject. The development team's design process followed a point-based methodology, i.e., early selection from a small set of design alternatives. The team was structured as a three-party joint venture, but, as observed, integration of efforts and collaboration among its design engineers and contractors were difficult and infrequent. The point-based design methodology used showed limitations. The authors counterpose methodologies including select-and-reuse or set-based design. Especially the latter is worth adopting in our AEC industry because it has resulted in superior design performance in other domains. By characterizing and documenting a design management methodology used in practice and counterposing alternatives, the authors aim to spur discussion on the teaching and practical application of AEC design management methodologies.

This paper presents the ongoing research process for the proposed design. The pavilion consists of two discretized acrylic plastic shell structures that utilize the response of materials exposed to heat as a generator of form. Adding to the ongoing discourse surrounding the challenge of plastic in the waste stream, Two Blue Shells proposes a novel way to reuse small flat sheets of acrylic scrap to create large doubly-curved shell structures without complex molds or fabrication technology. Digital simulations are informed by small-scale prototypes and are used for analysis and iteration of the full-scale form. Technical considerations include connection design, overall strength and stability, and the influence of discretization on global and local curvature. The frame used to hang the acrylic in the oven is an integral aspect of the project. While the frame must respond to limitations based on available oven sizes, it also provides opportunities to influence the final form through manipulation of the boundary conditions.

However, despite the environmental benefits involved, additional costs and increased design difficulty limit the application of reuse. This paper proposes an optimal design method that minimizes the CO2 emissions and costs of the noise barrier tunnel. In the proposed method, information on reusable steel beams from the building information modeling data of the noise barrier tunnel is extracted, and the optimization problem is defined. In addition, designs and component procurement plans aiming to minimize CO2 emissions and costs are derived using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The results of the case study show that depending on the situation, CO2 emissions are reduced from 1% to 92% and costs are reduced by up to 25% relative to the case without reuse. As in previous studies, CO2 emission could be reduced herein through reuse, but an increase in costs was observed in some cases. This study contributes to the literature by providing optimal alternatives for designers through an optimal design method integrating strategies to overcome barriers to the practice of reuse. The case study results also highlight the need for an assessment through the entire life cycle, including the modification and in-spection processes of reusable components that are generally excluded.

This study aims to identify the main determinants of SWM practices in a low-middle income country while accounting for citizens' perceived knowledge, attitudes, structural barriers, and willingness to pay for different services. Three communities were thus selected with varying socioeconomic factors and where different SWM practices were adopted. A cross-sectional study based on an interviewer-administered questionnaire was conducted across the three areas. Our results showed that increased knowledge and awareness of proper SWM did not correlate with people's attitudes nor with their adoption of positive waste management practices, such as reusing, reducing, recycling, and sorting of waste. Nevertheless, the results showed that the presence of an effective SWM system in a community positively influenced people's attitudes. Structural determinants, including the lack of appropriate facilities and adequate infrastructure, weak public knowledge on sorting, recycling, and composting, as well as the absence of guiding policies, appeared to be core barriers hindering the adoption of sustainable waste management practices across the three communities.

To clarify conflicting guidelines, this study provides a new improved method and investigates its applicability by comparing it to two approaches suggested in previous literature. The study investigates the effects of methodological choices by applying them in the life cycle assessment of three buildings with the same spatial layout but different structural solutions: business as usual, wooden structures, and hybrid building with structures designed for disassembly. The method was streamlined by focusing solely on the category of global warming potential and by using table values in life cycle stages that have minor role. The assessment shows that design-for-disassembly could be as powerful climate protection strategy as wooden structures. The main result of this study is the verification of a new secure method for assessing the design-for-disassembly components. The suggested approach would improve the applicability of life cycle assessment in a normative context by improving the consistency of assessment in the case of circular economy.

This paper addresses these challenges by leveraging on BIM (building information model) as a central data repository of component information. The contributions of the paper include identifying additional attributes to support DfD, as well as proposing a rule-based compatibility analysis. This will allow potential matches of DfD components between the current building and the future reuse to be automatically identified.

To address these challenges the UK Government and the construction industry have been promoting modular construction; a method that can improve efficiency and productivity in the construction sector via the prefabrication of volumetric elements or structural components of a building off-site and their assembly on-site. In this study we highlight that while modular construction can help deliver sustainability credentials in the entire construction value chain, at present the sector's activities are concentrated on using modular construction to improve resource efficiency upstream of the construction value chain, i.e. at the design, manufacture and construction. This appears to be divorced from the need to promote resource efficiency and productivity at the stages occurring downstream (i.e., disassembly and end-of-life management) of the construction value chain. Such divergence could hamper construction industry's efforts to reduce its environmental and economic impacts in the future, and points to the need of an integrated, holistic approach to improving the sustainability of the sector. To support our argument, we provide an overview of the current state of modular construction in the UK, and outline key obstacles in rolling out modular construction's mainstream use. We posit that modular construction presents an opportunity to integrate upstream with downstream construction practices and achieve sustainability in the entire construction sector, and suggest that the development of a digitally enabled modular construction, whereby smart technologies are combined with modular construction, could be instrumental in supporting this vision. A smart, modular construction regime can operationalise the collection and storage of components' lifecycle information, and help the sector build the capabilities needed to support the maintenance, recovery and reuse of modular components, and reduction of waste. For this to take precedence it is imperative to think of the 'end' right at the beginning of the design stage, and foster an improved collaboration between all stakeholders involved in the construction value chain.",10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102820,0.0

198,"Khayyat, NT",Discussion of the Results and Policy Implications,Editorial Material; Book Chapter,,"This chapter summarizes the findings from the estimated models. The empirical results are summarized for (i) The mean in case of production function and energy demand function without risk, and (ii) for the mean and variance function in the case of energy demand accounting for risk, in which the findings are related to the theory of the competitive firm under production risk. The empirical results are also discussed in relation to the information available about the industrial sector for the data period. Furthermore, the chapter covers the implications and policy recommendations based on the estimated models for production function and energy demand. According to the results a noticeable increase in consumption of energy in the South Korean industrial sector was observed during the 2000s due to the rapid industrialization and urbanization. The estimated mean input elasticities of energy with respect to output and other inputs were differ for the two model specifications, i.e. energy demand with and without risk, but are fairly consistent in terms of the ranking of inputs. The construction of these elasticities and their sizes reveal significant structural attributes of South Korean industrial sector. The technological progress of South Korean industrial sector leads to greater materials efficiency in the production due to recycling wastes and reusing the materials to the production process. The industries with the technological advancement were able to change their manufacturing process over time through decreasing the use of expensive materials and resources redistribution. Industries classified as high technology, largest size, domestic oriented market, and highest scale of R&D investment are those with the highest values for elasticity of energy. On the other hand, the medium technology classified industries, largest size in terms of labor, export oriented, and industries with medium scale of R&D investment are among industries with the lowest values of elasticity of energy. The elasticity of ICT capital is the smallest among all the input factors of production. In general the trend shows an increasing and fluctuating growth over time. Although South Korea is considered one of the strongest ICT producing countries, the results show relativity weak ICT usage in the industrial sector. The government's excessive regulations have lowered the productivity in the service industries. In addition to that, the South Korean public sector suffers from true competition, in which it hampers the ICT usage effects and to explore more renewable and sustainable growth. In general, all industries are exhibiting increasing returns to scale. The returns to scale measures increase in the output resulting from increase in the energy use, conditional on other inputs and technology. The empirical model of the energy demand with risk provides evidence of significant marginal effects in inputs which indicates that some inputs are risk increasing and some are risk decreasing factors. The value added services and ICT capital are the only two inputs decreasing risk, with ICT capital having clearly the most significant reducing effect on energy use variance. The author believes that any increase in non-ICT capital with all other inputs held fixed must lead to reduction in the level of energy demand risk if the two variables are found to be substituting each other. However, the complementarity relationship between energy and non-ICT capital is found in this study, indicating the possibility of non-ICT capital to be variance increasing input for energy. There are three input factors increasing the variability of energy non-ICT capital, materials, and labor. As for technical efficiency, the results indicate in general inefficiency in the use of energy. However, the technical efficiency is slightly increasing over time except during the period of the two oil shocks, and a large variation across the industries is observed.",10.1007/978-94-017-9953-9_10,0.0
219,"Power, A","Does demolition or refurbishment of old and inefficient homes help to increase our environmental, social and economic viability?",Article,,"The issue of whether to demolish or refurbish older housing has been debated for over a century. It has been an active policy area since the late 1880s, when the Government first authorised the statutory demolition of insanitary slums. In the 1960s, revulsion at the scale of 'demolition blight' and new building caused a rethink, leading to a major reinvestment in inner city neighbourboods of older housing. In the past 5 years, debate on demolition and new building has been intensified by the Government's Sustainable Communities Plan of 2003, with its proposals for large-scale clearance and building. Environmental arguments about renovating the existing stock have gained increasing prominence as people have sought to defend their communities from demolition. The evidence on whether demolition would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we emit into the atmosphere is unclear and disputed. This paper summarises the evidence and arguments, and attempts to clarify the most realistic, achievable route to major reductions in energy use in homes. The arguments that apply to housing also apply to most other buildings and therefore to the overall built environment, which accounts for half of all carbon emissions. Three main sources of evidence have helped in the development of this paper, but there are many other studies we draw on in the discussion. Firstly, the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University has argued that around three million demolitions are necessary by 2050 if we are to reach the stringent energy reduction targets that will be required in our housing stock [Boardman et al., 2005. 40% House. Environmental Change Institute, Oxford]. Its demolition figure is based on complex modelling that with small modifications can produce very different numbers. Its assessment does not take account of the embodied carbon costs such as volume of new materials, energy use in producing concrete, steel and other structural and infrastructural elements, and other factors affecting the environment Such as land use, infrastructure and area blighting. We discuss these issues in order to clarify the scale of the challenge and the relative value of demolition or renovation. Secondly, the Sustainable Development Commission JSDC, 2006. 'Stock Take': Delivering improvements in existing housing. Sustainable Development Commission, London] argues the urgent need to upgrade the existing stock on the grounds that 70% of all homes that will exist in 2050, even with the ambitious new building programme now announced, are already built. The maximum feasible demolition of two million existing homes by 2050, based on experience to date, suggests that under 10% of the current stock will have been demolished by then. We argue that upgrading this stock to high environmental standards can actually be achieved more cheaply than demolishing it, and with as significant a carbon reduction. Thirdly, the German Federal Housing, Urban and Transport Ministry has announced an ambitious energy reduction programme that will upgrade all pre-1984 homes in Germany by 2020, an estimated 30 million units.' This is based on evidence from several CO(2) reduction programmes since 1996, showing the feasibility of upgrading. An 80% cut in energy use has been achieved, making the performance of the renovated homes at least as good as Germany's current exacting new build standards. The evidence from Germany is more grounded than any that has so far been produced in the UK, as it is based on several thousand examples. The paper also discusses the social and political problems of demolition. There is widespread opposition to large-scale demolition of older stock, mainly pre-1919 terraced homes, which is currently the most 'leaky'. This older property is a prime target for demolition in the Environmental Change Institute's proposals and the Government's plans. The environmental benefits of refurbishment are shown, based on work by the Empty Homes Agency, evidence from English Heritage, the Building Research Establishment and the Prince's Foundation. Work on refurbishment shows that existing homes, often in brick-built terraces, are relatively easy to upgrade and, with careful reinvestment in the existing buildings, can achieve as high environmental efficiency standards as current new build. We consider major social, economic and environmental benefits of refurbishment compared with demolition, including: a reduction in the transport costs, reduced landfill disposal, greater reuse of materials, reuse of infill sites and existing infrastructure, reduced new building on flood plains, local economic development, retention of community infrastructure, neighbourhood renewal and management. We weigh these benefits against the full costs of demolition and rebuilding, involving much higher capital costs, higher material wastage, greater embodied carbon inputs, the polluting impact of particulates, greater use of lorry transport for materials and waste, greater use of aggregates, more noise and disruption. On the social issues of housing need and fuel poverty, we argue that refurbishment and infill building are socially more acceptable, cheaper and create far lower environmental impact, while reducing fuel poverty. The incentive problems associated with renovation and the barriers to delivering it are also discussed. The evidence we have uncovered counters the suggestion that large-scale and accelerated demolition would either help us meet our energy and climate change targets or respond to our social needs. Many arguments remain unclear, but the overall balance of evidence suggests that refurbishment most often makes sense on the basis of time, cost, community impact, prevention of sprawl, reuse of existing infrastructure and protection of existing communities. It can also lead to reduced energy use in buildings in both the short and long term. Many factors will influence what happens in practice, but it seems unlikely under any scenario that the rate of demolition will accelerate far above current levels. Upgrading the existing stock is likely to gain in significance for environmental, social and economic reasons. Adopting policies that aid the retention and upgrading of the existing stock will help develop the necessary skills and technologies, save materials and land, and enhance the integration of existing communities in need of regeneration.

Yet, the number of repair service providers as well as demand for repair have declined over the last decades, while more products than ever before were sold. Thus, for a successful transition from a linear to a circular economy the demand for repair services must be boosted to promote repair business. A starting point to achieve this goal is to increase knowledge about the end consumers' intention whether to repair broken products or not. An extensive literature research revealed a comprehensive set of drivers of the repair intention covering aspects related to environmental protection, social acceptance, and economic considerations as well as socio-demographic variables, past behaviour, and perceived repair difficulty. Those factors are not only relevant for a specific product category but for repairs of consumer goods in general. The aim is to evaluate the relevance of those drivers for three different repair intentions: (1) to make use of repair service providers, (2) to self-repair broken items, and (3) to use repair service providers incorporated in a repair network. A quantitative online survey was designed, and distributed in Styria, Austria. By means of a structural equation model the acquired data of 900 respondents was analysed. The results emphasise the trade-off between acting environmentally-friendly and economic aspects like repair cost and time, but also highlight the effect of government intervention - in the form of setting up a network and financial support for repair - on shaping this trade-off. Furthermore, past behaviour is found to strongly drive repair intention. Our research contributes to scientific literature by shedding light on the influence of diverse drivers on different repair intentions. It is also relevant for supporting repair companies' decision making with respect to repair service design, as well as public authorities interested in promoting repair.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130969,0.0

While buildings from the latter half of the last century reach their end-of-life, and rebuilding at the same places becomes ever more important, demolition techniques also become increasingly important. The boundary conditions are a dense building development and high traffic rates, so that any uncontrolled methods for demolition are no longer appropriate. Sustainable construction does not finish at the end-of-life of a building. Since demolition waste is one of the biggest components of all waste, its impact on resources is non negligible. Thus landfilling should be avoided and use of the recycled material needs to be enhanced. This paper takes a closer view to the waste streams and considers technical possibilities during the demolition to avoid unnecessary waste. Methods such as the top-down method and the four-phases-model are introduced. Demolition is still however producing a lot of waste and as such, there is a need for alternatives and recycling to make demolition more eco-efficient.",,

Permeable pavements, a type of structural water sensitive urban design systems can provide additional opportunities for stormwater harvesting and reuse. This study examined the stormwater quality improvements of three permeable pavement basecourse aggregates compared with control environments and five water storage residence times. The study was a split plot experiment based on a randomized design with four replications. Natural stormwater was used as inflow and was stored for 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks in three model basecourse aggregate reservoirs filled with basalt, quartzite and dolomite. Stormwater stored in an empty simulated reservoir for the defined period of time was used as a control. The water quality measurements were dissolved oxygen (DO), EC, pH and turbidity. The results showed changes in water quality in the reservoirs. Particularly, there was a decrease in DO and an increase in pH levels in basalt and an increase in turbidity in the dolomite reservoir. DO levels showed a decreasing trend over time, pH showed the highest levels after two weeks and turbidity showed a very large increase after one week water storage. EC changes were functions of interactions between aggregate types and residence times. Comparing the results with current Australian guidelines for water harvesting and reuse revealed permeable pavements with the selected basecourse aggregates and the residence times will generally yield a water quality adequate for reuse for irrigation of green spaces. These results will contribute to sustainable irrigation management of urban green spaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.01.020,0.0

Although several studies have investigated some aspects of construction and demolition waste management (CDWM), there is a substantial need to empirically analysing effective construction and demolition waste management (ECDWM) considering its contributing factors and the CDWM hierarchy (CDWMH). A framework was proposed to assess the effectiveness of CDWM using CDW stakeholders' attitudes (CDWSA), CDWM within project life cycles (CDWPLC), CDWM with respect to sustainability (SCDWM), and CDWM tools (CDWMT) as factors that effectively affect CDWM, and CDWMH as the most effective strategy to manage CDW, leading to the effective management of CDW. This study analyzed ECDWM in Australia. Thus, 108 large construction companies were approached via an online questionnaire. Data were analyzed through partial least squares based structural equation modelling using SmartPLS. Results (path coefficients) could prove that CDWSA was the most effective factor to CDWM, while CDWPLC was the least effective (ineffective).

The growing perception that it is cheaper to repurpose vacant historical buildings rather than demolishing and rebuilding them is one of the factors that have made the adaptive reuse approach so popular. However, will this also be the case for provincial town centres in New Zealand? The purpose of this paper is to identify and explore the key factors that could influence the efficacy of adaptive reuse, and check for significant differences in the effect that each perceived factor would have on the adaptive reuse efficacy as a justifiable resilient and sustainable approach towards the regeneration of a major provincial town centre in New Zealand that is currently experiencing inner-city shrinkage. Design/methodology/approach A focus group workshop was conducted with 22 stakeholders involved in an existing town centre regeneration agenda for Whanganui. Closed-ended questionnaires were administered to the workshop participants to measure their opinions regarding the efficacy of the adaptive reuse approach for the regeneration of Whanganui's town centre. The participant mix comprised a combination of structural engineers, quantity surveyors, architects, estate valuers, building owners/developers, legal representatives, heritage representatives and local government council representatives. Findings The study reported a high proportion of respondents that strongly agreed to the positive impacts of adaptive reuse with regards to the discussed priority aspects, hence, justifying the efficacy of the approach, towards delivering a vibrant town centre for Whanganui. Also, the Friedman's analysis suggests that no significant differences existed among all perceived adaptive reuse efficacy criteria by the workshop participants, therefore justifying the approach.

157,"Hawkins, W; Cooper, S; Allen, S; Roynon, J; Ibell, T","Embodied carbon assessment using a dynamic climate model: Case-study comparison of a concrete, steel and timber building structure",Article,,"The enormous environmental impact of construction is becoming increasingly apparent and unacceptable to many structural engineers, whose designs typically account for the majority of a building's embodied carbon. It is timely, therefore, that consensus is forming around a methodology for calculating embodied carbon. This encourages the inclusion of all life cycle stages, from material production and construction, through use and eventual demolition, disposal and reuse. In practice, however, end-of-life processes are fraught with uncertainty and often ignored, despite the potentially large associated carbon fluxes. Further uncertainty exists when considering bio-based construction materials, which store carbon during use. There are no widely-accepted means of accounting for timing of these carbon fluxes, despite the long service life of most buildings. Could we consider whole-life carbon in a more holistic and climate-focused way? This article uses dynamic life cycle assessment to convert greenhouse gas emission histories to key climate impacts using a simple dynamic model. The implications for structural design decisions are explored by comparing concrete, steel and timber options for a typical medium-rise building structure. Concrete is found to have a higher impact than steel, with the climate response of both options dominated by the large initial emissions of material production and construction. Timber has the smallest impact, for this example, under a typical scenario with sustainable forest management and re-emission of sequestered carbon at end-of-life. The analysis takes a forward-looking approach to sequestration, with timing corresponding to the growth of replanted trees. An optimistic timber scenario, whereby future carbon-capture technology avoids most end-of-life emissions, demonstrates the possibility of structures with small long-term climate cooling effects. Conversely, in a hypothetical worst-case scenario where no replanting or subsequent sequestration occurs, the long-term warming effect of the timber structure is increased by the net emission of biogenic carbon. Although end-of-life processes are important in the long-term, particularly for timber, the analysis also highlights the importance of the initial emissions from material production and construction. These cause high rates of short-term temperature increase and prolonged accumulation of radiative heat for all the buildings, but the impacts are again lowest for timber. Most importantly, the investigation shows how dynamic life cycle assessment can be used to explore climate impacts in a comprehensive, graphical and unbiased way. As a simple extension to established methodologies for calculating embodied carbon, it is a powerful decision making tool in the climate emergency.",10.1016/j.istruc.2020.12.013,0.0

Whilst operational energy efficiency continues to receive significant attention by researchers, a less well-researched area is the assessment of embodied carbon in the built environment in order to understand where the greatest opportunities for its mitigation and reduction lie. This article approaches the body of academic knowledge on strategies to tackle embodied carbon (EC) and uses a systematic review of the available evidence to answer the following research question: how should we mitigate and reduce EC in the built environment? 102 journal articles have been reviewed systematically in the fields of embodied carbon mitigation and reduction, and life cycle assessment. In total, 17 mitigation strategies have been identified from within the existing literature which have been discussed through a meta-analysis on available data. Results reveal that no single mitigation strategy alone seems able to tackle the problem; rather, a pluralistic approach is necessary. The use of materials with lower EC, better design, an increased reuse of EC-intensive materials, and stronger policy drivers all emerged as key elements for a quicker transition to a low carbon built environment. The meta-analysis on 77 LCAs also shows an extremely incomplete and short-sighted approach to life cycle studies. Most studies only assess the manufacturing stages, often completely overlooking impacts occurring during the occupancy stage and at the end of life of the building. The LCA research community have the responsibility to address such shortcomings and work towards more complete and meaningful assessments. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Bridges play a critical role in transportation infrastructure. As reducing environmental impacts has taken on increasing urgency across the construction sector, bridges have received relatively little study. A quantitative understanding of the embodied greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in bridges is needed to inform future infrastructure planning, design, and construction. Recent efforts to streamline environmental assessment in construction have led to the creation and adoption of Building Information Model (BIM) based embodied GHG assessments, taking advantage of the quantity take-off functionality of BIM. However, as BIMs are rarely developed with environmental assessment as the primary goal, their effectiveness for GHG accounting can be limited. GHG assessments of the case study bridge using a BIM prepared before construction and using material and energy quantities records collected on-site during construction, are compared. Using only the quantities from preconstruction BIM, the embodied GHG for the case study bridge is 1.3 x 10(6) kgCO(2)e. After the adjustments for on-site data collection and factors commonly excluded from BIM, such as on-site fuel use from machinery, it rises to 4.06 x 10(6) kgCO(2)e, an increase of 212%. Results illustrate the need to change the scope and detail of BIMs if they are to be effective for embodied GHG assessment, and the potential limitations of using BIM in embodied GHG assessment.

Fines contain soil, wood, gypsum drywall, concrete, paper, and plastic and they often contain trace chemicals that exceed regulatory thresholds. We examined water washing as a means of CDD fines beneficiation to lower trace contaminants levels and achieve acceptable physical properties for road base use applications. Nine sources of CDD fines from across the US were processed to remove the finer and floatable fractions and retrieve a coarse aggregate. The targeted material, washed coarse aggregate, was on average 30% (10-49%) by mass. The concentrations of arsenic, lead, benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), and sulfate in nearly all samples decreased following washing, while the bulk density and specific gravity increased. A comparison of washed coarse aggregate samples' chemical concentrations to risk thresholds yielded varied results; in some samples the lead and arsenic concentrations significantly decreased lower than the most strict thresholds. In other samples although the BaP concentrations decreased they were still higher than the least strict thresholds. The physical properties of the washed coarse aggregate (specific gravity, density, and absorption) were compared and found like recycled concrete aggregate (a commonly used road base material). However, the washing process removed the fine fraction from the aggregate matrix resulting in a poorly graded material for road base/structural fill. Washing as a treatment method to reduce trace contaminants is promising for recycling decision makers aiming to more sustainably manage their fines, however, more physical property testing are needed to confirm its structural suitability.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.106361,0.0

To reduce substantially material consumption and waste caused by the construction industry, structures can be designed and built with reused elements. Structural element reuse involves: element sourcing and deconstruction, reconditioning and transport. As these processes also generate environmental impacts, reuse might not always be preferred over new construction. This paper presents a method to design reticular structures with minimal environmental impact made from reused and new elements. The formulation given in this paper is based on a combination of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and discrete structural optimization. The LCA carried out in this work accounts for impacts generated from sourcing reclaimed elements to the assembly of the structure. Structural optimization is subject to stress constraints on element capacity and deflection limits for serviceability. Typical loading scenarios are considered. The method is applied to the design of three single-span steel trusses of different topology subject to 100 simulated stocks of reusable elements that have varying cross-sections and lengths. Benchmarks against minimum-weight solutions made solely from recycled steel show that this method produces structures with up to 56% lower environmental impact. Depending on stock availability, the lowest environmental impact is achieved through a combination of reused and new elements. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In the construction sector, FRP are mainly used for strengthening existing buildings, thus creating the possibility of avoiding the environmental problems resulting from demolishing these structures and constructing new ones. In the light of this new opportunity, the present paper aims at evaluating and comparing the environmental performances of an unstrengthened reinforced concrete (RC) beam with those of different carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) flexural strengthening techniques. The paper uses Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology in order to determine the most environmentally friendly solution in the case of an existing RC beam which does not properly satisfy the structural demands. The authors have decided to use the Cradle-to-Gate LCA type of study, considering that the primary goal of the paper is to establish whether strengthening and reusing an existing RC beam can be considered a more viable environmentally friendly proposal in contrast with demolishing the existing structural element and constructing a new one. The following impact categories are used with the purpose of achieving a clear understanding of the products' environmental influence: Climate Change, Human Toxicity, and Ozone Depletion. Their environmental performances are evaluated using the GaBi 6 software. The obtained results show that all the assessed CFRP strengthening solutions have a significantly lower environmental impact in comparison with those of the RC beam. In the case of the analysed RC structural element, the highest impact is attributed to the manufacturing stage of the cement and to the steel reinforcements. In most of the CFRP strengthening schemes, the environmental impact is mainly influenced by the amount of component materials (fibre and resin) used for manufacturing the considered composite elements. The resulted values for the environmental parameters in the assessed case studies encourage the authors to assert that the usage of composite materials in specific civil engineering applications can represent an environmentally friendly solution. The environmental aspect of sustainability can thus be achieved in this industry by using particular FRP strengthening applications. Moreover, the negative effects of modern society over Earth can be reduced. The paper concludes that the usage of composite materials can represent an important step towards the sustainable development of the construction sector.",10.1007/s11367-015-0940-5,0.0

Reuse of structural elements made of concrete is of particular interest, given the large use of this material worldwide and its high environmental impact. Reusing constructive concrete elements is however challenging, particularly because connections between concrete structural elements are difficult to disassemble. It is then worth designing reuse techniques for concrete load-bearing elements and to verify their environmental performance using comprehensive methods such as Life Cycle Assessment. Based on the Design for Reuse concept, this article assesses the environmental impacts of a reusable structural portal frame constitutive of a concrete building and compares it to a traditional design with new materials. It relies on data collected through an experimental protocol of reinforced concrete structures construction/deconstruction/reconstruction using hydrodemolition. Impact scores are significantly reduced for all environmental categories after a first reuse cycle, both at the scale of a portal frame or a building. Concrete, and particularly high performance concrete, has durability qualities allowing to undergo several usage cycles. The effectiveness of environmental benefits however depends on functional downgrading and material losses. Guidance should then be provided to insure that future reuse practices will actually provide the expected benefits.

The study found that 10 million tons of wood are contained in the structures of residential houses built before 1969, equivalent to around 59% of the stock. Since much of this stock is nearing end of life, this material should soon become available for cascading so providing a significant potential resource. It was also found that, overall, the structural parts of residential houses embody 17.5 million tons of wood, of which around 9 million tons is, theoretically, reusable and recyclable. However, for effective reuse and recycling, further analysis of the quality, type and future availability of recovered wood is required. The current results could be used for material stock and flow analyses to help planning for the use of recovered wood.

In this study, we use water footprint (WF), which includes water quantity and water quality (represented by blue WF and grey WF, respectively) to calculate the impact of urban household consumption on water resources. Multiple data sources, including the Water Resources Bulletin, China Environmental Statistical Yearbook, China Statistics Yearbook, and First Pollution Sources Census, among others, are considered. The results indicate that the per capita WF of urban household consumption has decreased from 1992 to 2012 in China mainly because of technological innovations. Food consumption contributes the most to the total WF of Chinese urban households. In terms of different income groups, a higher income likely leads to a larger WE. However, reducing the WF intensity may be insufficient for curbing the future increase in WFs. Food related WF has already shown an increase since 2007 mainly because of the diet transition to animal based food with larger WE. Thus, apart from technological innovations, measures need to be adopted to curb the consumption of goods with relatively larger WF and subsequently decrease the WF of Chinese urban households.

It allows for the creation of flexible geometric models using parameters for dimensions and makes it possible to define numeric relationships between these parameters by means of mathematical formulas and define geometric-topological constraints between geometric entities. The result is a flexible geometric model that can be steered through the manipulation of its primary parameters. In contrast to explicit geometric models with fixed dimensions, a parametric model can capture the design intent and represent domain knowledge. The use of parametric modeling techniques is particularly beneficial for designing bridges. This is because the geometric design of bridges is mainly determined by external constraints resulting from the size and the layout of both the overlying and the undercrossing carriageway. This reduces the effort required for reworking when changes are made, while simultaneously providing a high degree of reusability for the model in other, similar projects, resulting in significantly increased efficiency in the bridge design process. Because of the strong fragmentation of the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, the data exchange between the different participants in a construction project is of crucial importance. The use of neutral, open data formats has proved to be the most suitable approach to realize this data exchange. However, currently existing neutral data formats do not allow for an exchange of parametric geometry. To overcome these technical limitations, this paper introduces an extension to the IFC-Bridge format, thus providing a means of interchanging parametric bridge models. This article describes in detail the necessary entities introduced to define parameters and capture dimensional and geometric constraints. The suitability of the developed extensions is proved by presenting the successful transfer of parametric bridge models between two parametric design systems as well as from a design system to a structural analysis system.

However, within current paradigms of lowering carbon emissions and enhancing the possibly of material recycling, such traditional composite beams cannot be deconstructed easily and their elements are not recyclable because they rely on welded headed stud connectors that are encased within cast in situ concrete to achieve the necessary shear connection. This paper presents the detailed results of quasi-static tests conducted on full-scale composite beams as part of a novel deconstructable and sustainable structural system. For this system, precast concrete slabs are attached to a steel beam using tensioned high strength friction-grip bolts in clearance holes as the elements to provide the shear connection. The precast slabs are made using geopolymer concrete in lieu of concrete made from ordinary Portland cement, whose manufacture is a major contributor to anthropogenic CO2 emissions worldwide, thereby enhancing the low-carbon attributes of the structural system. The test results demonstrate the very significant ductility of the beams, with substantial interface slips being developed and sustained at loads close to the ultimate strength limit state. The tension induced in the bolts provides sufficient frictional resistance between the precast slabs and steel beams to ensure that the composite system has full shear interaction throughout the range of service loading. It is also confirmed that composite beams with bolted shear connectors can be deconstructed easily at the end of their service life, with the slabs, steel beams and bolts being reusable in other structural applications.

Two knowledge representing layers, i.e. the principle layer and the physical layer are proposed in the FCBS model. In the principle layer, we focus on the underlying design principles in previous designs and FKC (functional knowledge cell; a kind of function-cell pair) is utilised to represent the principle knowledge. A functional sketch is proposed for recording and demonstrating working principles of design alternative on a functional basis. In the physical layer, case modelling is employed to integrate the structural information and behavioural performances of the existing devices which applies the design principles represented by FKCs. A case is composed of structure and its behaviour. A case-based method is adopted to substantiate functional cells into physical structures in embodiment design, in terms of case embodiment. The behavioural performances are taken as case attributes. A comparison between expected behaviour performances and behavioural performances of the existing artefacts is used to select structures for case adaptation and reuse. A prototype system called the conceptual design tool is developed to implement our approach and a simple example is illustrated with functional sketches.",10.1080/09544828.2011.629318,0.0

It is inevitable that the smelting process during steel recycling operations is expensive and consumes a tremendous amount of energy. Therefore, hypothetically, direct reuse of steel materials without smelting can be environmentally and economically advantageous over recycling. In this article, an innovative recovering path for size-specific sheet metal scrap from the automobile industry is being proposed. The idea is to directly use the sizable sheet metal scrap generated from the car-body manufacturing process in the automobile industry to design and fabricate new metal facade systems for buildings' exteriors. An empirical case study was conducted, which is being presented to illustrate the benefits of reusing steel scrap over recycling with the same material using quantitative analysis. The required capital cost and energy consumption of generating a building metal facade system were evaluated. The results showed that reusing the sheet metal scrap over conventional recycling of the same material would lead to a cost reduction of approximately 40% (400 $/ton) and savings of approximately 67% (10 MJ/kg) of energy consumption. The tested concept promotes an innovative industrial symbiosis between the auto industry and the building and construction industry through creating a secondary closed supply-chain loop to achieve both circular economy and energy savings through adding value by design.

The drivers that impact the uptake of RL are known, but if sustainability outcomes are to be enhanced, the strength of those drivers must be quantified in order to ascertain where efforts should be focused. This study aims to quantify the effects of known drivers on RL, and in so doing identify action items with the greatest potential to positively improve RL outcomes. RL drivers are culled from extant research, and categorized as economic, environmental, or social forces. A conceptual model is developed and tested against questionnaire results drawn from 49 expert respondents active in the South Australian construction industry. The results are analyzed using structured equation modeling. Economic and environmental drivers, such as the continuing relative high cost of salvaged items, along with expediency of cost, time and quality objectives overshadowing regulatory demands for use of such salvaged items, are shown to predict 34% of the variations in implementing RL. Of particular interest is the finding contradicting previous studies, showing that social drivers, such as perceived benefits from 'going green' had no significant impact. Thus, the road-map to improving RL outcomes lies in reducing costs of salvaged materials, augmenting environmental policies that promoted their use, and to initiate a regulatory framework to generate compliance. This insight will be of interest to industry policymakers and environmental strategists alike. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.wasman.2018.07.013,0.0

It is typically discarded with minimal reuse or recycling. As landfill wood disposal could result in methane emissions and/or leaching of hazardous constituents polluting water or soil, the implementation of temporary wood waste reduction strategies must be a critical issue for local construction companies. To manage and control wood waste generation, including setting some reduction goals, it is necessary to identify the influencing factors and ways to quantitatively predict their relative contributions. This study uses a multiple regression statistical model to estimate the amount of temporary wood waste generated in the construction of high-rise buildings by considering the influencing factors related to the design/construction as well as site and safety installations. The case study includes 22 high-rise residential buildings. The regression model predicted approximately 89% of the factors involved in the generation of wood waste in similar constructions. The dependent variables that had an influence on the amount of wood waste are related to design features ('number of floors'), structural construction system ('in situ moulded concrete volume'), and site and safety installations ('site wood fence' and 'wood use rate'). Ways of minimising wood waste generation and the contributions of each type of temporary wood use were discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.wasman.2018.05.057,0.0

The extensive structural investigation of notch-damaged, unrepaired, and laterally unsupported steel beams was performed experimentally and numerically. The simply supported specimens were tested in two-point loading with the study parameters being the location and size of the notch. Some beams had one notch on one edge of the tension flange at different locations, and some beams had two notches on both edges of the tension flange. Three-dimensional numerical models were generated to simulate the behavior of the test beams. After verifying the model, the numerical analysis was extended to cover additional different notch depths and widths. The study showed that the capacity of beams with single notch was more influenced by the notch depth increase than it was by the increase in the notch width. Beams with double notches exhibited an even more pronounced and distinct decrease in the capacity as the notch depth and width increased. This investigation supports the feasibility of reusing pre-damaged steel beams in temporary structures under service loads and certain levels of damage, where the behavior of such beams is within the elastic range and the beam maximum defection is less than the allowable one.",,

Mapping from inspection features to machining features is a practical method to automate this process. In NC machining of aircraft structural parts, composite machining features, surface joining and complex topological adjacency between free-from surfaces make this kind of mapping (one-to-many mapping mostly) much more complicated. In this research, a new feature mapping based feedback method from inspection to process plan is proposed. The geometry of inspection features are categorized into three kinds of basic inspection elements: Axis, Plane, and Surface. Then, the one-to-many mapping is simplified into one-to-one mapping. The correspondence relationships between basic inspection elements and machining features are abstract as mapping rules to obtain the associations between the basic inspection elements and candidate machining features. Through geometric reasoning, the basic inspection elements are mapped into machining features. Then, the measure data as feedback can be transferred to process planner for improving machining process. The optimized machining process will be stored in knowledge base for reusing. A case study is presented in this paper to demonstrate the proposed method.

However, because the headed stud shear connectors are welded onto the top flange of the steel beam and cast into the in situ concrete slab, deconstruction of the composite beam and the reuse of its components at the end of structural life in defence to demolition is virtually impossible, which is at odds with the increasing demands placed on improving the sustainability of building infrastructure. As an alternative, an innovative sustainable composite beam and slab system is proposed, in which precast geopolymer concrete panels are attached to the steel beams using high-strength friction-grip bolts instead of cast in situ floors with pre-welded headed stud connectors. The advantages of a low-carbon design, both by the use of geopolymer concrete elements and system deconstructability, can be achieved in this proposed system. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model is developed to investigate the structural behaviour of the proposed sustainable composite beam and slab system. Material non-liriearities and the interaction of the structural components are included in the model. The accuracy and reliability of the finite element formulation developed are validated by comparisons with experimental results. Extensive parametric studies are conducted to elucidate the effects of the change in the concrete panel configuration, the number and diameter of the bolts, the type and strength of the concrete and the grade of the steel beam on the behaviour of the system. The use of modified rigid plastic analysis is assessed, and a modification is suggested to predict the flexural strengths of the composite beams and slab system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

This causes global warming and waste problems. The demand for the reuse of construction materials is increasing, although it is not the convention, to reduce the environmental impact. Although the sustainable effect of the reuse of materials has been proven in several studies, materials are not always reused in practice, owing to the lack of an information system for reusable materials and the economic uncertainty. In this study, we propose a framework for designing structures using reusable steel beams. The design framework consists of a material bank and a design support tool. The material bank provides information on reusable materials based on the building information modeling. The design support tool generates efficient material procurement plans and provides information about the environmental and economic impact of the project. In a case study used to verify the framework, CO2 emissions were reduced by up to 77% through material reuse, which was consistent with the results of previous studies. However, owing to the cost of processing reusable materials, the overall cost was found to increase by up to about 40%. Therefore, an economic analysis over the entire life cycle when using reusable materials needs to be done.",,

The construction systems considered are reinforced concrete framing (RC), structural steel framing (SS) and cold-formed steel framing (CFS). The framework is developed in accordance with the relevant guidelines for life cycle analysis and sustainability and is intended to support decision making in the design stage. The system boundary for the study is from cradle-to-grave, including all cost components from construction stage, use stage and disposal stage in addition to possible recycling/reuse options. The developed framework integrates building information modeling, energy simulation modeling and end of life scenarios to calculate and compare life cycle costs and sustainability advantages of construction system alternatives. All future costs are discounted to their present value using the appropriate interest rates. Uncertainties in the input parameters are modeled using realistic probability distributions and then used in a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of changes in the input parameters on the result. Application of the developed system to a university building revealed the following results. The total life cycle cost is nearly the same for RC framing system and CFS framing system, while the life cycle cost of SS framing system is 13.4% more. When the system is credited for possible revenues resulting from early operation and recycling/reuse, the total life cycle cost of the RC framing system and the SS framing system become nearly the same while the life cycle cost of the CFS framing system becomes 22% less. Sensitivity analysis of the results shows that the discount rate has the most effect on the estimated mean cost followed by the inflation rate and the construction cost. The sustainability assessment focuses on calculating the LEED points associated with material recycling/reuse potentials and waste management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The reuse of existing building components could support this goal. However, it is difficult to reclaim components from demolition, and materials remain cheap compared with labour, so new approaches are needed for reuse to be implemented beyond niche projects. This study therefore reviews waste interventions. Multiple case studies, spanning new builds and refurbishment, were undertaken to examine systemic mechanisms that lead to components being discarded. Evidence from fieldwork observations, waste documentation, and interviews indicates that the generators of unwanted components effectively decide their fate, and a failure to identify components in advance, uncertainty over usefulness, the perception of cost and programme risk in reclamation, and the preferential order of the waste hierarchy mean that the decision to discard to waste management goes unchallenged. A triage process is proposed to capture timely information about existing building components to be discarded, make this information visible to a wide community, and determine usefulness by focusing creativity already present in the industry on an exhaustive examination of component reusability and upcyclability.",10.3390/su10010229,0.0

In particular, functional case attributes are derived from behavioural and environmental performances, which are different from traditional case modelling. Conceptual design aid is performed with two procedures in this framework. First, functional reasoning (FR) is employed for case clustering based on functionality. A case family is generated, the members of which are cross-product or even cross-domain families, and have similar functions with a required function. Second, constrained similarity measurement (CSM) is used for case selection from the case family, which is generated by FR. The CSM takes design constraints into consideration for design problem solving, which makes the case selection more reasonable.

We develop a conceptual model of how citizens' values are mobilised by grassroots innovations, drawing on the value theory of Schwartz et al.

Using the results of a large scale survey of free reuse groups (e.g. Freecycle and Freegle), which enable collaborative forms of consumption, we apply the conceptual model to explore how participants' values are mobilised and expressed. We show that while the majority of free reuse group participants do hold significantly stronger self-transcendence (i.e. pro-social) values than the wider UK population, they also hold other values in common with that population and a minority actually place less emphasis on self transcendence values. We conclude that diffusion of this particular grassroots innovation is unlikely to be simply value limited and that structural features may be more significant. (C) 2015 The Authors.

One of the key considerations is to use joints that can disengage with minimum labor, part damage, and material contamination. This paper extends our previous work on the design of high-stiffness reversible locator-snap system that can disengage non-destructively with localized heat [1, 2], to include 1) modeling for tolerance stack-up and 2) lock-and-key concept to ensure that snaps only disengage when the right procedure is followed. The design problem is posed as an optimization problem to find the locations, numbers, and orientations of locators and snaps, and the number, locations and sizes of heating areas, which realize the release of snaps with minimum heat, compliance, and tolerance stack-up. The motion and structural requirements are considered constraints. Screw Theory is utilized to precalculate a set of feasible types and orientations of locators and snaps that are examined during optimization. The optimization problem is solved using Multi Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) coupled with structural and thermal FEA. The method is applied on two case studies. The Pareto-optimal solutions present alternative designs with different trade-offs between the design objectives while meeting all the constraints.",,

Since the European Union (EU) launched its bioeconomy strategy in 2012, further bioeconomy policy initiatives have proliferated at regional, national and pan-European levels. Moreover, the EU Green Deal announced in 2019 targets a transition towards a low-carbon sustainable model of growth, food and energy security, biodiversity and natural resource management, where it is envisaged that the bioeconomy will play a key role. Despite a paucity of available data, the surge in policy interest has triggered the need for evidence-based monitoring of bioeconomy sectors and the efficient tailoring of policy support. Thus, on a Member State (MS) basis for the period 2008-2017, we (1) adopt an 'output-based' approach to construct a panel data of performance indicators and (2) characterise the sources of growth and transitional stage of the bioeconomy. Results reveal that the bioeconomy has maintained its relative importance within the total EU27 economy. At the EU level, agriculture and the food industry have played a key role in driving a transition in the primary and industrial bioeconomy sectors due to their significant labour productivity-enhancing impact.

The few studies addressing the matter focus on the estimation of GDP growth and job creation potential of certain circular activities (CA). These CA are assumed to be labour-intensive, so job losses resulting from the paradigm shift should be offset by the overall gains. However, significant structural differences in the economic characteristics of these activities suggest that their development may have dissimilar socio-economic implications, while their promotion would require diverse policy instruments. This paper aims to study the current sectoral structure, main economic features and recent evolution of the CA in the European Union. The focus is on the 24 activities that, according to the NACE Rev. 2, compose the repair, reuse and recycling sectors, as a limited yet representative subset of all the CA currently bound and constrained within the predominant linear economy. Results show that significant differences in labour intensity exist between repair and reuse, on the one hand, and recycling, on the other. Besides, employment concentrates in low-wage labour-intensive CA, suggesting that more attention should be paid to improving competitiveness and working conditions in activities such as repair and reuse which are by definition both ecological and inclusive.

The designed fa & ccedil;ade has been installed in a full scale test-room located in Benevento (south Italy), with typical Mediterranean climate. The proposed analysis suggests that for the behaviour of the designed fa & ccedil;ade, the main influential factors are the solar radiation and the outdoor air temperature meanwhile the wind effect is negligible. Some mathematical correlations have been found and an empirical model that describes the air temperature in the cavity as a function of the external climatic parameters is developed. These findings could be useful for the assessment of performance of similar facades in the design phase but also for comparing the behaviour in different climates. All tests demonstrate that in winter time, in a humid and rainy climate, the prevalent effect is the insulation and the ventilation does not increase the heat losses. The designed system can effectively control the moisture content in the building envelope materials, ensuring dry surfaces and at the same time avoid the alteration of the thermo-hygrometric characteristics for the bacteria and mould proliferation, ensuring healthy environment and avoiding structural damage.

The wide acknowledgement of the need to shift towards more sustainable practices has led to the recognition that demand is multi-faceted; delivered supply should correspond to the varying characteristics of users, taking into account their actual needs in terms of quantity, quality and level of reliability. Such an approach can entail the application of reuse and reclamation methods, which allow for the multiple use of water to meet higher to lower quality needs. Integrated urban water cycle modelling can be a powerful tool in estimating the potential for the application of such options, as it considers issues related to water supply, wastewater production and stormwater runoff in a holistic framework. This paper presents preliminary results from the application of an integrated urban water balance model, Aquacycle, in the Greater Athens Area. The Aquacycle model accounts for water pathways by simulating two subsystems of the urban water cycle (the rainfall-run-off network and the water supply-wastewater network), and the interactions between them. The software package can also be used for evaluating alternative stormwater and wastewater reuse schemes. In this paper, Aquacycle was used for simulating water use, wastewater production and stormwater drainage in the Greater Athens Area. For applying the model, the region was divided into smaller - cluster - scales, according to specific structural characteristics. Then, the model was calibrated and validated against measured data, so that model outputs can account for the overall complexity of the Athens urban environment. Finally, three alternative scenarios, comprising the application of on-site recycling and reuse technologies were simulated and evaluated on the basis of three sustainability indicators (i.e. reduction of imported freshwater, wastewater and stormwater discharge).",,

Researchers have used structural path analysis (SPA) to capture not only the linkages within the production system but also the propagation of the effects into different channels of impacts. However, the SPA literature has restricted itself to showing the relations among sectors of production, while the connections between these sectors and final consumption have attracted little attention. In order to consider the complete set of channels involved, in this paper we propose a structural path method that endogenously incorporates not only sectors of production but also the final consumption of the economy. The empirical application comprises water usages, and analyses the dissemination of exogenous impacts into various channels of water consumption. The results show that the responsibility for water stress is imputed to different sectors and depends on the hypothesis used for the role played by final consumption in the model.

To improve the half slab floor system, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the truss-reinforced half slab's structural performance over its complete loading history. Six experimental tests on such slabs were carried out. Three of them were reinforced with a steel bar truss (SBT) and the other three with a steel tube/bar truss (STBT). The steel tube in an STBT was grouted. The results show that when the specimen is damaged, the grouted steel tube does not undergo out-of-plane or in-plane buckling, and its force performance is good when compared to the steel bar in SBT. Compared with the SBT-reinforced slab specimens, the load characteristic values of the STBT-reinforced slabs were significantly improved, and the slabs had greater initial stiffness and resistance to deformation.

This study aims to integrate HBIM in GBC Historic Building Certification, giving attention to the first thematic area: 'Historic Value'. The implementation process focuses on interoperability and data preservation, using the standard for open-data exchange (IFC). The proposal is based on systematic analysis of the GBC requirements. It includes BIM workflow and framework for the first prerequisite, designed to be extendable on the rest of the Certification. The main outcome is an IFC file, the legacy to be reused regardless of project status.

At present, the commonly used BIW lightweight technology around the world includes the application of high-strength lightweight material, the optimization of vehicle structure as well as application of new molding and connection technology. The optimization of vehicle structure changes the mechanical properties of the components by selecting shape parameters of the components (such as the geometric characteristics of the components), in order to achieve lightweight design or performance optimization design. Since BIW contains a large number of structural components and design variables, designing BIW is always time-consuming and knowledgeable-extensive, which requires the collaboration of multidisciplinary engineers. This paper reviews the main methods of lightweight design of BIW and focuses on the application of knowledge engineering.

Most CAD systems offer functions for defining and storing design knowledge, but user-friendly classification and structuring is still a matter of research. As a consequence, the retrieval of existing templates is challenging and instead of reusing design knowledge in successive development projects, new design solutions have to be created. In this paper an approach to structure Feature Templates is introduced. The approach is based on the generic product structure, which provides extensive contextual information about possible applications of templates. By integrating structural information about Feature Templates into the product structure, reuse of existing design knowledge can be improved.

However, this stage is characterized by limited information, large uncertainty, and multidisciplinary aspects. Thus, increased workload and time cost are associated with conceptual design information acquisition; sometimes, it is difficult to develop novel solutions and the feasibility of the solutions obtained according to these limited and uncertain information is difficult to guarantee. Genetics-based design (GBD) is an effective approach to develop novel solutions and improve the reuse of knowledge, which is consistent with the goal of the conceptual design process. Product-gene acquisition is the premise and basis of GBD. At present, there are few reported studies in this area; most of the existing works are constrained by the structural aspects of the acquisition process, and there are limited studies on specific implementation techniques. To explore the specific implementation technologies of product-gene acquisition, an intelligent acquisition method based on K-means clustering and mutual information-based feature selection algorithm is proposed in this paper. The product genes defined in this paper are key product information that determines the nature of the product and influences the conceptual design process. Thus, solutions obtained according to them are more feasible than that based on limited and uncertain information. An illustrative example is presented. The results show that the proposed method can achieve intelligent acquisition of product genes to a certain extent.

This study demonstrates solutions to this challenge by analyzing a purposely designed case study: the Legacy Living Lab. The challenges of disguising and sealing, such as by waterproofing, two types of connections are analysed: structural and non-structural. This study details the materials and connections used across the two analyzed connection types and compares the weights and reusability of components.

An interdisciplinary Competence Centre for remediation, that concentrates various activities, is being established at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology by the author and three colleagues covering Geotechnique, Economics and Business Administration, especially Construction Business Management, and Public law. The relevance of the theme is underlined by the loss of open land and a large number of urban brownfields, that in many German regions represent in equal parts a structural, planning and environmental handicap. A systematic approach to the management of land with local and regional involvement, is a prime prerequisite for the management of property development in open areas as well as for the mobilization of urban brownfields. Activities throughout the European Unity, under the banner City of Tomorrow, will set standards for indicators of sustainability - including the strongly propagated - concept of land consciousness. Regional land management including used sites is in need for an interdisciplinary remediation.

The presented design approach puts circular design methods and techniques in interior design practice at the core of environmentally responsible architectural design. To achieve its objectives, the implementation of resources efficiency strategy into the interior design scheme should remain a decisive interior design quality criterion. Meanwhile, the issues related to the environmental contextualization of interior spaces and their constitutive components, in fulfilment of sustainable design requirements for the conservation of natural resources, are neither sufficiently recognized by interior designers, nor appropriately highlighted in the current design practice.

Improper management of end-of-life vehicles endangers environment and social life in Malaysia. Excessive water, air and soil pollution are among the primary effects of improper end-of-life vehicle management. These negative impacts have led to an initiative to develop a framework for establishing end-of-life vehicle management system in Malaysia. A set of preliminary factors and underlying items have been identified from previous research efforts. Then, a large survey, with 300 respondents comprising of vehicle manufacturers and distributors, part dealers, and end-of-life vehicle collectors; and high response rate, was conducted. Responses of the survey were factor-analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 20. As a result, the eight success factors namely management responsibility, performance management, capacity management, resource management, stakeholder responsibility, education and awareness, improvement and awareness, and cost management in implementing end-of-life vehicle management system in Malaysia and 33 underlying items are identified and thoroughly discussed. By conducting reliability analysis, all eight success factors are determined to be reliable. Linear relationship among the factors is then confirmed using structural equation modeling. Upon confirmation, the proposed framework containing factors and items, can be valuable for supporting authorities in establishing end-of-life vehicle management system not only in Malaysia, but also in other countries without proper end-of-life vehicle management system.

Fuselage panels are made of a skin-stringer assembly that locally buckles under normal flight loads.

The above changes contributed to an increased awareness about the deep impact that policy decisions have at the local and the global level. Therefore, there is a strong need that policy-making and decision-making processes for a sustainable development be based on the best available knowledge about Earth system and environment. The recent advance of information technologies enables running complex models that use the large amount of Earth Observation datasets available. However, data and model interoperability are still limited to the syntactic level allowing to access and process datasets independently of their structural characteristics (data format, coordinate reference systems, service interface,.) but with no clear reference to their content (the semantic level) and context of use (the pragmatic level). This poses heavy limitations to the reusability of scientific processes and related workflows. The paper presents a general framework to address this issue through the design of a Knowledge Base supporting data and model semantic (and pragmatic) interoperability. In this framework, a general ontology represents the knowledge generation process for policy relevant decision-making, while multiple vocabularies formalize the semantics of data and models, identifying different types of observables, process variables, and indicators/indices.

The addressed domain covers typical bridge structures, deterioration processes, typical defects, causes, materials and test (measurement) methods. Ontologies represent a novel information retrieval and processing system for simpler reuse, sharing and processing of information. Although basically developed in the domain of biomedicine, the free open source ontology editor Protege (2012) was applied to design ontologies in the technical domain of existing bridges. Protege follows worldwide standardized rules established by the www-consortium (W3C). The ontology is exemplarily populated with knowledge and data from the domain of historic iron and steel bridges retrieved from own tests and measurements carried out at the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (Helmerich 2005). Typical causes, deterioration processes and defects are linked to typical structures, sensitive structural details and appropriate methods to detect these defects. All data is formalized to machine readable and processable information and at the same time understandable by humans. An increasing number of case studies or new findings in the domain can enrich the ontology any time and allows the immediate access to the recent findings by other researchers, owners, bridge inspectors or users. Fast knowledge extraction from the system allows inspectors, owners and structural engineers to learn about typical deterioration and defects from available lessons. Then, they can faster identify weak elements or details in historic steel bridges and optimize inspection and assessment strategies.

Therefore, this research expands the new slab comprising Glued laminated timber (GLT) with concrete as a novel lightweight flooring system. The related methodology includes life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) analysis. Thus, the environmental and economic impacts of three common slab systems were compared to the proposed slab. The evaluation results revealed that GLT-concrete has lower emissions in all environmental categories, namely: Global warming potential (GWP), Eutrophi-cation Potential (EP), human toxicity potential (HTP), fossil depletion potential (FDP), terrestrial Ecotoxicity (TE), and Acidification Potential (AP). Likewise, Embodied energy value showed that GLT-concrete has a lower value by 26%, 9%, and 24% than Lightweight steel slab, Precast reinforced slab, and Cofradal slab. Finally, the result of LCC shows a new GLT-concrete slab despite having a higher construction cost, but by considering the end of life scenario as reuse, it will have a lower total cost.

Life cycle analysis of tall onshore wind turbine towers is not very thoroughly investigated in literature, which is a first class opportunity to perform high-end research. More specifically in this work, studies examining the life cycle performance of two types of onshore wind turbine towers are investigated; lattice and tubular. The definition of life cycle analysis and the steps applied for its implementation are also discussed. For Wind Energy LCA five phases are usually taken into consideration: manufacturing and construction, onsite erection and assembling, transportation, operation and finally dismantling At the first steps of the present investigation, a typical system boundary is taken into account and a literature review summary describing the main conclusions from LCA studies on onshore wind turbine towers are presented. From recent LCA results on onshore wind turbines, the manufacturing stage is proved to have the greatest environmental impact, while recycling (that is used as a preferred scenario instead of reuse in the dismantling phase) is proved to act in the most favourable way. In the present study, two wind turbine towers of the same size and same energy production capacity are investigated and compared. Both structural systems, the tubular and the lattice one are proved robust enough and the total material used for their production is calculated in previous work of the research group. The two systems have different production methods, different amounts of material used and different mounting procedures which diversifies their lifecycle performance as a total and their performance in all LCA phases examined separately. Open LCA software was used to assess the lifecycle performance of the two different wind turbine tower types and very important conclusions were derived.

Such large-scale structural abandonment typically necessitates removal of buildings from the landscape, typically via demolition. While expedient, demolition contributes millions of tons of debris to landfills. Deconstruction has emerged as an alternate strategy to demolition, and reduces landfilling through the increased salvage and reuse of building materials. As a result, deconstruction has been suggested as an environmentally-friendly alternative to demolition; however, deconstruction is often costlier and more time-intensive. Despite these differences, little existing literature has focused on assessing the comparative environmental, social, and economic impacts of deconstruction and demolition. This research seeks to answer the question, what are the environmental, social, and economic impacts of building demolition and deconstruction? and proposes a preliminary sustainable life cycle assessment framework, which is the primary contribution. The framework focuses on development of a life cycle inventory matrix for observed environmental, economic, and social aspects related to demolition and deconstruction projects. The framework was developed (1) through a comprehensive literature review, (2) interviews with demolition and deconstruction professionals, and (3) field observation and measurement of selected impact categories. Flows for the assessment framework have been proposed as (1) environmental-landfilling of debris, energy use and fuel consumption, and air/water/soil pollution; (2) economic-energy and fuel costs, equipment and labor rates, value of salvaged materials, hazardous material abatement,and tax exemption; and (3) Social-public health, worker and jobsite safety, noise, and job creation and community involvement.",,

To mitigate carbon emissions, investigation of the current performance of buildings with regard to energy consumption and carbon emissions is necessary. This paper presents a process-based life cycle assessment methodology for assessing carbon emissions of buildings, using a multi-storey reinforced concrete building in a Sri Lankan university as a case study. The entire cradle-to-grave building life cycle was assessed and the life span of the building was assumed as 50 years. The results provide evidence of the significance of operation and material production stages, which contributed to the total carbon emissions by 63.22% and 31.59% respectively. Between them, the main structural materials, concrete and reinforcement steel made up 61.91% of the total carbon emitted at the material production stage. The life cycle carbon emissions of the building were found to be 31.81 kg.m(-2) CO2 per year, which is comparable with the values obtained in similar studies found in the literature. In minimizing the life cycle carbon emissions, the importance of identifying control measures for both building operation and material production at the early design stage were emphasized. Although the other life cycle stages only contributed to about 5.19% of the life cycle carbon emissions, they should also receive attention when formulating control strategies. Some of the recommended strategies are introducing energy efficiency measures in building design and operation, using renewable energy for building operation and manufacturing of materials, identifying designs that can save mass material quantities, using alternative materials that are locally available in Sri Lanka and implementing material reuse and recycling.

An important DfD strategy is the use of prefabricated modular building assemblies and reversible connections, in contrast to cast-in-place composite systems that must be demolished at building end-of-life. In this paper we evaluate a novel DID flooring system consisting of pre-cast concrete planks and clamped connections. Life cycle energy and environmental benefits of using this DM system are evaluated using life cycle assessment (LCA) across four impact categories of interest to the building and construction sector including fossil fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, respiratory effects, and photochemical smog formation. Eight different DM building designs are tested for 0-3 reuses compared with a traditional structural design, with energy and environmental benefits accruing from substitution of avoided structural materials. Designs reflect expected loads and current code requirements, while the additional time required for deconstruction of DM buildings is accounted for in the construction schedules. Monte Carlo simulation is used to generate 95% confidence intervals for the results. In general, DID designs result in higher initial (original building) energy use and environmental impacts, but have statistically lower impacts than traditional designs if flooring planks are used at least once. Reusing planks three times as designed decreases impacts by a mean value of of 60-70%, depending on the building configuration and impact category.

Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) can add value to conventional timber products due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, simple installation, aesthetic features and environmental benefits. Recent changes in the national construction code permit structural timber buildings with a height of up to 25m, which demonstrates the strong commitment of the construction industry to adopt more sustainable practices. This paper aims to compare life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LCGHGE) and life cycle cost (LCC) of CLT and reinforced concrete (RC) in identical midrise residential buildings in three most populated cities in Australia. It has shown that the CLT building has 30 % less LCGHGE compared with the RC building over a life span of 50 years in Melbourne, and 34% and 29% reduction in LCGHCE in Sydney and Brisbane, respectively. The results from LCC analysis showed that CLT building is 1.3% lower than conventional RC in Melbourne, and 0.9% lower in Sydney and Brisbane. The initial and end of life phases reflected reductions in LCGHGE and LCC for the CLT building whilst the operation phase incurred higher values. The extended service life of buildings has a major impact on the operational phase while changes in the discount rate have strong effects on the lifecycle operational and maintenance costs. Overall the CLT building outperformed the RC building in terms of LCGHGE and LCC across three cities. However, further savings in the operational phase with energy efficient methodologies and reuse or recycling of timber products at the end of life of the building can reinforce CLT as a sustainable alternative to RC construction.

In the construction sector, these concepts are slowly being applied to the renovation of the existing building stock by enforcing their deep and holistic renovation targeting sustainability, safety and resilience. Effectiveness of such an approach to the renovation with respect to traditional retrofit actions emerges when broadening the time frame of the analyses, shifting from the construction time to a life cycle perspective. In this case, the potential of the holistic approach becomes clear in reducing costs, impacts on the inhabitants and impacts on the environment over the building life cycle. Within such a new perspective, new technology options are needed to innovatively combine structural retrofit, architectural restyling and energy efficiency measures. Furthermore, a new design approach conjugating the principles of sustainability, safety and resilience over the building life cycle is required. In such a transition, synergistic and cooperative work of researchers, design professionals, and all the stakeholders in the construction sector is required. In this paper, the basic features of an expanded Life Cycle Thinking (eLCT) approach will be presented, which not only entails the use of recyclable/reusable materials, but also encourages interventions carried out from the outside the buildings to reduce building downtime and avoid inhabitant relocation. In addition, such an expanded LCT fosters the adoption of reparable, easy maintainable, adaptable and fully demountable solutions, such as those featuring dry, demountable and pre-fabricated components. Finally, it addresses the need to account for the End of Life scenario from the initial design stages to guarantee selective dismantling and reuse or recycle to reduce construction waste.

We employ four water indicators in China, that is, freshwater consumption, discharge of COD (chemical oxygen demand) in effluent water, cumulative COD and dilution water requirements for cumulative pollution, to investigate the driving forces behind the emerging crisis. The paper finds water intensity improvements can effectively offset annual freshwater consumption and COD discharge driven by per capita GDP growth, but that it had failed to eliminate cumulative pollution in water bodies.

However, the high thermal conductivity of steel presents a drawback, which may lead to thermal bridges if not well designed and executed. Furthermore, given the high number of steel profiles and its reduced thickness, it is not an easy task to accurately predict its thermal performance in laboratory and even less in situ. In a previous article, the authors studied the importance of flaking heat loss in lightweight steel-framed walls. This article discusses several thermal bridges mitigation strategies to improve a lightweight steel-framed wall model, which increase its thermal performance and reduce the energy consumption. The implementation of those mitigation strategies leads to a reduction of 8.3% in the U-value, comparatively to the reference case. An optimization of the wall module insulation layers is also performed (e.g. making use of new insulation materials: aerogel and vacuum insulation panels), which combined with the mitigation approaches allows a decrease of 68% in the U-value, also relatively to the reference case. Some design rules for lightweight steel-framed elements are also presented.",10.1177/1744259115572130,0.0

This sector also contributes a third of the annual EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accordingly, construction represents one priority area for intervention within the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy. Increasing resource efficiency through slowing, closing, and narrowing material and energy loops, is key to mitigating climate change. However, this review paper demonstrates that the analysis of links between circular economy solutions and climate change mitigation has been scarce, despite a recent sharp increase in related literature, with 20 articles (83%) published in 2018-2019. Slowing resource solutions have been the focus of the research and could bring up to 99% savings in GHG emissions per functional unit, where material reuse stands out as the most promising alternative. Closing resource solutions can reduce emissions by 30-50% per functional unit, but results are highly dependent on recycling efficiencies and transportation distances to recovery facilities. Solutions for narrowing resource loops can bring additional GHG savings, but they remain understudied. Despite the promising results for mitigating GHG emissions, this article argues that the circular economy solutions do not always result by default in emission reductions and that a case-by-case quantification is crucial. The implementation of these solutions should be accompanied with further methodological development, such as proper allocation procedures, accurate definition of the system boundaries and integration of forecasts.

This paper addresses the approach of the reuse of steel structure without melting which allows for savings in steel mass and the reduction of waste amounts offering moreover an opportunity to avoid environmental burdens related to the recycling process. Recent studies have stressed the technical feasibility of this strategy, which appears particularly effective in those countries in which a building's life is rather short, such as in Japan and US, though its application encounters more difficulties in most European countries, owing to longer building use. Besides stressing the architectural and structural feasibility of the above-mentioned strategy, this research work aims to quantify the mass savings that are achievable in this manner by presenting a real case study set in Italy. It consists in a railway station, which has been designed keeping in mind the partial employment of structural elements recovered from an old industrial building that is no longer in use. To estimate the amount of steel saved, two different structural models for the designed building have been carried out and compared. In the first one, the structure has been designed on the assumption of the reusing of recovered structural elements; in the second one, the same structure has been designed considering the use of new elements only. The final result of the analysis shows that steel reuse allowed for savings of up to 30% of steel. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.02.011,0.0

It consumes more than half of the total global resources; it is responsible for more than a third of the total global energy use and associated emissions; and generates the greatest and most voluminous waste stream globally. Reuse is considered to be a material and carbon saving practice highly recommended in the construction sector as it can address both waste and carbon emission regulatory targets. This practice offers the possibility to conserve resources through the reclamation of structural components and the carbon embedded in them, as well as opportunities for the development of new business models and the creation of environmental, economic, technical and social value. This paper focuses on the identification and analysis of existing interventions that can promote the reuse of construction components, and outlines the barriers and opportunities arising from this practice as depicted from the global literature. The main conclusions that derive from this study are that the combination of incentives that promote reuse of construction components and recycling of the rest of the construction materials with the provision of specialised education, skills and training would transform the way construction sector currently operates and create opportunities for new business development. Moreover, a typology system developed based on the properties and lifetime of construction components is required in order to provide transparency and guidance in the way construction components are used and reused, in order to make them readily available to designers and contractors. Smart technologies carry the potential to aid the development and uptake of this system by enabling efficient tracking, storage and archiving, while providing information relevant to the environmental and economic savings that can be regained, enabling also better decision-making during construction and deconstruction works. However, further research is required in order to investigate the opportunities and constraints of the use of these technologies. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Globally environmental scientists are looking for innovative and sustainable methods for recovering the useful components from waste consisting of value and can be reused. Presently several waste to energy projects have gained popularity across the world. Unfortunately none of these practices have gained popularity in India and further motivated in pursuing the present study. The objective of the study is twofold.

However, material flows in the building life cycle are difficult to map, especially those initiated by material replacements and at end-of-life. The calculation formula for the number of replacements in buildings in the Life Cycle Assessment standard EN 15978 neglects the effect such replacements may have on the surrounding interdependent building parts, and hence fails to capture the potential benefits of Design for Disassembly. In light of this shortcoming, we propose a method to model the flows of building parts initiated by the disassembly of a building, both during operational and end-of-life stages.

Reciprocal structures were used in the past for different purposes, but in this context, it is worth noting their use for solving the practical issue of spanning distances especiallly in slabs when the available elements were shorter than the span. The use of reciprocally connected elements allows defining a set of variables that allows adapting to design constraints and goals related to structure and construction. Computational strategies are investigated to generate layouts that are able to span planar configurations with non-standard reclaimed elements. This work presents an optimization study for the design of standardized structural layouts for floors and/or walls, using the SPEA-II Multi Objective method. A set of geometrical and material parameters are defined for modelling the panel architecture, while competing objective functions are defined related primarily to aspects such as structural lightness and efficiency in construction.

This regenerative approach contrasts with the traditional linear economy, which has been adopted by the construction industry. Developing new construction technologies for sustainable built environment is a top priority for the construction industry throughout the world.

The construction industry in Europe consumes over 70,000 million tonnes of materials each year and generates over 250 million tonnes of waste. Composite flooring formed by connecting the concrete slabs to the supporting steel beams has been widely used for many years and is well established as one of the most efficient floor systems in multi-storey steel frame building structures. However, shear connectors are welded through the steel decking to the steel beams and cast into the concrete; this made deconstruction and reuse of these components almost impossible. A new composite flooring system which allows for the reuse of the steel beams and composite floor slabs is developed and tested to assess its potential and suitability for reuse.

The connector uses high-strength steel bolts, which are fastened to the top flange of the steel beam with the aid of a special locking nut configuration that prevents bolts from slipping within their holes. Moreover, the connector promotes accelerated construction and overcomes the typical construction tolerance issues of precast structures. Most importantly, the connector allows bridge disassembly. Therefore, it can address different bridge deterioration scenarios with minimum disturbance to traffic flow including the following: (1) precast deck panels can be rapidly uplifted and replaced; (2) connectors can be rapidly removed and replaced; and (3) steel beams can be replaced, whereas precast decks and shear connectors can be reused. A series of push-out tests are conducted to assess the behavior of the connector and quantify the effect of important parameters. The experimental results show shear resistance, stiffness, and slip capacity significantly higher than those of welded shear studs along with superior stiffness and strength against slab uplift.

This paper aims to address the reduction of building structures environmental impacts through reusing structural elements for multiple service lives. Reuse avoids sourcing raw materials and requires little energy for reprocessing. However, to design a new structure reusing elements available from a stock is a challenging problem of combinatorial nature. This is because the structural system layout is a result of the available elements' mechanical and geometric properties. In this paper, structural optimization formulations are proposed to design truss systems from available stock elements. Minimization of weight, cut-off waste and embodied energy are the objective functions subject to ultimate and serviceability constraints. Case studies focusing on embodied energy minimization are presented for: ( 1) three roof systems with predefined geometry and topology; ( 2) a bridge structure whose topology is optimized using the ground structure approach; ( 3) a geometry optimization to better match the optimal topology from 2 and available stock element lengths. In order to benchmark the energy savings through reuse, the optimal layouts obtained with the proposed methods are compared to weight-optimized solutions made of new material.

A detailed analysis of the costs and risks of reuse in practice in the UK is lacking. We found that although there is a sufficient spread between the price of steel scrap and new steel, this difference cannot be captured by the demolition contractors. Rather, reused steel is somewhat more expensive than new elements, except in certain circumstances such as when the reused elements are available from a nearby site, or when testing elements can be avoided. Further, we show that neither the costs of steel reuse, nor the risks, nor its benefits are spread equitably throughout the construction industry supply chain: most of the substantial and capital-intensive changes required for the widespread adoption of steel reuse are concentrated on steelwork contractors and stockists.

This situation leads to information duplication and its associated problems. Besides, traditional product models do not properly handle the high number of variants managed in today competitive markets. In addition, there is a need for an integrated product model to be shared by all the organizations participating in global supply chains (SCs) or all the areas within a company. One way to reach an intelligent integration among product models is by means of an ontology. PRoduct ONTOlogy (PRONTO) is an ontology for the product modeling domain, able to efficiently handle product variants. It defines and integrates two hierarchies to represent product information: the abstraction hierarchy (AH) and the structural one (SH). This contribution presents a ConceptBase formal specification of PRONTO that focuses on the structural hierarchy of products. This hierarchy is a tool to handle product information associated with the multiple available recipes or processes to manufacture a particular product or a set of similar products. The formal specification presented in the paper also includes mechanisms to infer structural information from the explicit knowledge represented at each of the AH levels: Family, VariantSet and Product. This proposal efficiently handles a great number of variants and allows representing product information with distinct granularity degrees, which is a requirement for planning activities taking place at different time horizons. PRONTO easily manages crucial features that should be taken into account in a product representation, such as the efficient handling of product families and variants concepts, composition and decomposition structures and the possibility of specifying constraints. To demonstrate the semantic expressiveness of the proposed ontology a food industry related case-study is addressed and discussed in detail. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, to address the issues of deconstruction and materials reuse and to improve the structural performance of the composite beams, bolted shear connectors have been developed to replace the conventional welded stud. In order to further study their behaviour, the structural performance of the bolted shear connectors were simulated and compared with the welded studs using Abaqus software. A tridimensional numerical model was validated using previously conducted experimental tests and was used as a reference for the parametric study. Height to diameter ratio, friction coefficient of steel-concrete interface, and concrete strength were selected as the main variables for the parametric study, along with the effects of the bolt-hole clearance. The results of numerical simulation were used to develop shear stress and ductility criteria of the innovative shear connector for design rules. The results of parametric studies also showed that the load carrying capacity of composite beams using the bolted shear connectors is influenced by the bolt's height, the friction coefficient of contact surfaces and the concrete strength.

The scope of issues has different tones in growth centres and declining regions. The discussion of demolishing 1960-80's developments started in the 2000's. However, recent studies on the carbon spike of new building as well as the energy and durability performance of existing buildings suggest that a sustainable solution would be not to demolish. To stay in use, 1960-80's housing estates must respond to today's housing preferences. Partial dismantling of large-panel blocks of flats and subsequent element reuse is a holistic solution to a spectrum of interconnected issues. It's feasible in eliminating vacancy, improving image and striving for social cohesion, which all improve the viability of residential areas. Reusing large concrete panels can significantly reduce the environmental burden of new building and introduce the cradle-to-cradle design approach to the Finnish construction industry.",,

Many studies suggest that adaptive reuse is more sustainable than typical demolition and new construction in terms of environmental, social, and economic impacts. However, these claims are qualitative in nature and are limited to analyses at the project scale. This paper presents a methodology based on Input-Output (IO) models for examining economic and energy impacts of substituting adaptive reuse for new building construction. An IO model for the Province of Ontario, Canada, was developed to study the impacts of adaptive reuse building construction. The building construction industries' intermediate inputs and final demands were altered in the Ontario IO model to reflect changes in the supply and demand of adaptive reuse buildings in the construction industries. A basic scenario represents the situation where only the building's superstructure and substructure are reused. The basic scenario was then extended to reflect the reuse of internal non-structural components. The Ontario IO model examines impacts to gross domestic product (GDP), industry outputs, employment and energy use (including rebound effects from household consumption changes). It was found that adaptive reuse building construction may benefit Ontario's economy and reduce energy consumption under certain combinations of changes in supply and demand. The desired domain of adaptive reuse construction, where energy use decreases, while GDP and employment increases, is discerned for both the residential and non-residential building construction sectors in Ontario. This methodology may be used for other regions for which IO information exists. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.120939,0.0

Besides, construction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. According to the waste hierarchies, reuse is preferred to recycling; however, most of the recovery of construction and demolition wastes happens in the form of recycling and not reuse. Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts' opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study. Furthermore, the results of the survey are used to develop an easy-to-understand learner for assessing the technical reusability of the structural elements at the end-of-life of a building.

The qualitative data was analyzed by content analysis of critical incidents. Partial least-squared based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analyses statistically tested the model hypotheses. The results suggest that project communications and project learning contribute positively to time-cost performance of construction projects. Effective communication tools, critical learning situations, and essential reusable project knowledge are identified. Collective sharing of experiences facilitates personal development and enables effective project learning. A triangulated approach was adopted to conceptualize the control loop-process emphasis on networking and communication, collaborative learning, experience accumulation, and expert judgment as critical elements of continuous learning.

To help curb the vicious circle of increasing structural and environmental degradation, the sustainable probability is defined as a conditional probability, and the interaction between structural reliability and environmental impacts is quantified. Global warming potential (GWP) is adopted as the key indicator for environmental impacts. By analyzing the trends of climate change, the GWP limit is set to match the prediction of structural resistance degradation. A new environmental impact allocation rule based on time-dependent resistance is put forward to characterize the environmental benefits of the reuse strategy. With help of the durability life prediction method for reusable components and the stochastic model for time-dependent resistance, the calculation method for sustainable probability is established, catering for both reusable and non-reusable structural components.

Nowadays, the amount of waste generated is considered large, occupying much space in landfills, and its transportation, depending on the volume and weight, is quite expensive. Recycling and reuse of these wastes are extremely important to control and mitigate environmental problems, as well as produce various materials value-added. Over 90% of waste can be recycled, reused and transformed into aggregates with characteristics very similar to the original product, thus creating environmentally friendly products such as sand, gravel, pebbles. This research concerns the study of the properties of concrete containing CDW, aiming its use in the manufacture of concrete blocks to seal without structural function.

To achieve this, a literature review was conducted along with interviews with actors pertinent to timber construction. Moreover, a case study of life cycle environmental impact assessment was conducted to quantify the potential of reusing timber to abate global warming and other environmental burden. The literature review highlighted the possibility of reusing structural timber, but pointed to the need for efficient and standardized assessment criteria. The interviews indicated interest towards the concept of circular economy applied to construction and demolition wood material, although this appears to be driven more by policy and regulation rather than for business reasons. Therefore, a reconfigured conceptual framework to achieve circularity for wood is proposed, where material brokers would be used to connect different actors along the value chain.

This research provides a framework that focuses on data mining techniques to investigate consumer attitudes toward refurbished phones by one of the reverse supply chain practices: refurbishment. Furthermore, the consumer's opinions on refurbished mobile phones found on Twitter have been analyzed, and the most appropriate selling strategy has been proposed. Accordingly, the customer's strong motivating factors were identified by assessing approximately 25,000 tweets. The obtained data are analyzed according to three categories: environmental versus financial motivators, refurbished mobile phone features, and main components of refurbished mobile phones. The results indicate that the environmental factor is slightly higher motivating when compared to the financial factor. Other important features were prioritized from the consumer's point of view (highest to lowest): price, product warranty, quality, and seller's reputation.

It is especially important to identify factors which affect citizen participation in waste reduction and recycling where waste policies are poorly implemented. In this paper we report the results of a research constructed survey conducted in Xiamen, one of eight cities in China which have been operating waste source separation pilot programs since 2000. The results showed that while more than half of respondents were satisfied with local waste management, waste recycling was still inefficient and largely carried out by the informal sector. Satisfaction rates and basic residential house prices were positively correlated, and the satisfaction rate was higher in newly urbanizing areas than in old downtown and urban village areas. A structural equation model Was used to identify key factors influencing citizen environmental willingness to participate in waste management, and this indicated that the most important influencing factor was citizen knowledge, followed by social motivation, while institutional factors had the smallest positive effect. Citizens who were better informed and lived in a community/family with more environmentally friendly behaviors have a greater propensity to participate in sustainable waste management. The model is useful for identifying causal relationships and ranking influencing factors in terms of their importance. The results indicate a waste policy hierarchy in Chinese cities, and future waste management should change from the current legislative-centered strategy. The results can be used to inform decision makers find locally effective strategies to improve public participation in waste management in accordance with socioeconomic and cultural conditions in China.

While there is some recycling of selected construction materials, such as steel and concrete, this is almost always in the form of down cycling or reprocessing. One significant impediment to reuse is that buildings are not designed in a way that facilitates easy recovery of materials and components. This chapter explores the potential for the recovery of materials and components if buildings were designed for such future recovery, utilizing the strategy of design for disassembly. As well as assessing material waste, this chapter presents research into the analysis of the embodied energy in buildings, highlighting its significance in comparison with operational energy. Analysis at material, component and wholeof-building levels shows the potential benefits of strategically designing buildings for future disassembly to recover this embodied energy. Careful consideration at the early design stage can result in the deconstruction of significant portions of buildings and the recovery of their potential through higher order reuse and upcycling.",10.1108/978-1-78714-619-820181024,0.0

Concrete also contributes to a large share of demolition waste, usually coming from building structures that are discarded because of functional obsolescence rather than of technical deficiency. Current practice for treating end-of-life concrete is to landfill it or crush it into aggregates used in new concrete mixes. Instead, a little-explored strategy consists in extending the service life of concrete elements by reusing them in new constructions. Following this paradigm, this paper presents a proof-of-concept prototype that reuses blocks cut out of obsolete cast-in-place concrete walls for a new structural application: a 10 m-long post -tensioned segmented arch footbridge. The paper details the design, material sourcing, and construction pro-cesses while highlighting the unusual features of the approach.

We show that there is a contrast between perceived higher costs and time required to employ reused steel and the assessments of realised projects. Using a novel ranking method inspired from the field of information retrieval (tf-idf), we have analysed interviews of actors across the supply chain to determine the acuteness of the perception of each barrier. We show that demolition contractors, stockists, and fabricators face specific barriers which each need to be addressed at their level.

Thus, strategies to minimize losses are sought after. The material hygiene (MH) concept was introduced to address this issue. Structural features, which are important for the outcome of reuse, recovery, and recycling, were investigated in an earlier field study of discarded dishwashers. It was proposed that a prestep, manual removal of copper prior to shredding could increase the purity of recovered material fractions. This article builds on the field study and theoretical reasoning underlying the MH concept. Dishwashers are assumed to be designed for disassembly when the prestep is introduced. A limited life cycle assessment was performed to determine whether the proposed prestep may be environmentally beneficial in a life cycle perspective. Two alternatives were analyzed: Case 1: the current shredding process. Case 2: prestep removal of copper before shredding. Targeted disassembly prior to shredding may reduce the abiotic depletion and global warming potential in a life cycle perspective. The prestep results in increased copper recovery, but, more important, copper contamination of the recovered steel fractions is reduced.

Despite re-use of a physical part, the engineer had to create a new CAD model. The redesign involved breaking the original part into two pieces. The engineer sketched initial design concepts on paper because manipulation time in the CAD system was so lengthy. After determining the design concept, the engineer created a new CAD model, including new weld locations, and passed it along to analysis engineers for stiffness and crashworthiness FEA testing. Hand-offs between design and analysis engineers were challenged by the PLM system. The paper ends by making recommendations for improving CAD and PLM tools.",,

The reported approaches to designing product platforms assume mature and stable design and manufacturing technologies. Consequently, product platforms are not applicable in the semiconductor equipment manufacturing industries, where the technologies keep evolving and cannot be frozen in the product development process. In response to the application limitations of traditional platforms, a concept of function-technology (FT) platform is put forward to assist semiconductor equipment manufacturers to efficiently design product families by reusing, in a structured way, functions and technologies. To shed light on the diverse constituent elements and the complex relationships inherent in an FT platform, this study focuses on its structural representation. A formalism of FT platform representation is developed based on the unified modelling language (UML). It consists of a generic functional structure, a generic technology structure and the mapping relationships in-between. An application case in a well-known semiconductor equipment manufacturer is also reported to present the structure of an FT platform and its representation based on the UML.",10.1080/00207543.2011.562650,0.0

Demountability and reuse of structures contributes to the reduction of the environmental impact of the built environment. Welded headed studs used in traditional steel-concrete composite floor systems need to be replaced by demountable shear connectors to enable the transition of the construction sector to a circular business model. The demountable shear connectors are embedded in large prefabricated concrete floor elements and connected to steel beams by bolts. The holes in the beam flange are oversized to account for geometrical and dimensional deviations of all members and to facilitate rapid execution and easy demounting. The goal of this paper is to present a methodology that quantifies the required nominal hole clearance for reusable composite floor systems. Statistical characteristics of dimensional and geometrical deviations serve as input for Monte-Carlo simulations. The aggregated results of the Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine the required nominal hole clearance for a specified probability of successful installation of the demountable shear connectors. The proposed methodology is applied to the composite floor system of a demountable and reusable car park building. The contradicting requirement of oversized holes and composite interaction is solved by injecting the hole clearance with a (steel-reinforced) epoxy resin. The bearing resistance of the (steel-reinforced) epoxy resin is addressed based on preliminary results of creep experiments on resin-injected bolted connections.,,

In many countries, this stock is already being demolished or demolition is discussed due to vacancies or social problems. This trend may result in the creation of an unforeseeable amount of concrete waste. Simultaneously, EU has issued the Waste Framework Directive aiming at reuse instead of recycling. Unlike in situ cast concrete, reclaimed prefabricated concrete panels from mass housing carry the potential for reuse. The purpose of this study is to review the reuse potential embedded in Finland's mass housing stock from the perspective of the dimensions of the panels and spaces, i.e., their suitability for architectural (plan) design. The research material consists of architectural drawings of 276 blocks of flats that contain over 26000 prefabricated wall panels and nearly 14 000 hollow-core slabs, the dimensions of which are compared to current norms and guidelines for dimensioning living spaces. The technical prerequisites for reuse are reviewed with the help of literature. The study results in identifying an inventory of panels typical to Finnish precast concrete construction, which, in principle, should not exist because the building plans were not standardized but were supposed to be unique. The panels are found to be still usable in architectural (plan) design of detached houses, which form one third of annual residential production in Finland. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.

The questionnaire survey was administered to a targeted group of 90 architecture/engineering, construction and facilities management (AEC/FM) practitioners of building adaptive reuse, in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The relative importance index (RII) for each factor was calculated. Three levels of agreement, based on the ranking of the factors, among the respondents were determined. Findings The most important factors affecting adaptive reuse of commercial projects are: structural integrity of the building, municipal approval for the land use change, enforcement of safety procedures at the project site, compliance with health and safety measures and accuracy and completeness of the contract documents.

The panel-based system of the ES-KO corporation, which is a major player in this particular market, is described from both the architectural and the engineering points of view. Beyond the classical advantages of off-site systems (e.g., lightness and ease of assembly, speed of construction, transportation, and modularity), specific capacity-design rules can provide high standards of safety durability and structural robustness. Many of these rules can be found in nature, such as exoskeletons, parallelization, redundancy, and compartmentalization. These design issues are suited to particular situations, such as settlements, strong wind, earthquakes, and explosions, because they exploit particular strategies not commonly envisaged in structural design. Moreover, durability ensures the possibility of reusing the modules in different places, reducing the environmental footprint and costs.

Design problems form an essential component of experiments in creativity research. However, the formulation of a design problem for an experiment is still a challenging task. An opportunity for the design community is leverage existing design problems to reduce a source of difference between experiments and increase the validity of new method and tools. To answer this question, fifty-five design problems, published over the past fifteen years, were collected and analyzed using two approaches. First, the information content of the design problems was assessed based on five structural elements. A protocol study was developed with four independent evaluators, who were asked to identify the five elements in a set of design problems. A high correlation was observed for the characteristics: goal of a problem, functional requirements, non-functional requirement and reference to an existing product. A low correlation was observed for the characteristics information about end user. The results suggest that this approach could serve as a useful tool in comparing and selecting problems with a desired number of elements. In the second approach, latent semantic analysis was used to compare the design problems. Latent semantic analysis enables design problem similarity to be computed prior to solving the problem. However, this method cannot identify the nuances in problem representations, which could potentially affect solution development. The paper concludes with an appeal to research community of using similar or benchmarked design problems, and postulate other means to enable comparison or development of problems in creativity research.",,

A review of the extant literature was carried out to identify factors that influence salvage performance of structural components of buildings during their useful life. Thereafter, a mathematical modelling approach was adopted to develop BWPE using the identified factors and principle/concept of Weibull reliability distribution for manufactured products. The model was implemented in Building Information Modelling (BIM) environment and it was tested using case study design. Accordingly, the whole-life salvage performance profiles of the case study building were generated. The results show that building design with steel structure, demountable connections, and prefabricated assemblies produce recoverable materials that are mostly reusable. The study reveals that BWPE is an objective means for determining how much of recoverable materials from buildings are reusable and recyclable at the end of its useful life.

The paper examines whether Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology coupled with Building Information Modelling (BIM) may enable components and/or assemblies to be tracked and imported into virtual models for new buildings at the design stage. The addition of stress sensors to components, which provides the capability of quantifying the stress properties of steel over its working life, may also support best practice reuse of resources. The potential to improve resource efficiency in many areas of production and consumption, emerging from a novel combination of such technologies, is highlighted using a theoretical case study scenario. In addition, a case analysis of the demolition/deconstruction of a former industrial building is conducted to illustrate potential savings in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) from reuse when compared with recycling. The paper outlines the reasoning behind the combination of the discussed technologies and alludes to some possible applications and new business models. For example, a company that currently manufactures and 'sells' steel, or a third party, could find new business opportunities by becoming a 'reseller' of reused steel and providing a 'steel service'. This could be facilitated by its ownership of the database that enables it to know the whereabouts of the steel and to be able to warrant its properties and appropriateness for reuse in certain applications.

To date, existing research efforts have largely ignored this problem class and instead have focused on modelling in simpler application domains. This has been mainly achieved by exploiting approaches based on reasoning from first principles. One of the key issues that arises in modelling research is whether existing first principle approaches can be scaled to deal with more complex engineering application problems.

However, sewer pipes deteriorate, and their accumulated structural defects may release untreated wastewater to the environment via acute breaks or insidious exfiltration. Exfiltrated wastewater constitutes a loss of potentially reusable water and delivers a complex and variable mix of contaminants to urban shallow groundwater. Yet, predicting where deteriorated sewers impinge on shallow groundwater has been challenging. Here we develop and test a spatially explicit model of exfiltration probability based on pipe attributes and groundwater elevation without prior knowledge of exfiltrating defect locations. We find that models of exfiltration probability can predict the probable occurrence in underlying shallow groundwater of established wastewater indicators including the artificial sweetener acesulfame, tryptophan-like fluorescent dissolved organic matter, nitrate, and a stable isotope of water (delta O-18). The strength of the association between exfiltration probability and indicators of wastewater increased when multiple pipe attributes, distance weighting, and groundwater flow direction were considered in the model. The results prove that available sanitary sewer databases and groundwater digital elevation data can be analyzed to predict where pipes are likely leaking and contaminating groundwater.

These problems are characteristic of linear value chains. In contrast, a circular economy approach to building construction has the potential to moderate these three problems. One way this can be achieved is to enable in-use building stocks as a repository of products for future reuse, sometimes referred to as urban mining. A key stage in such a shift is to be able to quantify stocks of construction materials and assess their direct reuse potential as products against criteria such as their location, age, type, and embodied carbon. The majority of studies of building stocks have focused on producing aggregated quantities of materials, regardless of the required information for assessing the potential value streams of future reuse. In this paper, a framework for spatiotemporal mapping of building structural products integrating external geometries and construction history is presented. To demonstrate its capacity, the stocks of clay bricks within the external walls of buildings are assessed where six types of buildings and four types of bricks are specified. Dimensions, weights, ages and embodied carbon of materials are estimated for case studies of three urban regions in Northern England: Manchester, Leeds and Bradford, and the results are spatially mapped for the city of Bradford.

The present study aims to elucidate the regional spatial features of industrial pollution inequality (IPI) (waste gas, wastewater, and solid waste measured by the Theil index separately) and their relevance to national territorial space planning strategies. Furthermore, we make a novel attempt to develop an integrated framework that employs a developed-Kaya identity with the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method to uncover the driving force of IPI disparities. We make use of the data published recently by the provincial panel of China, during the period 2000-2015. Based on this information, we found notable spatial-temporal heterogeneity in China's IPI, highly correlated to China's core national territorial space planning strategy, the T-shaped spatial development strategy. The empirical results support the structural features hypothesis in IPI for China. In particular, the Coastal Region has a great edge in industrial pollution equality. In most provinces in the Inland Corridor along the Yangtze River, the trend of IPI has been alleviated to some extent. However, provinces further inland that are off-side the two axes of T-shaped spatial development strategy have to respond to the two-fold challenge of the exacerbated trend in IPI both within and between the regions. Our findings also indicate that the effect of technological inequality is the main driving force for IPI in the earlier stage of development. However, effects of economic inequality together with that of economic structure inequality manifest in the middle or transition period and the economic inequality effect is the determinant in the later stage of development. Additionally, contributions of size effect and inequality effect are changeable over development process, economic inequality effect outweighs the economic size effect for IPI in more developed districts or districts in higher developing phases.

Structural decomposition analysis, on the other hand, identifies the factors behind the changes in key variables over time. Extending the input-output subsystem model to account for the changes in these variables reveals the channels by which environmental burdens are caused and transmitted throughout the production system. In this paper we propose a decomposition of the changes in the components of CO2 emissions captured by an input-output subsystems representation. The empirical application is for the Spanish service sector, and the economic and environmental data are for years 2000 and 2005. Our results show that services increased their CO2 emissions mainly because of a rise in the emissions generated by non-services to cover the final demand for services. The decomposed effects show a decrease in CO2 emissions due to technological changes between 2000 and 2005 compensated by an increase in emissions caused by the rise in final demand of services. Finally, large asymmetries exist not only in the quantitative changes in the CO2 emissions of the various services but also in the decomposed effects of these changes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The extensive use of computer aided design (CAD), finite element analysis (FEA) and product data management technologies (PDM) has radically changed the design process. We find that the design process can be structured into preliminary models (PM) which are driven in large part by phenomenological models and detailed FEA with possibilities of interoperability between both. We have found that PMs are cognitive models that can be regarded as object oriented, decomposable and runnable. Using IDEFO diagrams, we map the design process from preliminary modelling to FEA and discuss the use of STEP formats like AP203 and AP209. We argue that the use of feature based modelling from the preliminary stage provides interoperability and describe an architecture for creating repositories of design knowledge and data over the entire product life cycle. We illustrate this with the design of a vertical tail of an aircraft that uses the present web and database technologies for the routine design of a typical aerospace component integrating preliminary models and FEA.",,

This paper examines Dutch adaptive reuse practices regarding their functional, operational and financial models, and assesses their circularity performance by evaluating cultural values preservation, circularity of reuse intervention, and outcomes from use. Primary data was collected through an online survey of stakeholders representing 53 cases. We employed Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) to summarize the relationships among variables and Partial Least Square Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) analysis to assess the weights of the active variables and their causal relationships. We then conducted a factorial mapping and hierarchical cluster analysis to investigate further the correlations between certain characteristics, individual cases, and active circularity variables. The findings indicate that there has been a major trend towards more private sector involvement, stimulation for pro-active engagement of local actors, and better dialogue among stakeholders. In addition, stakeholders acknowledge that adaptive reuse strongly contributes to conserving cultural values. However, stakeholders only weakly recognize its correlation to the circularity framework in the limited context of the physical built environment. This study provides essential insights regarding emerging adaptive reuse trends and circularity performance, which can be further incorporated into circular economy strategies and roadmaps for the built environment. The framework established in this paper for analyzing circularity performance of adaptive reuse practices is transferable, and can be replicated in empirical studies worldwide.",10.1016/j.scs.2021.102869,0.0
225,"Eckert, CM; Keller, R; Earl, C; Clarkson, PJ","Supporting change processes in design: Complexity, prediction and reliability",Article; Proceedings Paper,,"Change to existing products is fundamental to design processes. New products are often designed through change or modification to existing products. Specific parts or subsystems are changed to similar ones whilst others are directly reused. Design by modification applies particularly to safety critical products where the reuse of existing working parts and subsystems can reduce cost and risk. However change is rarely a matter of just reusing or modifying parts. Changing one part can propagate through the entire design leading to costly rework or jeopardising the integrity of the whole product. This paper characterises product change based on studies in the aerospace and automotive industry and introduces tools to aid designers in understanding the potential effects of change. Two ways of supporting designers are described: probabilistic prediction of the effects of change and visualisation of change propagation through product connectivities. Change propagation has uncertainties which are amplified by the choices designers make in practice as they implement change. Change prediction and visualisation is discussed with reference to complexity in three areas of product development: the structural backcloth of connectivities in the existing product (and its processes), the descriptions of the product used in design and the actions taken to carry out changes.

The analyses include structural response (via numerical models), optimization potential (material take off, building schedule and economic cost) and environmental impact (via Life Cycle Assessment, LCA). The connection is applied to a case study which is representative of common buildings: a seven-story concrete structure with frames and deck slabs. The structural response of the connection accomplishes the Eurocode safety prescriptions. Man-hours and task duration decrease around 80%, and the global schedule undergoes 60% diminution. Focusing on economic issues, when the prefabricated structural elements are reused the accumulated economic cost significantly decreases. LCA shows that durability, in terms of service life, is directly related to the environmental impact.

The goal of this paper is to describe and address issues associated with the proposed design methodologies to determine which, if any, can produce the most sustainable structural designs.

In configuration design for larger and more complex systems (e.g., street cars), however, this often is not really true. The reason is that sometimes the component library offers no component that meets the actual requirements, so that a new component has to be added to the library. In general, configuration design for larger products must be interactive: interactive in the sense that the user controls the configuration process and in the sense that the phases of knowledge acquisition and configuration are partly mixed. This paper describes a method and a corresponding software tool (SyDeR, System Design for Reusability) that support the interactive configuration design of complex products, especially in the tendering phase. It combines three different technologies: structural modeling of technical systems; a library for technical solutions, which is based upon taxonomies and allows the reuse of the technical solutions; constraint techniques to propagate design decisions and check designs for consistency to support interactive configuration design. This paper gives an overview of the functionality of the SyDeR tool and describes the main ideas behind the modeling language, which is especially oriented towards the requirements of system design problems.

Structural and textural features of MIL-100(Fe) supported by GFS (GFS/MIL-100(Fe)) were characterized by different techniques. GFS/MIL-100(Fe) showed higher specific surface area and better rhodamine B (RHB) removal performance as well as reusability. RHB removal percentage by GFS/MIL-100(Fe) reached 92% in 11 h, compared with 79% in 7 h of MIL-100(Fe). The highest RHB removal rate was obtained with the GFS/MIL-100(Fe) concentration of 20 g/L. Increasing RHB concentration over 100 mg/L reduced the time needed for saturated adsorption from 11 to 7 h. The best RHB removal performance of GFS/MIL-100(Fe) was obtained at pH = 3, and the removal percentage was almost the same in the pH range 5-11. The adsorption data fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetics better than the pseudo-first-order kinetics, and the adsorption isotherm data fitted Langmuir model better than Freundlich model. MIL-100(Fe) synthesized in organic solvents showed higher loading rate than that obtained in water. GFS/MIL-100(Fe) also showed promising removal performances for methylene blue, acid orange 7, and malachite green in water.

The subject was presented by investigating the share of such buildings in the achievement of housing goals in Germany and Poland, where they currently constitute one of the most dynamically developing housing sector branches. The phenomenon has been presented via comparative analyses of selected designs by manufacturers from the sector and development companies. Prefabrication is essentially based on optimising architectural and structural solutions and leads to lowering financial and material cost; decreasing project completion time. At present, these goals are achieved by systematising the design and construction process and using the potential offered by building information modelling technology (BIM). This enables coordination between design specialisations and reduces the number of errors, increasing manufacturing and assembly efficiency. Innovative prefabricated technologies are solutions that are either new or are considerably improved in terms of technical specifications, components and materials, that use the latest software, are easy to assemble, durable, energy efficient, can be disassembled and reused and have a low carbon footprint and can be considered aesthetically pleasing.

The mechanical properties of the reproduced composite board were examined by considering the effects of mass fraction and glass-fiber distribution. Interfacial-layer micrograph analysis of the composite material fracture surface was used to study the fiber reinforcement mechanism. Results showed that using comminuted glass-fiber-reinforced resin as a filler material greatly enhanced the performance properties of the composite board. Although the length and diameter of filler varied, these variations had no appreciable effect on the mechanical properties of the processed board. Maximum values of 48.30 MPa for flexural strength, 31.34 MPa for tensile strength, and 31.34 J/m for impact strength were achieved from a composite board containing mass fractions of 30, 10, and 20% glass-fiber-reinforced resin waste, respectively. It was found that the maximum amount of recyclate that could be added to a composite board was 30% of weight. Beyond these percentages, the materials blend became unmanageable and the mixture less amenable to impregnation with fiber.

Recently, several studies have focused on establishing strategies to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide in the AEC industry by utilisation of low-carbon materials, material reuse, recycling and minimal usage; selection of an optimal structural system and structural optimisation; and optimisation of construction operations. While several studies examined material selection and replacement in concrete, there is a paucity of studies investigating the replacement and implementation of high-strength re-bars to lower the carbon dioxide emissions in buildings. To fill this research gap, the purpose of this study involves calculating the emissions of carbon dioxide by applying high-strength reinforcement bars in three different types of buildings. The input-output analysis method was adopted to compute the emissions of carbon dioxide by using the yield strength and size. This study showed that the application of the high-strength re-bars is beneficial in reducing the input amount of materials, although the quantity of reinforcing bars on the development and splice increased. Furthermore, the application of high-strength deformed bars is also advantageous as a means of carbon dioxide reduction in the studied structural systems.

This. interest is driven partly by the recent adoption in Canada of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED (R)) Green Building Rating System and partly by a greater general awareness of environmental issues. Designers are beginning to look at how to incorporate reused steel components into construction projects, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions by saving on primary steel production. However, although some designers are willing to redesign their projects to make use of available reclaimed structural steel components, it is often difficult to identify suitable materials in the local area at the appropriate time in the life of a project. A limiting factor is that designers, construction companies, and others perceive a lack of a well-established and easily available mechanism for exchange of reclaimed components.

The study involved building simple causal networks to explain each of 171 cases of problematic reuse described in unstructured interviews with 50 designers and design managers. Most reuse problems concerned transfer that was inhibited in some way, although error and unexpected effort in the reuse process was also a significant outcome. Many of the causes lying behind these problems were local (such as unprecedented client requirements). But many were more general and structural. For instance, reuse was often precluded by differences in preference among designers, or among clients, and these differences appeared to arise from reinforcing feedback effects, which in turn arose from limitations of human inference-like insensitivity to sampling variability and confirmation bias. Reuse was also precluded by engineering problems, such as the combinatorial properties of constraints, which meant, in some instances, component designs could almost never be transferred between applications without extensive modification. In almost all cases, reuse was made problematic by a combination of factors ranging across several categories. Designers' motivations to innovate, for instance, only inhibited reuse because the environment they worked in led them to expect that existing designs would be deficient, and because they had different preferences from the original designer.",10.1080/095448299261335,0.0

Geometric characterization is demonstrated in this article to have a key role to play in the decision process for each case of potential steel reuse, because it is necessary for identifying unknown in situ member sizes and assembly geometries, and for quantifying uncertainty when assessing the reliability of a structure. Without automation of this analysis, it is speculated that such a detailed decision making process would not be feasible. The key role of geometric characterization is demonstrated in this article through a series of remote, 3D imaging experiments and reliability analyses. The reliability analysis demonstrated that automated geometric identification using an algorithm developed for the current study results in a 56% reduction in capacity when compared to similar new steel members. Alternatively, more manual methods of remote geometry detection resulted in only a 2% reduction in capacity. It is concluded that semi-automated geometric characterization has the potential to support increased steel reuse through reduced identification costs and improved reliability. A new set of methods and an understanding of their utility in making reuse more attractive through reduced costs and improved reliability is thus contributed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This is because RFID can stimulate the reuse of construction components and reduce their wastage, hence addressing sustainability issues in the construction sector. To test the plausibility of that idea, this study explores the potential pre-conditions for RFID to facilitate construction components reuse, and develops a guidance for promoting their redistribution back to the supply chain. It also looks at how integrating RFID with Building Information Modelling (BIM) can possibly be a valuable extension of its capabilities, providing the opportunity for tracked components to be incorporated into new structures in an informed, sound way. A preliminary assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the RFID technology is presented in order to depict its current and future potential in promoting construction components' sustainable lifecycle management, while emphasis has been laid on capturing their technical, environmental, economic and social value. Findings suggest that the collection of the right amount of information at the design-construction-deconstruction-reuse-disposal stage is crucial for RFID to become a successful innovation in the construction sector. Although a number of limitations related to the technical operability and recycling of RFID tags seem to currently hinder its uptake for structural components' lifecycle management, future technological innovations could provide solutions that would enable it to become a mainstream practice. Taken together these proposals advocate that the use of RFID and its integration with BIM can create the right environment for the development of new business models focused on sustainable resource management. These models may then unlock multiple values that are otherwise dissipated in the system. If the rapid technological development of RFID capability can be allied to policy interventions that control and manage its uptake along the supply chain, the sustainable lifecycle management of construction components could be radically enhanced.

Transportable modules will ease the process of returning the modules to the factory for reuse and recycling of structural steel at the end of their lifetime. A previous comparison between the proposed case studies has shown that the off-grid case can reduce the global warming potential by 76% in Shanghai when compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Generally, there is only a limited number of studies of container buildings with a simulation of the annual energy need in the literature. Particularly there is a lack of studies of residential buildings designed for off-grid operation. This study expands a previous study of the case buildings by improved control strategies in TRNSYS to reduce the required PV capacity and thereby the embodied emissions. For instance, thermal storage has been included to reduce the amount of dumped energy. Also, ventilation and indoor temperature have been controlled based on ambient temperature, state of charge, day, and time. In cold climates, Photovoltaic thermal (PVT), floor heating, and a generator have been added to increase the heating load. The results show that providing thermal comfort in the heating season is the main challenge, both because of the lower coefficient of performance for the heat pump and due to the lower PV generation. According to the predicted effects of climate change, the energy need for space heating is predicted to be reduced by on average 23% towards 2050 for the five climate zones in China which are considered, which would make it easier to provide thermal comfort. The current study helps to provide a reference to lower the costs for planning and improve the quality. The study is significant because China, who account for about 50% of new construction globally, is targeting to increase its prefabricated construction by 30% within ten years. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is still a lack of biomass-based thermal insulating material, which should possess a characteristic of easily preparation but high thermal insulation performance. Herein, we developed an eco-friendly thermal insulation material by firstly pre-pressing sawdust powder into packed bed and then carbonizing the sawdust bed into porous carbon bed. The influences of the bed structure, environmental temperatures and humidity on the thermal conductivity of the prepared beds were firstly investigated. Results turn out that the carbonized pine sawdust packed (CPP) bed could have a low thermal conductivity of about 0.062 Wm(-1) K-1. A high intrinsic porosity of sawdust particle, high porosity of bed, and spherical shape of pores in the CPPs are preferred for reducing the thermal conductivity. Moreover, the prepared CPPs not only possess hydrophobicity but also show excellent reusability and structural stability. The thermal conductivity of CPPs can be fully recovered without obvious structure collapse, if dried again after placed under a relative humidity of 60% for more than 24 h. Importantly, the CPPs has excellent flame-retardant and smoke-free property because of the carbonization treatment in the preparation, and it can self-extinguish within 6 s in the vertical burning test. This work provides a facile and sustainable strategy to manufacture thermal insulation material from recycling waste bioresources, which has potential for future energy saving in buildings.

Conversely positing that economics is a primary barrier, we investigated, characterized, and described nontechnical socio-political barriers to realizing wastewater resource recovery. Principal actors in the Pacific NW region of the U.S. (representing a progressive populace facing stringent water quality regulations) were interviewed. Results revealed that economics were, indeed, the primary barrier to implementation/expansion of the WRRF concept. Consistent throughout interviews was a prevalent sense that the cost of doing something (different) was a principal consideration in resource recovery actions/policies. Moreover, economics drives decisions, and 95% the bottom line is money. Show return on investment, it will get people's attention. Who pays was also a concern: Government isn't going to pay. The states and Federal government won't give any grants, and we can't raise rates. Applying business case evaluations was seen as a pathway to actualizing resource recovery. Most encouragingly, the consensus was that resource recovery is a necessary future paradigm, and that real barriers are surmountable.",10.1021/acs.est.7b00363,0.0

The results of the construction phase show that the contribution of digital fabrication process in fairly significant to the overall result. The end-of-life study demonstrated that even within the low reclaim rate of elements, the reuse scenario produces less environmental burden than the disposal, however in some figures it can be less performant than the initial structure.

The integrated lifetime engineering methodology concerns the development and use of technical performance parameters to guarantee, that the structures fulfil through the life cycle the requirements arising from human conditions, economy, cultural, social and ecological considerations. This is called the lifetime quality. The lifetime engineering includes: investment planning and decision making, integrated lifetime design, integrated lifetime management, maintenance, repair and rehabilitation (MR&R) planning, reuse, recycling and disposal. In order to realise the lifetime engineering we need new design and management processes, planning and design methods and modelling of long term performance of materials and structures.",,

Even though China governments proposed a series of local standards, the most of the existing China's rural sewage discharge standards are still similar to urban discharge standards. This research analyses comprehensively the data of rural sewage discharge standards in the 31 provinces and cities in China in terms of grade and indicator, and forms a structural framework for the formulation and revised standards in rural areas of China. In the formulation, we use 2 components, end-use and environmental capacity, to reflect local characteristics of the grades and indicators, and also propose the methods of combining discharge standards with relevant water quality standards to save energy. And we also use the mathematical model to illustrate environmental capacity in different regions. The paper shows the great potential in guiding the design of discharge standards formulation and revision for rural wastewater treatment in China and other developing countries as well.

It has resulted in heavy economic, social, and environmental losses. Undoubtedly, the first step to cope with droughts and their consequences is to have an accurate understanding of droughts and their effects on different aspects by specifying the related strategies and approaches in this regard. Given the importance of this issue, the present study was conducted to investigate how to model farmers' perception of consequences of drought through structural equation modeling in Birjand Township, Iran. All farmer households living in rural areas of Birjand (a city in the Iranian province of Southern Khorasan) composed the statistical population of this study (N=6057). As many as 200 households were chosen for the study by using Bartlett's table. In total, 20 villages were considered as the target districts using stratified random sampling. The results showed that the most important consequences of droughts understood by the farmers are their economic (0.341), environmental (0.261), and social (0.138) consequences. The highest indirect effects on the farmers' perception of consequences of drought in Birjand were: reduced income (0.286), increased bank debts (0.272), reduced purchasing power (0.265), and the wells, aqueducts and springs that have dried (0.224) respectively. In this regard, measures such as supporting the investment and entrepreneurship, granting banking facilities and credits, governmental oversight on water withdrawals from groundwater sources, development of infrastructures and irrigation and water supply networks, reuse of wastewater, identification and promotion of products compatible with saline and unconventional waters, development of support services and social security for rural communities and development and promotion of drought insurance are proposed in order to reduce the consequences of drought.",10.15666/aeer/1601_521534,0.0

However, in the UK, work by Sansom and Avery (2014) suggests a picture of declining levels of reuse. This paper explores why this is the case by identifying the practical barriers to structural steel reuse through a series of semi structured interviews with UK construction industry members. Whilst there were many identified barriers, five practical barriers were prioritised as being most significant: cost, availability/storage, no client demand, traceability and supply chain gaps/lack of integration. These contrast with those most commonly identified in global literature: cost, supply chain gaps/integration, risk, jointing technique, composite construction and time for deconstruction; with only two overlaps: cost and supply chain gaps/integration. Many of the barriers from literature have a technical focus (reducing salvage yield rather than completely preventing reuse) differing from the largely systemic barriers that the interviews prioritised. These systemic barriers will need to be dealt with first to increase reuse rates. This will require a coordinated approach across the UK construction supply chain. Building on interview insights, this paper proposes four mechanisms to overcome these systemic barriers: (1) the creation of a database of suppliers/reused section availability, (2) a demonstration of client demand (3) technical guidance and education for the construction industry and (4) government leadership. Together these mechanisms would improve reuse rates in the UK, reduce the embodied emissions of the built environment and play a crucial role in meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.

24,"Dauda, JA; Ajayi, SO",Understanding the impediments to sustainable structural retrofit of existing buildings in the UK,Article,,"Structural retrofit of existing buildings for reuse remained one of the key steps toward decarbonisation of the existing housing stocks in the UK. This implies that any structural retrofitting procedure should aim at sustainability by ensuring net reduction in energy use with minimum cost, environmental and social impact. However, several factors impede the attainment of sustainable structural retrofit programs. In this study, quantitative data collection and exploratory factor analysis were used to investigate the factors that impede achieving sustainability in structural retrofitting of existing buildings. The study conducted a review of pertinent literature to draw up a list of potential impediments to sustainable structural retrofit. The lists were used to form Likert scale questionnaire that was administered to 126 professionals within the built environment sector in the UK. The data collected were subjected to reliability analysis and exploratory factor analysis using the SPSS IBM Statistics v24. The analysis revealed that there are four groups of barriers that impede sustainability in structural retrofitting of existing buildings. These are (i) cultural barriers involving factors that are characterised by human behaviour and interest; (ii) economic barriers involving cost functions; (iii) technical knowledge barriers involving education & skills factors and (iv) regulatory barriers involving legislation and policies around retrofitting old buildings. The findings of this study contribute to the broader discussion of sustainability within the built environment by increasing awareness of the key barriers to overcome to promote sustainable structural retrofit of existing buildings.",10.1016/j.jobe.2022.105168,0.0
166,"Bertolini, M; Guardigli, L",Upcycling shipping containers as building components: an environmental impact assessment,Article,,"Purpose The introduction of shipping containers in the trading system has increased world economic growth exponentially. The main drawback of this linear economy consists in the accumulation of empty containers in import-based countries. Designers throughout the world are working with intermodal containers for environmental purposes, often employing them as building components. This research aims to evaluate the environmental impact of a container dwelling in comparison with similar steel and X-Lam structures. Method In order to estimate the effective sustainability of container structures, a comparative LCA has been undertaken. A cut-off approach was adopted focusing on Global Warming Potential (GWP), Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP), Acidification Potential (AP) and Eutrophication Potential (EP). To ensure reliable comparisons, a functional unit with combined spatial and thermal requirements has been defined. The proposed unit includes a total floor surface of 206.6 m(2)and transmittance requirements in accordance with IECC standards. Three scenarios have been identified to address cold, temperate and hot climates within import-oriented places: Vancouver, Durban and Chennai. For hot climates the functional unit has been implemented with a minimum Periodic Thermal Transmittance. Results and discussion It can be generally stated that the use of shipping containers as building components leads to overall environmental benefits compared to steel and X-Lam structures within the boundaries of this analysis. The main advantages of container structures are related to easy reclaim of structural materials, creative reuse and shorter construction schedules. While the use of containers as building components demonstrated the best environmental advantages for cold climates, those benefits can be overturned by improper choices of thermal masses for hot and temperate climates. Conclusions Empty containers are accumulated worldwide as a result of the linear nature of the trading system. With an upcycling process, the stored steel contained within abandoned freight containers is introduced into the circular economy of the building sector. Therefore, shipping containers can be regarded as waste objects that can be used as building components thus avoiding the use of steel from other processes or the extraction of virgin materials during the product stage. This upcycling process provides for each 200-m(2)new house a general global warming potential reduction ranging from 20 to 25 tons of CO(2)equivalent compared to steel frames and 10 to 26 tons reduction compared to x-lam structures in cold and hot climates, while resulting in an increment of + 3 tons in a temperate scenario.",10.1007/s11367-020-01747-3,0.0

This study investigates and compares which product design strategies (from routinely design, structural optimization, industrial design and systematic innovation) are most used by students and professional designers to implement different CE strategies (i.e., waste reduction, reuse, remanufacturing, recycling and biodegradability). Students' data were collected from year projects and MSc degree theses based on real industrial case studies and carried out in two Italian engineering universities, while those of professional designers, were collected from selected scientific articles. Among the main outcomes emerged that the design strategies deriving from systematic innovation were preferred by students quite clearly. The design strategies referred to industrial design, e.g., user-centered design and timeless design were preferred by professional designers. The design strategies related to routine design, i.e., materials substitution, reducing resources and energy consumption, and structural optimization, were indistinctly used by both students and professional designers. The obtained results and their discussion can be useful during eco-design teaching to show the main gaps that students should fill in comparison with professional designers.",10.3390/su14031122,0.0

Steel beams are well suited to reuse, but are difficult to reuse when connected compositely to concrete slabs using welded studs. A demountable connection would allow composite performance but also permit reuse of both components at end-of-life. Three composite beams, of 2 m, 10 m and 5 m length, are constructed using M20 bolts as demountable shear connectors. The beams are tested in three-, six- and four-point bending, respectively. The former two are loaded to service, unloaded, demounted and reassembled; all three are tested to failure. The results show that all three have higher strengths than predicted using Eurocode 4. The longer specimens have performance similar to previously published comparable welded-connector composite beam results. This suggests that demountable composite beams can be safely used and practically reused, thus reducing carbon emissions. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Synthetic stormwater was placed in permeable pavement reservoir models filled with dolomite aggregate or quartzite aggregate or control reservoirs with no aggregate. The influence of residence time was investigated by monitoring stored water quality for up to 144 h. Conductivity and pH increased in both aggregate-filled reservoirs. Total suspended solids and turbidity also increased in the aggregate-filled reservoirs, before falling to levels significantly lower than the control reservoirs. Levels of phosphorous and organic nitrogen were significantly lower in the aggregate-filled reservoirs after 144 h. Total zinc, copper and lead were reduced by 94-99% in the aggregate-filled reservoirs compared with the controls after 144 h storage.",10.1680/wama.2011.164.7.361,0.0

It focuses on environmental tax revenues and tax expenditures since the 2014 Public Financial Reform (PFR), according to pro- or anti-environmental orientation. The research carried out combines the study of the regulation of the selected tax instruments, their classification and the empirical analysis of the tax revenues and tax expenditures associated with the different taxes over the periods of validity of the taxes and benefits studied, using the databases of the CIAT and the Mexican SHCP. A critical analysis addresses the weak environmental function of environment-related taxes (IEPS, ISAN horizontal ellipsis ), as well as the late implementation and reduced impact of the carbon and pesticide taxes introduced in 2014. The evolution of tax incentives and expenditure is thoroughly examined by examining both environmental measures, which have evolved positively but within a very reduced level, and the most prevalent tax expenditure measures, with harmful impacts to the environment. Based on the results obtained, long-term structural changes in the Mexican tax system are suggested. As for the short to medium term, profound changes in tax expenditure are proposed to eliminate of those tax benefits harmful to the environment, introduce of tax benefits for circular activities (e.g., repairing, reusing and remanufacturing) and broaden the carbon tax base and rates. The conclusions include recommendations for moving towards a systemic green tax reform that assists the transformation towards a sustainable economy.",10.3390/su132011269,0.0
