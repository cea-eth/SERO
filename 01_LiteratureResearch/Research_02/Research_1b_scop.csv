Currently, BIM has been extensively used in both the sketch design (sketch) and detailed design (design) stages. Due to different purposes and different BIM tools, the reusability of sketch BIM models in the design stage is still challenging. To address this issue, this study proposes a building element identification scheme using a segmentation-aggregation strategy, termed EI-SA. Since Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) is the international standard of BIM, the EI-SA is built according to the IFC specification. Firstly, the element identification Problem is formally defined, followed by the overall framework of the EI-SA. Then, a presentation-level BIM segmentation algorithm is developed to divide a sketch BIM model into slices of geometric representations. Thirdly, a representation aggregation scheme is proposed to solve the element identification problem. The representation aggregation scheme employs a triangle-triangle intersection to detect the geometric connection and an object recognition algorithm to identify elements. Finally, experiments were conducted on several sketch BIM models. The experiment results showed that the EI-SA identified 82.22% elements on average, which verified the effectiveness of the EI-SA. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to solve the building element identification problem according to IFC. The proposed EI-SA will bridge the gap between sketch BIM models and design BIM models, smooth the reusability of data from the sketch stage to downstream stages, and improve the design efficiency by avoiding the re-designing of building elements. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building information modelling (BIM); Design BIM; Element identification; Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Object recognition; Sketch BIM","Bridges; Building components; Life cycle; Object recognition; Reusability; Structural design; Building Information Modelling; Geometric representation; Identification approach; Identification problem; Industrial foundation class; International standards; Object recognition algorithm; Segmentation algorithms; Architectural design; algorithm; architectural design; building; modeling",Article,Scopus

Some of them were abandoned, some buildings were reused and some were reused together with their environment. In terms of conservation it is crucial to give the building a new function in order to help it survive, at the same time however, one has to be careful not to significantly change original characteristics of the building and not to break its connection with history. Due to the scale of the factories, the industrial heritage has to be protected together with its area. The ongoing urban transformation in Istanbul affects the visibility of these preserved examples of industrial heritage. In addition, researches draw attention to the probable risk of an earthquake in the near future in Istanbul, where several disasters have happened in previous history. This paper, discusses the conservation and sustainability of industrial heritages which are located in the area between Yedikule, on the border of the historical peninsula and Küçükçekmece Lake by the Marmara Sea, Turkey. The industrial heritage in the region concerned was evaluated in terms of its location, scale, existing structures, its current use and its structural and constructional features, taking the disaster risk into account. Four samples were evaluated, using data derived from on-site observations of the materials’ characteristics, the technology and structural systems the current condition of the building elements and their decoration features. The study emphasizes the necessity of protecting industrial heritage in Istanbul. © 2019, RILEM.","Conservation; Disaster; Earthquake; Industrial heritage; Istanbul; Sustainability",,Book Chapter,Scopus

The distribution profile was constructed with the material-use data collected from 13 high-rise concrete office buildings in Hong Kong. Results indicated that the average carbon footprint of the superstructure of an office building was 215.1kg CO2/m22. External walls and upper-floor construction had the highest CO2 footprint, followed by suspended ceilings and finishes. These three elements altogether accounted for an average of 84.2% of the CO2 footprint associated with the superstructure. Also, this study evaluated the emissions-reduction impacts of five different material-use options over a 60-year lifespan. Among all the studied options, the most effective option was to maintain 15-30% of the existing structural and nonstructural building elements as this could reduce the CO2 footprint by 17.3%. Diverting construction wastes to recycling could reduce the CO2 footprint by 5.9%. Reusing resources and importing regional materials could only reduce the CO2 footprint by 3.2% and 3.1%, respectively. In contrast, the CO2 footprint would be increased by 5% if offsite fabricated materials were used in facades, slabs, and partition walls. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Major simplifications are made to document these structures efficiently. However, these simplified geometric models provide less reliable results. Therefore, the need exists for more realistic models. Additionally, the exchangeability of information between varying parties is paramount. Hence, the construction elements should be defined in a Building Information Model (BIM). This allows users to reuse the model, allowing the distribution of information throughout the project. The goal of our research is to create a realistic BIM model of a complex heritage roof structure employing dense point clouds. The comparison of our complex geometric model to a traditional wire-frame model proves that our approach provides more reliable results in terms of geometry and structural behaviour. Our work covers the acquisition, the modelling and the structural analysis of timber roof structures. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","BIM; Cultural heritage; Modelling; Structural analysis; Timber roof structures","Architectural design; Geometry; Historic preservation; Models; Roof coverings; Structural analysis; Timber; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction elements; Cultural heritages; Geometric modeling; Manual measurements; Structural behaviour; Timber roofs; Wire frame models; Roofs",Conference Paper,Scopus
