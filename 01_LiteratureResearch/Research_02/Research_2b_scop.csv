The network visualization and other approaches based on the Web of Science (WOS) database and the patterns of research interactions were explored in 1879 academic publications using co-occurrence and co-citation investigations. Significant publications, conferences, influential authors, countries, organizations, and funding agencies have been recognized. Our study demonstrates that BIM, IoT, and DT in construction, Heritage BIM (HBIM), Smart Contracts, BIM, and Ontology, and VR and AR in BIM and DT are the main study themes. Finally, several prospective areas for future study are identified, including BIM and Metaverse technology, BIM and Artificial Intelligence (AI), Metaheuristic algorithms for optimization purposes in BIM, and the Circular Economy with BIM and IoT. © 2022 by the authors.","bibliometric; Building Information Modeling (BIM); Digital Twins (DT); Internet of Things (IoT); network analysis; systematic literature review (SLR)",,Review,Scopus

A vast amount of primary resources is spent during the construction of buildings, which uses 50% of raw materials taken from earth. The energy needed to heat, cool, illuminate, connect the fabric of the built environment contributes 36% to global energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions. At the same time, the building industry is one of the most fragmented, decen-tralized and diverse industries with nearly 3 million workers organized in 800.000 predominantly small enterprises. The vast spectrum of trades and sub-domains along with the diversity of its products ranging from residential buildings to tun-nels and bridges leads to a wide spectrum of information exchanged in temporary processes with fragile value chains. At the same time, the building sector as a whole is trailing in many productivity indices and in its state of digitalization. The potential to save energy and to contribute to the reduction of the car-bon footprint from the sector can be approached from a number of different angles: Improved design and planning for the few new and the many existing buildings; re-use and circular economy for the materials involved and synergetic effects through increased vertical and horizontal integration of processes, and subsystems. All this requires the integration of knowledge domains. 1.2 Semantic DTs in the Built Environment The individual cyberphysical sub-systems that comprise the built environment from individual buildings to vast and highly connected infrastructure networks including traffic, energy, water and waste networks, are designed, operated and maintained in completely separated, heterogeneous information silos with a very low rate of digitalization. Representing, monitoring, simulating and optimizing even of single nodes in these interconnected, multi-layered networks using dig-ital twins has only just begun. Within a single domain of these networks such as an individual building, a road-network or bridge, the current and past sys-tem states, their long-term monitoring and improvement requires comprehensive semantic models digital twin models. Such models are still in their infancy. Cur-rent and evolving information models are still mostly designed to capture static as-planned individual lifecycle stages, have bespoke and disparate insular solu-tions and little to no vertical and horizontal connectivity with other nodes in the network. Information exchange models for different aspects at various levels of granularity from geospatial superstructures (GIS) to building components (BIM) often have hundreds or even thousands of semantic entities and the sheer size of the structured vocabularies to describe products range in the tens of thousands of concepts which often differ on national or even regional levels. 1.3 Use cases and examples In the presentation an overview of ongoing research, development and standard-ization efforts regarding the creation, integration and interoperability of seman-tic Digital Twins for the built environment is provided. Concrete challenges and solution approaches of past and ongoing research from different use cases and application domains of Semantic Digital Twins for-the assessment and energy refurbishing of residential buildings-monitoring and predictive maintenance of bridges-road network interoperability with Linked Data across European borders are used to illustrate these challenges. These include the semantic lifting of legacy data models, the alignment and integration of vast domain vocabularies, multi-modal integration of heterogeneous status information (sensor, images, measure-ments) and ongoing efforts to create reference frameworks for semantically rich Digital Twins in the built environment.

In comparison to green-field construction projects, adaptive reuse projects require distinct stages, definition of interfaces, decision gates, and planning methods in order to secure the success of the building project. Unfortunately, little research has been done regarding establishing feasible systems for the planning, assessment, and management of adaptive reuse projects, leading to underperforming building projects outcomes. Interface management (IM) can improve renovation projects outcomes by defining appropriate ways to identify, record, monitor, and track project interfaces. IM has the potential of bringing cost and time benefits during adaptive reuse projects execution. The aim of this study is to develop a reference framework for implementing IM for adaptive reuse projects. First, the inefficiencies of redevelopment projects are explained inside of a circular economy (CE) context. Second, an ontology of IM for adaptive reuse projects is defined based on the current barriers to adaptive reuse and the most common interface problems in construction projects. Third, the defined ontology is expanded through a case study by showing examples of adaptive reuse barriers on a case project, and how IM could have been part of the solution for these problems. Finally, this study concludes with the suggestions on interface management systems (IMS) implementation for future adaptive reuse projects. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptive reuse of buildings; Barriers in adaptive reuse projects; Circular economy; Interface management system; Interface problems in construction projects",,Article,Scopus

It suggests building material passports as a data source for the materials to be circulated and then integrates them by means of Linked Data.A common language is proposed to combine and re-use the material data in the CE with the creation of two ontologies: Circular Exchange Ontology (CEO) and the Circular Materials and Activities Ontology (CAMO). The ontologies annotate materials under a CE classification scheme and describe the elements required for material exchange to occur: actors, the activities they perform and the referents of these activities (resources, products, tools and waste).An evaluation of the ontologies is made by means of use case-driven SPARQL queries. Further, a wide-scale evaluation addresses how a decentralized data ecosystem can enable users to publish information and dynamically interact with different repositories to exchange materials. Results indicate that these ontologies can foster a circulation medium between diverse construction industry resources. Future work contemplates validation of both ontologies in a real-world-setting with computer scientists and companies in the construction sector in the Benelux area. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London",,"Building materials; Construction industry; Life cycle; Semantics; Circular economy; Classification scheme; Common languages; Computer scientists; Construction sectors; Material circulation; Real world setting; Semantic technologies; Ontology",Conference Paper,Scopus
