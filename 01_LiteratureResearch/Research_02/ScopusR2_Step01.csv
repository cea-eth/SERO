However, there is uncertainty about which urban heat mitigation strategies (UHMSs) can provide better solutions for a specific urban context. There is a compelling need for local governments to automate the decision-making process and optimise the combination of UHMSs to maximise the mitigation outcomes for their cities. We develop a novel decision-making framework that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into urban heat mitigation in the built environment to enable an automated process of decision making. The novel decision-making framework comprises: the ontology-based knowledge representation of UHMSs and their relationships with urban contexts and performance assessment to share knowledge in urban heat mitigation domain; sensitivity analysis of the environmental, social and economic performance of UHMSs to get key variables for UHMSs; and genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimisation of UHMSs. The novel decision-making framework enables generating the context-based optimised UHMS combinations to support local governments’ decision-making. The research outcomes will advance interdisciplinary knowledge about using AI techniques in the decision-making process for urban heat mitigation. © 2022","Multi-objective optimisation; Sensitive planning and design variables; Urban contexts, Ontology; Urban heat mitigation strategies","Automation; Behavioral research; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Sensitivity analysis; Context ontology; Decision-making frameworks; Design variables; Mitigation strategy; Multi-objectives optimization; Planning and design; Sensitive planning and design variable; Urban context; Urban context, ontology; Urban heat mitigation strategy; Multiobjective optimization; artificial intelligence; decision making; genetic algorithm; knowledge; local government; optimization; planning process; urban design; urban planning; article; built environment; decision making; genetic algorithm; government; heat; human; multiobjective optimization; ontology; sensitivity analysis",Article

The ontology can be useful to create a knowledge management system for different experts involved in the process of the building renovation, to extend the information and stretch the domain from the individual building to the environment. Knowledge about what entities and attributes to select is captured based on literature and investigating the pilot demonstration sites. Such an ontology can help to structure the surrounding data to support processes in different stages of the renovation. The final goal is to support planners in decision making process namely in site planning and pre-data collection phase, energy modeling, comfort analysis and so on to control cost and quality. Moreover, it can be valuable in further studies of integrating data of various sources for construction purposes.

However, BIM has predominantly generated value in the design phase of a project, while the potential benefits in the construction phase have been disregarded for many years and are now gaining importance. Trending advancements try to utilize existing BIM data, e.g by linking a digital building model with planning efforts of the construction project and create new knowledge to improve construction. In this paper, we are interested in exploring how semantic models and Linked Building Data (LBD) can support value creation in the construction phase. The presented use case tries to answer the question how the planning of Temporary Construction Items (TCIs) can be improved by semantically describing and classifying TCIs in an ontology that allows to utilize TCI information with BIM data. TCIs only experience little attention in the current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the outcome of a project. Thus, the creation of an ontology in this field shall lead to a better and more automated consideration of TCIs in construction planning. Here, we follow the recommendation of the W3C - LBD community group to extend or develop new ontologies and propose the TCI ontology3 as the main contribution. We first introduce the TCI ontology and its relation to other ontologies. Then we demonstrate the value of the ontology by answering competency questions and finally provide a proof of concept of planning TCIs by utilizing the new ontology. The proposal of the TCI ontology is accompanied by a second ontology for Location-Based Scheduling (LBS) to consider the time dimension of planning. The main focus, however, lies on the development and presentation of the TCI ontology whereas the LBS ontology will be further developed in future research. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",BIM; Linked building data; Ontology; Temporary construction items,Architectural design; Classification (of information); Construction; Construction industry; Semantics; Building Information Modelling; Construction phase; Design phase; Linked building data; Location based; Modeling data; Ontology's; Site planning; Temporary construction; Temporary construction item; Ontology,Conference Paper

The methodology uses the knowledge representation of construction projects based on an ontology. Meta-data are used to describe the conceptual structure of the project knowledge. The concept of views is used to answer particular queries from different domains. A general methodology is under development to support queries about a particular construction project from different user perspectives based on heterogeneous construction data sources in a dynamic environment. The research is composed of two major parts: (1) organize the heterogeneous construction data into a tree structure; and (2) retrieve information and obtain domain views by specifying the ways of traversing the tree.

Existing tools that assist structural designers in reducing EI are mainly software for assessing EI of material consumption, while EI happening in construction phase, which is related to engineering quantities, is out of the assessment scope. To better support structural designers in achieving a balance between structural requirements and environmental protection, this paper builds an ontology framework for assessing the embodied EI of building structures. The ontology is based on a building environmental performance assessment model-BEPAS, and takes account of EI related both to material consumption and construction activities.

However, in the application process of forward design, there is a lack of standardized implementation guidance and mature technical support, leading to many problems such as a redundancy of model information, heterogeneity of data information, and low efficiency of transmission. Based on this, this paper proposes a model view delivery method of forward design for prefabricated buildings. Firstly, a simplified assembly model and an assembly knowledge model are designed and extended with IFC (Industry Foundation Classes), then we realize the knowledge visualization expression by combining with an ontology semantic system. For the model view of a prefabricated building domain, this paper realizes the reusable concept module by ontology IDM (Information Delivery Manual) and properties selection of knowledge graphs, and then completes the model view delivery through data mapping and IfcDoc (Ifc Documentation Generator) tool output. Finally, the implementation model of information delivery management for forward design is built with model view delivery as the central link. © 2022 by the authors.",assembly model; BIM; forward design; knowledge graph; model view definition,,Article

However, within the context of information system practice in BIM, knowledge of cost estimation has not been represented, nor has it been integrated into the processes based on BIM. This paper intends to establish an innovative means of taking data from the BIM linked to a project, and using it to create the necessary items for a bill of quantity that will enable cost estimation to be undertaken for the project. Our framework is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implementation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). In order to achieve this, a prototype is created that allows a cost item for the bill of quantity to be spontaneously generated, by means of the semantic web ontology and a forward chain algorithm. Within this paper, ‘cost items’ signify the elements included in a bill of quantity, including details of their description, quantity and price. As a means of authenticating the process being developed, the authors of this work effectively implemented it in the production of cost items. In addition, the items created were contrasted with those produced by specialists. For this reason, this innovative framework introduces the possibility of a new means of applying semantic web ontology and forward chain algorithm to construction professional practice resulting in automatic cost estimation. These key outcomes demonstrate that, decoupling the professional practice into three key components of syntax, semantics and pragmatics can provide tangible benefits to domain user. © 2016",BIM; Computer-aided professional practice; Cost estimation; Expert system; IFC; Ontology; Rule-based; Semantic,Architectural design; Chains; Construction industry; Costs; Expert systems; Knowledge based systems; Ontology; Professional aspects; Semantic Web; Semantics; Syntactics; Bill of quantities; Collaborative process; Construction professionals; Cost estimations; Information types; Professional practices; Rule based; Semantic Web ontologies; Cost estimating,Article

This paper aims to develop a new information management method to cope with the risk problems involved in dealing with such data, based on domain ontologies of the construction industry, to help manage PPP risks, share and reuse risk knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: Risk knowledge concepts are acquired and summarized through PPP failure cases and an extensive literature review to establish a domain framework for risk knowledge using ontology technology to help manage PPP risks. Findings: The results indicate that the risk ontology is capable of capturing key concepts and relationships involved in managing PPP risks and can be used to facilitate knowledge reuse and storage beneficial to risk management. Research limitations/implications: The classes in the risk knowledge ontology model constructed in this research do not yet cover all the information in PPP project risks and need to be further extended. Moreover, only the framework and basic methods needed are developed, while the construction of a working ontology model and the relationship between implicit and explicit knowledge is a complicated process that requires repeated modifications and evaluations before it can be implemented. Practical implications: The ontology provides a basis for turning PPP risk information into risk knowledge to allow the effective sharing and communication of project risks between different project stakeholders. It can also have the potential to help reduce the dependence on subjectivity by mining, using and storing tacit knowledge in the risk management process. Originality/value: The apparent suitability of the nine classes of PPP risk knowledge (project model, risk type, risk occurrence stage, risk source, risk consequence, risk likelihood, risk carrier, risk management measures and risk case) is identified, and the proposed construction method and steps for a complete domain ontology for PPP risk management are unique. A combination of criteria- and task-based evaluations is also developed for assessing the PPP risk ontology for the first time. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Domain ontology; Project management; Public–private partnership; Risk knowledge; Risk management; Rule-based reasoning,Construction industry; Digital storage; Information management; Ontology; Project management; Risk assessment; Construction projects; Domain ontologies; Ontology model; Ontology-based; Project risk; Public/private partnerships; Risk knowledge; Risk ontologies; Risks management; Rule-based reasoning; Risk management,Article

Systems are needed to explain to communities the various elements of projects, who is sponsoring them, who has the decision powers to develop and approve such components and, more importantly, the impacts of various design options on sustainability. This paper developed an ontology for sustainability in highway construction. An ontology is a conceptual semantic model that attempts to capture human knowledge (both explicit and tacit) in a consistent manner. Ontologies include three main elements: a taxonomy (common vocabulary presented in concept trees), set of relationships (linking concepts across trees) and axioms (limitation/constraints on the behavior of concepts). The ontology was used to develop a portal for broadcasting highway design features to local communities. By browsing through the portal, a user can learn about project elements, the impacts of each element on sustainability issues, who is sponsoring such element and what efforts have been made to reduce any impacts of such elements on local communities.",Community Involvement; E-Society; Highway construction; Sustainability,Construction industry; Information technology; Mathematical models; Portals; Semantics; Software prototyping; Sustainable development; Community involvement; E-society; Highway construction; Sustainability; Highway systems,Conference Paper

Based on a critical review of Building Product Modelling, including the development of standards for exchange and the features of over 150 AEC/O (Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operation) tools and digital models, a methodological framework is proposed for improvements to both BIM tools and schemata. The features relevant to the framework were studied using a conceptual process model and a 'BIM System-of-Systems' (BIM-SoS) model. The development, implementation, and use of the BIM Schema are analysed from the standpoint of standardisation. The results embrace the requirements for a BIM research methodology, with an example of methods and procedures, an R&D review with critique, and a multi-standpoint framework for developments with concrete recommendations, supported by BIM metrics, upon which the progress of tools, models, and standards may be measured, evaluated, streamlined, and judged. It is also proposed that any BIM Schema will never be 'completed' but should be developed as evolutionary ontology by 'segmented standpoint models' to better account for evolving tools and AEC/O practices. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Unlike in the other fields, in the construction field, it is still a novel concept, probably because BM adaptation in the industry has not been sufficiently studied. Hence, the purpose of this study is to set a roadmap for the effective adaptation of the BM concept in the construction industry. Design/methodology/approach: To develop a roadmap, this study analysed BM literature through a comprehensive literature review by finding the BM research development stages using studies done in other fields and locating construction industry BM literature. Findings: No stage-wise development of BM research has taken place in the construction industry. The four BM research development stages, namely, defining BMs, listing BM components, describing BM components and modelling BM components as a business model ontology (BMO) in relation to the construction industry have to be followed for proper BM adaptation in the construction industry. Originality/value: This study provided an overview of and a roadmap for BM adaptation in the construction industry for the benefit of future researchers.

The results identified a large network of co-authors in this field to understand collaboration relationships. Over half the papers (53%) were published by the following three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The top co-occurring keywords were “project management” at which ontology facilitates knowledge management and information retrieval. When the time factor was taken into consideration, keywords naturally evolved from “project management” and “knowledge management” to “building information modeling” and “compliance control” with the successful adoption of information techniques in the construction industry.

The fragmentation of this information along the construction process can be addressed with the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM). One of the fundamental components of BIM is the development of information models. These models contain a defined and shared semantic structure that allows the simulation of real entities in a digital environment. However, the quality of this simulation is bounded by the limits of the instruments used for its development. The work presented in this paper is the development a rules-based system that makes inference upon ontologies obtained from IFC models to recognise real estates units and their destination of uses starting from building information models.

Using semantic systems in building these tools (along with database and/or AI-based systems) allows for more efficient representation of tacit knowledge. Such systems are based on a common ontology of the subject domain, where entities (such as actors, processes and products) are interlinked to represent the essence of the knowledge in the domain. The paper presents a taxonomy for building construction. The taxonomy includes 6000 concepts and was developed using OWL. It maps to existing classification systems to assure better coverage. The taxonomy is the first attempt to present building construction knowledge in a semantic way. It also represents the foundations developing ontology-based corporate memory systems. To demonstrate the role and contribution of the proposed taxonomy a prototypical ontology for building construction was developed. Furthermore, a framework for agent-based system for supporting semi-automatic generation of reports such as lessons learned, work forms, and meeting agendas. Such agents allow organizations to capture and document its knowledge (in a taxonomy-complaint format) and to feed back post-project knowledge into new ones through access to lessons learned and through pre-defined meeting agendas. Access to these reports is done through semantic search according to the proposed taxonomy. Future research will develop a formal ontology and further develop the framework and implement it in actual organizations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Similarly, in the construction industry, logistics operations are a crucial part that directly influence the construction operations. Construction operations management requires various stakeholders to collaborate through effective communication and prompt information sharing. However, logistics management in construction is often challenged by insufficient information management, lack of formalized information standards and poor information interoperability among heterogeneous systems. Semantic Web technologies advance information management support and improve information interoperability. In this research, we present a domain-level ontology as a common information reference for standardizing and integrating construction logistics information, and finally to improve the efficiency and transparency of logistics information management. The proposed ontology provides information interoperability between logistics management and construction workflow management. The ontology was evaluated by automatic consistency checking and answering the competency questions (CQs) via SPARQL queries. Furthermore, we used actual schedule and material delivery data of a construction project to evaluate the proposed ontology to see if it could support the material kitting logistics practice. We provide a valid ontology that is able support the logistics information management for the construction. The research is limited to providing a single example application of the ontology. Future research should focus on extending the ontology for different specific solutions to yield standardized information management for construction operations. © 2020 Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot.

Abundant studies have focused on cause and effect on fatalities or safety training system, and so on. Most of them on this issue have been emphasized the necessity and utilization of information, rather than how to exchange, share and transfer safety data efficiently in the construction industry. With this regard, this paper proposes the Social Network System for Sharing Construction Safety & Health Knowledge (SNSS), which utilizes state-of-the-art of semantic wiki web and ontology construction technologies for better communication and representation for construction safety information. The SNSS is developed on the basis of safety semantic wiki template (SSWT), which consists of the following three modules: 1) A Safety information module (SIM) which upload common accident and hazard information for sharing; 2) A Safety knowledge module (SKM) where the safety information is refined, confirmed and transferred to safety knowledge; 3) A Safety dissemination module (SDM) which allows its users to monitor, manage and retrieve safety information and knowledge easily. The SNSS is tested by a scenario of using falling accident information by which the potentials and limitations of the system were addressed.

In the case of healthcare facilities, where the policy environment is characterized by change on several fronts, fixed requirements could constrain their evolvability and sustainability. Future-proofing is a response to uncertainty whereby a physical structure is designed to respond to future changes in requirements, change of use, strategic perspectives, business drivers, new policies and changing climate. The paper investigates the causal powers that explain how and why future-proofing decisions achieve a sustainable outcome. A critical realist lens is adopted to develop a configurational perspective of future-proofing design evolution. Critical Realism's open systems ontology of social reality can account for the fact that outcomes are not predictable and can better explain the nature of causation in complex social interactions such as construction projects. A case study research design was conducted comprising in-depth interviews with healthcare construction professionals in a UK setting. The study contributes to the sustainability literature by offering four generative mechanisms of future-proofing decision making and how they contingently lead - or fail to lead - to future-proof outcomes.

Both two- and three-dimensional finite element models employing solid and shell elements with material, geometrical and interfacial non-linearity were established to examine the full range structural behaviour of composite beams. In this paper, two-dimensional finite element models employing plane stress elements are established to examine the structural behaviour of perforated composite beams, and shear connectors with non-linear deformation characteristics are incorporated into the models through the use of both vertical and horizontal springs. It is demonstrated that after careful calibration against test data, the finite element models are able to predict the load carrying capacities of composite beams with large rectangular web openings against 'Vierendeel' mechanism satisfactorily. Moreover, a number of important structural quantities such as local axial and shear forces together with local bending moments acting onto the composite and the steel tee sections at failure are obtained after data analyses. Together with the load carrying capacities, these quantities compare favourably with the values obtained from a design method proposed previously by the authors, and hence, this provides quantitative justification to the proposed design method. Furthermore, the finite element models provide detailed information on the structural behaviour of shear connectors along the beam length, such as the longitudinal shear forces, the pull-out forces as well as the slippage of the shear connectors. Based on the findings of the finite element modelling, a number of recommendations on the design and construction of perforated composite beams are suggested. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In contemplating the relationship between theory and practice throughout the life cycle of the built environment, along with the range of involved stakeholders; and illustrated by reference to the example of the contemporary 'workplace'; an ambivalent approach to theorizing at the local level of involved actors is proposed. In this approach, conceptualization of the built environment is based not upon early exclusive either/or choices between different theories and models, but rather upon inclusive both/and considerations. However, this does not mean that all are considered as equally valid in the outcomes of decision-making, and the role of power and politics is acknowledged within the process of negotiation of a 'good' outcome.

This study analyzed existing integration strategies and developed an ontology for integrating the data modeling standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) CityGML, IndoorGML, and SensorThings API. To cope with the broad definition of 'things' in the IoT, the proposed ontology supports multiple views of things, including the a-building-as-a-thing, a-room-as-a-thing, an-opening-as-a-thing, and a-device-as-a-thing views. Thus, the proposed ontology relates information from these three standards and supports semantic queries. We demonstrated the proposed solution in smart home, smart security, smart health care, and fire evacuation systems. Overall, the proposed solution can facilitate the integration of standard-based IoT resources and city models to support smart city applications. © 2014 IEEE.",City models; Internet of Things (IoT); ontology; open standard; smart city,Automation; Data integration; Integration; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Ontology; Smart city; Built environment; City model; Digital system; Domain model; Human-systems; Ontology's; Open Standards; Physical systems; Smart city.; Semantics,Article

In prefabricated construction, there are exacting requirements for information sharing. Also, data in a prefabricated component supply chain tend to be dispersed in design, production, transportation and other stages. In other words, such data are significantly multi-source heterogeneous. Without an effective way of participating in supply chain dynamic collaboration, decision-making at various stages and resource allocation can be extremely challenging. This paper proposes a decision support framework for prefabricated component supply chain based on ontology and multi-agent. The framework comprises the ontology layer (i.e. provides data support for the model), the agent interaction layer (i.e. serves as the communication hub to coordinate the data transmission between modules), and the agent simulation layer (i.e. simulates interaction behavior of participants, and supports decision making). Using the Shanghai Chenxiang Road Station complex project as a case study, the paper demonstrates the validity of the proposed ontology and multi-agent based decision support framework. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Multi-agent; Ontology; Prefabricated components; Simulation; Supply chain,Construction industry; Decision making; Multi agent systems; Ontology; Prefabricated construction; Supply chains; Communication hub; Decision support framework; Information sharing; Interaction behavior; Multi agent; Prefabricated components; Simulation; Supply chain dynamics; Decision support systems,Article

However, research shows that HVAC systems only ensure occupants’ satisfaction in the 11% of the commercial buildings. The advancing spread of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the maturity of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) may contribute to develop accurate predictive models which address this challenge. But data analysts in charge of developing these predictive models may feel overwhelmed if they have insufficient domain expertise. In this article, the ontology-driven approach proposed by the EEPSA (Energy Efficiency Prediction Semantic Assistant) is presented, in which data analysts can benefit from previously captured domain knowledge. Therefore, this article proposes the exploitation of Semantic Technologies to support data analysts in the discovery of the variables that should be considered for making accurate predictive models for thermal comfort problems within buildings. Compared with the existing tools or methods, the EEPSA is able to suggest variables that may not necessarily be included in the set of data available. This fact has a big potential nowadays, where the Linked Open Data and the third-party repositories can be exploited to incorporate relevant information. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Buildings; Data Analysis; Ontology; Thermal Comfort,Internet of things; Office buildings; Ontology; Open Data; Semantics; Thermal comfort; Built environment; Commercial building; Data analysts; Domain expertise; Efficiency predictions; HVAC system; Knowledge discoveries in database; Occupant satisfaction; Ontology's; Predictive models; Energy efficiency,Conference Paper

Several alignment variants are usually created and each one is intensely scrutinized. Variants often have individual advantages and disadvantages and can lead to different constructive designs of a tunnel. In order to find the best alignment possible the variants have to be analyzed and evaluated based on requirements and evaluation criteria, such as safety, cost, built environment and operational requirements. To perform this evaluation and to enable comprehensive decision making, a holistic planning environment is examined that includes documents and models of different domains. In general, these domain specific data differ schematically and semantically, which consequently makes it challenging to combine and compare such diverse data. For this purpose, information from different sources must be linked and evaluated in a structured way. In particular, spatial relationships have to be investigated. Therefore, in this paper, ontology databases are utilized to merge BIM and GIS at data level to create an integrated model of the entire tunneling project. Relevant information for decision-making can then be derived, such as the location of private and public buildings that are in a certain vicinity of the planned alignment. On the one hand, the implementation of queries is a popular and frequently used approach to check for semantic properties. On the other hand, using a query language to derive information from geometric data can be challenging, due to the necessity of processing geometric data prior to and during query execution. Additionally, geometric definitions can differ in the considered coordinate reference system, the dimension or the structure. To handle geometry information by employing query languages, representations are methodically transformed to well-known text literals. A simplified and uniform geometric representation can be utilized for spatial reasoning, for example by adopting GeoSPARQL methods. © 2022 The Author(s)",Alignment planning; BIM; GIS; Mechanized tunneling; Querying; Spatial reasoning,Architectural design; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Geographic information systems; Geometry; Query languages; Semantics; Tunnels; Alignment planning; BIM; Data querying; Decisions makings; Geometric data; Mechanized tunneling; Querying; Spatial reasoning; Tunnel alignments; Tunneling project; Decision making,Article

The innovations in digital technologies in Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) sector are not just related to the enhancement of consolidated processes, but they open new collaboration methods and integration with other Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as Internet of Things (IoT), additive manufacturing, automation, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. As domain-specific software solutions are expanding their features over different sources and datasets, the need for integration and standardization of information storage and exchange arises. Semantic Web technologies are one of the emerging solutions for solving such issues, as they offer the possibility to combine data from diverse data models and multiple domains using the web. Among the ontologies developed in the last decade for the construction sector, one specific reference should be made on the ifcOWL, an IFC-based ontology representing the most used data schema industry. Nonetheless, from the standardization point of view, so far ontologies have not been considered among the standard methods for information exchange in the AEC, unlike in other sectors (e.g. ISO 15926 was firstly developed for the integration of life cycle data for process plants of oil and gas facilities).

The ontologies developed and applied in the research project focus on geometry descriptions, the linking of geometric and non-geometric contents and the abstract description of building products.

The three objectives of this paper are to: define eco assets explicitly to reach a common understanding of the terms; evaluate the ontology; and discuss a potential area of application. Design/methodology/approach: A seven-step methodology was used to develop the proposed ontology: define the scope; develop the eco asset meta model (EA_MM), define taxonomy, code ontology, capture ontology, evaluate ontology and document ontology. Findings: The EA_MM was developed to represent eco asset domain knowledge, which was further extended to develop the EA_Onto, explicitly defining the eco asset knowledge in asset management. As a part of evaluation, it was found that the knowledge representation is consistent, concise, clear, complete and correct. Practical implications: Theoretically, the proposed ontology is a significant contribution to the body of knowledge in asset management. Practically, the knowledge representation provides a common understanding of eco assets for asset management experts. In addition, it will be used in applications for effective eco asset management. Originality/value: The current literature lacks explicit declaration of eco assets, how they are related to built environment for effective integration and how asset management functions are to be applied to accomplish effective eco asset management. Presently, eco assets are managed on an ad hoc basis, which need to be explicitly defined through developing an EA_Onto for implementation in applications for effective eco asset management. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Asset management; Eco asset; Eco asset knowledge management; Eco asset management; Eco asset ontology; Natural asset,,Article

This article presents an industrial Internet of things (IIoT) context-aware information system that provides decision support for mobile or static operators and supervisors. The system uniquely combines key IIoT concepts such as multi-layered, service-oriented architecture, which integrates several subsystems, such as sensor data acquisition together with concepts for developing context-aware systems such as context modelling and contextual data information provision. The proposed solution is relevant for several manufacturing environments. However, in dynamic, semi-structured manufacturing environments that the workstations are not fixed but dynamically change over time and in which the workers are mobile and not static to some predefined workstations, the utilisation of context-aware information delivery is considered as even more relevant. For that reason, a case study with a medium-sized shipyard has been selected and conducted. Industrial requirements were gathered and led to use cases for a customised implementation of the proposed solution into a shipyard. The proposed solution includes a number of context-aware apps that support the users in carrying out production tasks. The study provided insights into the suitability of the solution presented in the shipyard environment and brought to light further aspects that would improve the proposed context-aware system. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Cloud computing; cyber physical systems; Industry 4.0; information technology; ontologies; ship-building industry,Cloud computing; Construction industry; Cyber Physical System; Data acquisition; Decision support systems; Embedded systems; Floors; Industry 4.0; Information services; Information technology; Internet of things; Manufacture; Ontology; Ships; Shipyards; User interfaces; Building industry; Context modelling; Context-aware informations; Context-aware systems; Data informations; Industrial requirements; Intelligent service systems; Manufacturing environments; Service oriented architecture (SOA),Article

Today, with the development of the IFC project model by the IAI, the product modelling paradigm is being rapidly introduced in commercial software as well. However, actual PDT application in the AEC domain is still limited to CAD data exchange and some basic project-centred data management facilities. There is a great need of human-centred product model services supporting the engineer with additional knowledge about the models, providing customisable user-friendly capabilities for management and modification of the data, and enabling structured access to the information on the project(s) he is working on. These issues have motivated the development of an ontology framework that can serve as advanced user gateway to product model data. The suggested approach draws upon recent ICT achievements, especially regarding IFC environments.

Often, however, traditional data collection methods lack information on the spatial distribution of slum-dwellers. Remote sensing based methods could be used for a rapid inventory of the location and physical composition of slums. (Semi-)automatic detection of slums in image data is challenging, owing to the high variability in appearance and definitions across different contexts. This paper develops an ontological framework to conceptualize slums using input from 50 domain-experts covering 16 different countries. This generic slum ontology (GSO) comprises concepts identified at three levels that refer to the morphology of the built environment: the environs level, the settlement level and the object level. It serves as a comprehensive basis for image-based classification of slums, in particular, using object-oriented image analysis (OOA) techniques. This is demonstrated by with an example of local adaptation of GSO and OOA parameterization for a study area in Kisumu, Kenya. At the object level, building and road characteristics are major components of the ontology. At the settlement level, texture measures can be potentially used to represent the contrast between planned and unplanned settlements. At the environs level, factors which extend beyond the site itself are important indicators, e.g. hazards due to floods plains and marshy conditions.

As matter of fact, few methods exist that can help designers in such task, despite its importance in the definition of the building quality; norms and regulations, personal designer's experience, post-occupancy evaluation have shown their limit to provide predictive models of the complex phenomenon of human behaviour in built environments. With the increasing of computing power, virtual simulation techniques have been introduced in building design to control, manage and predict complex systems of building performances such as its energy or structural behaviour, but not to representation of buildings while-in-use. The Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) paradigm has been applied in building design to simulation of specific aspects of human behaviour and in specific occurrences (for instance in fire egress simulations), while a more extensive representation of users actions, behaviours, and activities is still missing. In order to overcome this lack, in this paper we propose to support agent-based simulation with a knowledge base, developed by means of ontologies and able to provide a structured system of data about human-building interaction, useful as start hypotheses for Agent-based Simulation. For its development, we rely on the general template of building knowledge management already proposed by the research group (Carrara et al., 2009), extending it to representation of the whole system users-built environment. The proposed general template, configured by the meaning - properties - rules structure, allows the formalization of users/agents entities, whose parameter, attributes and behavioural rules can encode several 'aspects' of real users and their interactions with the other entities (building components, furniture, other people) in a built environment. Currently, a first application has been developed dealing with the virtually testing of a small hospital ward, in order to evaluate the reliability and the potentiality of such approach.

Open standard SAWSDL is used to annotate web service descriptions with pointers to concepts defined in ontologies. NoSQL database Cassandra is used for distributed data storage among construction supply chain stakeholders. Findings - Ontology can be used to support heterogeneous data transfer and integration through web services. Distributed data storage facilitates data sharing and enhances data control. Practical implications - This paper presents examples of two ontologies for expressing construction supply chain information - ontology for material and ontology for purchase order. An example scenario is presented to demonstrate the proposed web service framework for material procurement process involving three parties, namely, project manager, contractor, and material supplier. Originality/value - The use of web services is not new to construction supply chains (CSCs). However, it still faces problems in channelizing information along CSCs due to data heterogeneity.

Part of this data concerns performance metrics expressed among others in terms of cost, energy consumption or system reliability. Such performance values are the focus of project stakeholders who try to optimize them already in building design phase. These values are computed by simulation software that reuses a subpart of the BIM data as input. This provides a better view of building performances but less on threats and underperformances in the building life cycle. Moreover, despite the existence of different risk analysis methods, these are still quite difficult to integrate into a BIM design process. This research aims at closing this gap by first, integrating risk information as well as related uncertainty sources into the BIM process. Second, a method is developed for simulating uncertainty and computing risk metrics.

The effective management of knowledge is vital to the survival and prosperity of a company, particularly in project-based industries such as construction. As a result, construction companies have adopted Information Technology (IT)-based KM systems (KMSs). KMS refers to the technology platform and infrastructure that an organization employs to support KM. However, the increasing attention given to KM is targeted at Large Multi-national Construction companies (LMCs), with little attention given to Small and Medium-sized Construction companies (SMCs). Compared to LMCs, SMCs need different sources and types of knowledge and technology to remain nourished and healthy. In this context, this research attempts to facilitate KM activities within SMCs through the distribution of a set of KM technologies tailored to meet the requirements of SMCs. First, we analyze key obstacles to implement KM activities within SMCs through a survey. Based on this analysis, a set of KM technologies are then identified and adapted to support the KM activities of SMCs in a feasible fashion. In addition, we discuss the expected change of organizational behavior by the distribution of those KM technologies. In the end, these technologies are synthesized into a web-based Construction Knowledge Management Portal (CKMP) system that seeks the inter-organizational sharing of construction knowledge.

Such a framework can also improve the successful accomplishment of building projects. This paper aims to use Semantic Web technologies for facilitating information exchange within existing building projects. Design/methodology/approach: In real-world building projects, the construction industry’s information supply chain may initiate from near scratch when new building projects are started resulting in diverse data structures represented in unstructured data sources, like Excel spreadsheets and documents. Large-scale data generated throughout a building's life-cycle requires exchanging and processing during an asset's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase. Building information modelling (BIM) processes and related technologies can address some of the challenges and limitations of information exchange and interoperability within new building projects. However, the use of BIM in existing and retrofit assets has been hampered by the challenges surrounding the limitations of existing technologies. Findings: The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it briefly outlines the framework previously developed for generating semantically enriched 3D retrofit models. Secondly, a framework is proposed focussing on facilitating the information exchange and interoperability for existing buildings. Semantic Web technologies and standards, such as Web Ontology Language and existing AEC domain ontologies are used to enhance and improve the proposed framework. Originality/value: The proposed framework is evaluated by implementing an example application and the Resource Description Framework data produced by the previously developed framework. The proposed approach makes a valuable contribution to the asset/facilities management (AM/FM) domain. It should be of interest to various FM practices for existing assets, such as the building information/knowledge management for design, construction and O&M stages of an asset’s life-cycle. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Building Information Modelling (BIM); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Information exchange and interoperability; Point Cloud Data (PCD); Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantic Web technologies; Web Ontology Language (OWL),Construction; Construction industry; Information dissemination; Interoperability; Life cycle; Ontology; Retrofitting; Semantic Web; Spreadsheets; Structural design; Supply chains; Building Information Modelling; Design/methodology/approach; Information exchange framework; Information supply chain; Operation and maintenance; Resource description framework; Semantic Web ontologies; Semantic Web technology; Architectural design,Article

It is designed to handle non-repetitive processes, where the course of actions has to be decided for each case individually, based on the assessment of the current situation. ACM uses domain-specific data and the analysis of rules to provide the relevant information at the right time to the business users. This supports their actions and decision making but does not dictate predefined workflows that are difficult or even impossible to define for knowledge-intensive work and prevent users from efficiently achieving their goals. Solutions for ACM implementations need to focus on business requirements to support business users rather than limit them by extending existing tools such as content management systems, BPM-based software suites, or collaboration tools with ad hoc development that all lack the ability to adapt flexibly to business level changes without requiring significant IT development efforts. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach by applying business architecture concepts for the definition of ACM applications in combination with domain-specific ontologies and business rules. Business domain analysts describe with the domain-specific ontology the complete value stream with its goals, activities and rules which use a formalized natural business language. The resulting business information model is mapped to an underlying data model and instantly enacted during case execution so that adaptations get immediately available to the business users. The behavioral business rules guide business users to guarantee case compliance which facilitates an easy and rapid adaptation of business applications. We apply this approach to a real life example from the construction industry where several parties from different trades have to collaborate in heterogeneous environments. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Adaptive Case Management; Behavioral Business Rules; Business Process Management; Data based execution; Ontology,Computer hardware description languages; Construction industry; Decision making; Ontology; Building construction projects; Business information modeling; Business process management; Business rules; Case management; Data based execution; Domain-specific ontologies; Heterogeneous environments; Human resource management,Conference Paper

However, building projects often suffer from deviations between planning and reality. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been extended to cover the whole building project life cycle, including the geometric modelling, collaboration mechanisms and building physics information. Although BIM enables the digitization of building planning and operation, the heterogeneity of supporting software, the different procedures of each company involved and the individuality of buildings themselves hinder a seamless collaboration between the parties, making it difficult to trace the impact of decisions. Adaptive Case Management (ACM) is a methodology to handle flexible business processes based on the achievement of business goals during case enactment, without defining strict process models. Therefore BIM management can take advantage of the ACM approach to support the accomplishment of business goals including the traceability between decision making and goal completion, such as compliance with energy-related KPIs. In this paper, we present the first results of applying business architecture principles to ACM for BIM project management that integrates domain-specific BIM tools for the content analysis.

Models that are incapable of assessing dimensional interactions and their collective outcomes are also incapable of providing critiques that address entrenched structural challenges to sustainability.

One impediment to the uptake of BIM is the limited interoperability of different BIM systems. To overcome this problem, a set of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) has been proposed as a standard for the construction industry. Building on IFC, the ifcOWL ontology was developed in order to facilitate representation of building data in a consistent fashion across the Web by using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). This study presents a critical analysis of the ifcOWL ontology and of the associated interoperability issues. It shows how these issues can be resolved by using Basic Formal Ontology (ISO/IEC 21838-2) as top-level architecture. A set of competency questions is used as the basis for comparison of the original ifcOWL with the enhanced ontology, and the latter is used to align with a second ontology - the ontology for building intelligent environments (DOGONT) - in order to demonstrate the added value derived from BFO by showing how querying the enhanced ifcOWL yields useful additional information. © 2021 - IOS Press.

The approach provides asset managers with a strategy for the dynamic use of Information Containers for Linked Document Delivery (ICDDs), considering the requirements of stakeholders across domains in the operational phase. The state of the art shows how information management can be carried out utilizing information containers employing Semantic Web technologies Resource Description Framework (RDF), SPARQL, and R2RML. The key output is developing a web-based platform that implements ICDD containers for asset management. Existing AMS are integrated by using SQL data mapped to RDF-based ontology data in the container. The use of existing domain-specific ontologies for infrastructure in combination with the linkage of domain knowledge to a three-dimensional BIM model is a step beyond the state of the art and practice in the construction industry. Linking inside the container allows for querying data across several information models and ontology-based data to create stakeholder-specific data views. The approach was demonstrated in two use cases. The first was related to the visual inspection of a concrete bridge. The detection of damage and the process of communicating the damage to a contractor charged with the repair were described. The second use case was related to a road pavement and demonstrated how decision-making about maintenance activities can be supported using cross-domain information containers. © 2022 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,.",,Architectural design; Asset management; Construction industry; Damage detection; Decision making; Information management; Information services; Information theory; Information use; Ontology; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Roads and streets; Asset management systems; Asset managers; Building Information Modelling; Document delivery; Infrastructure asset management; Operational phasis; Resources description frameworks; Semantic Web technology; Semantic-Web; State of the art; Containers,Article

But especially in the construction industry, products are often innovative and individually manufactured and previous attempts to depict them with ontologies failed to include meaningful alignments to already existing approaches. Thus, this paper gives an overview of existing product ontologies in general and analyses previous approaches in more detail to identify potential improvements that can be made. Based on this analysis, this paper presents the Building Product Ontology (BPO), including its concepts and alignments. To obtain a modular ontology, the BPO focuses on the non-geometric description without defining templates by determination of taxonomies and includes concepts to model assembly structures, interconnections of components, and complex properties and property values. The BPO enables manufacturers to freely model their products while still benefitting from the Semantic Web in respects of findability and availability of product data. By going through the given examples and demonstrations, inexperienced users are supported to apply the BPO and exploit its benefits. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

For these standards to be effective, they must be clearly defined and easily extensible, encourage consistency in their usage, and integrate cleanly with existing industrial standards, such as BACnet. There is a natural tension between informal tag-based systems that rely upon idiom and convention for meaning, and formal ontologies amenable to automated tooling. We present a qualitative analysis of Project Haystack [1], a popular tagging system for building metadata, and identify a family of inherent interpretability and consistency issues in the tagging model that stem from its lack of a formal definition. To address these issues, we present the design and implementation of the Brick+ ontology, a drop-in replacement for Brick [3] with clear formal semantics that enables the inference of a valid Brick model from an informal Haystack model, and demonstrate this inference across five Haystack models. © 2019 ACM.",Brick; Building Management; Haystack; Metadata; Ontologies; OWL; RDF; Smart Buildings,Brick; Formal methods; Intelligent buildings; Metadata; Ontology; Semantic Web; Semantics; Building management; Design and implementations; Formal definition; Haystack; Industrial standards; Qualitative analysis; Semantic metadata; Tag-based systems; Energy efficiency,Conference Paper

While technological advances have been made in these areas, such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema which would reduce the now-prohibitive cost of porting these applications and systems to different buildings. Recent attempts have sought to address this issue through data standards and metadata schemes, but fail to capture the set of relationships and entities required by real applications. Building upon these works, this paper describes Brick, a uniform schema for representing metadata in buildings. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and relationships among them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points, and running eight complex unmodified applications on these buildings.",Building management; Metadata; Ontology; Schema; Smart buildings,Brick; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Intelligent buildings; Metadata; Office buildings; Ontology; Building energy use; Building management; Commercial building; Cyber physical systems (CPSs); Human interactions; Portable applications; Schema; Technological advances; Buildings,Conference Paper

It contrasts this form of knowledge with the narratives of memorialization, and order and control, which I argue characterize post-war reconstruction. In this context the paintings are read as an ontological statement about the complexity and ambiguity of the urban landscape, one which contrasts with historical and contemporary narratives of the urban built environment.

While this method focuses on building data, the distribution of digital product models is still problematic, complicating uniform product searches and automated product data processing. Existing schemas, such as a subpart of the Industry Foundation Classes or the German VDI 3805, rely on rigid or template-driven schemas, that do not support the description of innovative or multi-functional products or impose a large schema overhead and complexity on manufacturers. Therefore, this article combines flexible and modular product descriptions with Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data. By applying Web-based technologies, the searchability of product data and the applicability of distributed data are expected to be enhanced. More precisely, this article proposes a concept for Linked Building Product Data and introduces the generic Building Product Ontology as a potential core schema of the concept. To demonstrate the feasibility of Linked Building Product Data and the Building Product Ontology, the authors apply both the concept and the data schema to innovative and multi-functional example products that cannot be described with the existing approaches for product descriptions. The evaluation demonstrates the flexibility, modularity and overall suitability of the presented concepts, meeting all collected requirements for digital product descriptions. Hence, Linked Building Product Data may solve existing issues with rigid product description schemas.

It suggests building material passports as a data source for the materials to be circulated and then integrates them by means of Linked Data.A common language is proposed to combine and re-use the material data in the CE with the creation of two ontologies: Circular Exchange Ontology (CEO) and the Circular Materials and Activities Ontology (CAMO). The ontologies annotate materials under a CE classification scheme and describe the elements required for material exchange to occur: actors, the activities they perform and the referents of these activities (resources, products, tools and waste).An evaluation of the ontologies is made by means of use case-driven SPARQL queries. Further, a wide-scale evaluation addresses how a decentralized data ecosystem can enable users to publish information and dynamically interact with different repositories to exchange materials. Results indicate that these ontologies can foster a circulation medium between diverse construction industry resources.

The potential also extends to the construction phase where the designers can provide more timely responses to problems encountered in the field. Within this environment, there is the need for effective mechanisms for design and construction information management, in addition to an ontology that facilitates the sharing of design and construction information and the underlying semantics.

The importance of classification is growing as building projects become more international, generating more data that rely on automated processes, which help in making better decisions and operating devices. Different classification systems have been developed around the world. Each national construction information classification system (NCICS) aims to classify information on the built environment and thus meet national needs and ensure compliance with the principles of regional and international building information systems. The research purpose of this paper is to present a comparative assessment of two construction information classification systems, CCI and Uniclass 2015. The following methods were used: the expert assessment of NCICS alternatives; the assessment of NCICS alternatives; and a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of NCICS alternatives. We concluded that in the initial phase of NCICS development, CCI ontologies should be adopted as a base consisting of construction entities, spaces, and elements, with the gradual addition of complexes of buildings and infrastructure, along with roles and phases of the building life cycle (BLC). An explanatory NCICS development note should be drawn outlining the principles of classification and identification; the ontological structure; development and updating possibilities; methods of integrating existing national and international classification systems; and methods of integrating data of construction products, time, cost, or other individual characteristics. © 2022 by the authors.

Ten construction project case-studies have been undertaken to assess levels of site management team working with the results evaluated against project performance. The case-study has two principle data collection methods. The team rating is assessed using an attitude questionnaire completed by all participating site team members.

Simultaneously, in contemporary architecture new frameworks emerged that have radically redefined the traditional conceptions of design, of the built environment, and of the role of architects. Cybernetic Architectures argues that such frameworks have been constructed in direct reference to cybernetic thinking, a thought model that emerged concurrently with the origins of informatics and that embodies the main assumptions, values, and ideals underlying the development of computer science. The book explains how the evolution of the computational perspective in architecture has been parallel to the construction of design issues in reference to the central ideas fostered by the cybernetic model. It unpacks and explains this crucial relationship, in the work of digital architects, between the use of information technology in design and the conception of architectural problems around an informational ontology.

First, the criteria of safety management is included in the developed system about fall accident based on「Rule on occupational safety and health standard」. Next, the construction information is extracted from BIM model and included in the developed system. Lastly, by using ontology, the rult of DfS is established, the possible of fall accident is noted to designer, and the design guide is provided automatically.

Accordingly, an innovative simulation approach based on High Level Architecture (HLA), which is currently used by other industries, is proposed in order to facilitate the building of large-scale models. HLA supports the building of complex simulation models using distributed simulation technology. In this way a large-scale model can be decomposed to facilitate collaboration between various components. The components are independently modeled and executed based on an underlying common object model, which allows for these independent simulation components to become integrated. This underlying structure is known within HLA terminology as the Federation Object Model (FOM). The rules, interactions, and interfaces which are established in FOM allow the components to combine into a coherent simulation. The greater the extent to which FOM is generalized and standardized, the better it facilitates interoperability and reusability of the simulation components. In this paper, in order to realize this goal, the FOM for large-scale industrial construction simulation modeling has been extracted as a subset of multi-perspective domain ontology.

Such systems support more effective collaboration, where virtual teams of skilled users, not software, exchange ideas, decisions, and best practice. To achieve that, there is a need to create consistent semantic representation of construction knowledge. Existing representations, in the form of classification systems and product data models, lack effective modeling of concept semantics - a fundamental requirement for human-based exchange of knowledge. Toward this objective, this paper presents a domain taxonomy that was developed as part of the e-COGNOS project. The taxonomy was developed as a first step in the establishment of domain ontology for construction. The taxonomy was developed to be process-centered and to allow for utilization of already existing classification systems (BS6100, Master Format, and UniClass, for example). The taxonomy uses seven major domains to classify construction concepts: Process, Product, Project, Actor, Resource, Technical Topics, and Systems. The taxonomy was developed and validated through extensive interaction with domain experts. The taxonomy was used to develop a prototype ontology for the construction domain including semantic relationships and axioms. The ontology was used to support several applications in semantic knowledge management as part of the e-COGNOS portal, including semantic indexing and retrieval of information and ontology-based collaborative project development. © ASCE.",Construction industry; Information management; Internet; Knowledge-based systems,Computer supported cooperative work; Construction industry; Decision making; Indexing (of information); Information management; Internet; Mathematical models; Semantics; Software prototyping; World Wide Web; Domain taxonomy; Ontology; Semantic indexing; Semantic web; Knowledge based systems,Review

After 1955, Empson emerged as a leading skeptic of literary “high” modernism by means of the novel analogy argued in his essay, “Donne the Space Man” (1957): namely, that literary depictions of space in Donne’s early poetry, athwart high Church doctrine, paralleled contemporary skepticism, in Empson’s own time, about interpretive orthodoxies within Eliotic criticism and among the American New Critics. With its focus upon what he calls “space travel,” Empson’s exegesis in “Donne the Space Man” (1957) pioneered what today one may call the scalar turn in literary modernist criticism. In Empson’s case, a scalar criticism endorsed Donne’s search for a more generous plurality of critical worlds and embraced cosmological scale irreducible to the more dogmatic worldview of Christian-inspired theorizations then prevailing. Re-reading the “Donne the Space Man” essay today–and when applying approaches inspired by the phenomenology of the contemporary built environment, object-oriented ontology, and unseen “lifeworlds”–allows for a more meaningful treatment of Empson’s criticism in its historical context, and when using scale as an heuristic to broaden our understandings of cosmologies, near and far, vastly different from our own. © 2017 The Author(s).

In this model, first,a set of extracts from the macro-credit feature space is designed and then, FPGA and neural network (FPGA, NN) models for credit evaluation is built based on these indicators, eventually it is applied scientifically, and reasonably, practically. Several state credit metrics are randomly selected. Our model shows applications that are both practical and competent. Using this model, authorities can analyze local credit conditions, allowing investors to make wise decisions to invest while saving on operating and credit costs. Most importantly, this model can help impulsive local government leaders, businesses, and even everyone to enhance competitiveness and capacities of attractive regions, thereby foster a good atmosphere for a credit culture. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Cost management; Field programmable gate array (FPGA); Financial ontology; Neural network,Competition; Computer hardware; Construction industry; Costs; Decision making; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Neural networks; Attractive Region; Commercial products; Construction companies; Construction projects; Credit evaluations; Information platform; Real-time dynamics; Software and hardwares; Cost benefit analysis,Article

These solutions typically include knowledge specifications in the form of different ontologies. Semantic heterogeneity can be resolved by applying ontology alignment methods to these ontologies. Therefore the development of the industrial strength software tools for solving different ontology alignment problems becomes important in the research and development. One of the practically important problems in the pool is the ontology instance migration problem. The paper presents the results of the evaluation of our solution of the ontology instance migration problem in industrial settings. The solution follows an iterative incremental approach involving a knowledge engineer as a process supervisor. Technically, the problem is solved by (i) automatically computing the structural difference between the schemas of ontologies; (ii) automatically generating the transformation rules for the individual assertions; (iii) automatically transforming the assertions; and (iv) manually controlling the completeness of those transformations and resolving problem cases. The solution has been evaluated by applying it to the ontologies in (i) libraries; and (ii) construction industry. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.",evaluation experiment; industrial application; Ontology alignment; ontology instance migration,Construction industry; Industrial applications; Research and development management; Semantics; Evaluation experiments; Instance migrations; Knowledge specification; Ontology alignment; Research and development; Semantic heterogeneity; Semantic technologies; Structural differences; Iterative methods,Conference Paper

Knowledge management has been hailed as an enabler for tapping this knowledge to improve efficiency in the AEC industry. In this study, the main concepts and benefits of knowledge management, relationships between knowledge management and continuous improvement have been examined. Furthermore, emphasis has been laid on knowledge management through experience feedback processes which constitute valuable assets for the AEC industry. This is done through the employment of ontologies and graph-based reasoning operations in eliciting and visualizing knowledge concepts in the AEC domain. The proposed approach which consists of two main aspects provides the opportunity to examine the conceptual and ontological knowledge models with associated reasoning. In the first, the concepts of knowledge management, their significance and application in the AEC field are discussed. The second deals with a methodological framework for the modeling and reasoning in the domain ontology. To facilitate automation, an ontology graph-based editor, Conceptual Graphs User Interface (CoGui) was used to model knowledge and encoded reasoning in the knowledge base. CoGui encodes knowledge as conceptual graphs and reasoning as graph operations that can be visualized in a logically precise way, based on domain ontologies. It emerged that CoGui could be very useful in acquiring information that can be used in collaboration with others to continuously improve information sharing and re-use.

In this study, the IFC is extended to describe the geometric information and hierarchy for an MCSRS, based on which an automatic workflow for converting the original design data to the corresponding 3D BIM model complying with IFC standard is developed. To validate the methodology, a real-world case is used for testing the modeling result, in which several different modeling cases between two cross-sections are examined.

There exist several cell classification ontologies with complementary information. However, one needs to merge them to synergistically combine their information. The main difficulty in merging is to match the ontologies since they use different naming conventions. Therefore, we developed an algorithm that merges ontologies by integrating the name matching between class label names with the structure mapping between the ontology elements based on graph convolution. Since the structure mapping is a time consuming process, we designed two methods to perform the graph convolution: vectorial structure matching and constraint-based structure matching. To perform the vectorial structure matching, we designed a general method to calculate the similarities between vectors of different lengths for different metrics. Additionally, we adapted the slower Blondel method to work for structure matching. We implemented our algorithms into FOntCell, a software module in Python for efficient automatic parallel-computed merging/fusion of ontologies in the same or similar knowledge domains. FOntCell can unify dispersed knowledge from one domain into a unique ontology in OWL format and iteratively reuse it to continuously adapt ontologies with new data endlessly produced by data-driven classification methods, such as of the Human Cell Atlas. To navigate easily across the merged ontologies, it generates HTML files with tabulated and graphic summaries, and interactive circular Directed Acyclic Graphs. We used FOntCell to merge the CELDA, LifeMap and LungMAP Human Anatomy cell ontologies into a comprehensive cell ontology. We compared FOntCell with tools used for the alignment of mouse and human anatomy ontologies task proposed by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) and found that the Fβ alignment accuracies of FOntCell are above the geometric mean of the other tools; more importantly, it outperforms significantly the best OAEI tools in cell ontology alignment in terms of Fβ alignment accuracies. © Copyright © 2021 Cabau-Laporta, Ascensión, Arrospide-Elgarresta, Gerovska and Araúzo-Bravo.",automatic ontology merging; cell ontology; Human Cell Atlas (HCA); ontology alignment; Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI); ontology merging,algorithm; animal cell; animal experiment; article; controlled study; directed acyclic graph; human; male; mouse; nonhuman; ontology; software,Article

In an attempt to do so, in 2011 the UK government made Building Information Modelling (BIM) level 2 a mandate for all public projects by 2016. Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is a project delivery approach closely attributed to BIM. However, it does not seem to have received proportionate level of attention and uptake in the UK. The research into reciprocal impacts of BIM and IPD are few and far between and non-existent in the UK construction context. This research investigates if and how IPD can facilitate BIM implementation in the UK. Capitalizing on relativist ontology, the study uses a mixed methodology to gauge industry experts' perception of the barriers to BIM implementation and uptake and the barriers to what constitutes IPD principles based on what has been found in the literature. The research findings support the hypothesis that IPD does help overcome barriers to collaboration, improve early involvement of the key participants and enhance the level of trust among key stakeholders; thereby helping eliminate the barriers to implementation of BIM. The research has also identified the main barriers to implementing IPD, which if overcome, could improve construction performance in terms of cost, time, efficiency and productivity in the UK by defragmenting parties through its multi-party agreement structure, facilitating BIM, enhancing parties’ early involvement and collaboration through its inherent BIM contractual principles. The findings suggest that IPD can facilitate better and wider uptake of BIM in the UK construction industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",BIM implementation; Building information modelling; Integrated project delivery; IPD facilitation; Project delivery methods,Construction industry; Information theory; Project management; BIM implementation; Building Information Modelling; Integrated project deliveries; IPD facilitation; Project delivery method; Architectural design,Article

Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The building and construction domain is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information between actors. For example, semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, are problems fundamentally created through the employment of representations to map the ‘world’ into models in an endeavour to anticipate different actors’ views, vocabulary, and objectives. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work is the process of formalization and representation of document content, where most existing approaches are limited in their capability and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched by incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (the Semantic Associations) modelled by domain ontologies combined with the information presented in documents, thereby providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework for representation of knowledge sources, where each knowledge source is semantically represented (within its domain of use) by a Semantic Vector. This work contributes to the enrichment of Semantic Vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support, employing ontology concepts and their relations in the enrichment process. The test bed for the assessment of the approach is the Building and Construction industry, using an appropriateB&CdomainOntology. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications.

Resequencing activities require planners to determine the impact or ""role"" an activity has on successor activities. They also need to determine the status of activities, i.e., which activities may or may not be delayed. Distinguishing the role and status of activities in turn requires planners to understand the rationale for activity sequences. The current critical path method (CPM) framework, however, represents sequencing rationale using precedence relationships and distinguishes activities only with respect to their time-criticality. Thus, planners find it difficult to keep track of individual sequencing logic, and manually inferring the role and status of activities becomes practically prohibitive in complex project schedules. The research presented in this paper addressed this limitation of the CPM framework by formalizing a constraint ontology and classification mechanism. The ontology allows planners to describe their rationale for activity sequences in a consistent and intuitive way, whereas the classification mechanism leverages the ontology to automatically infer the role and status of activities. The ontology and mechanisms were implemented in a prototype tool. With this tool, users can quickly verify which activities to delay to expedite critical milestone or bottleneck activities, thus making it possible to quickly evaluate and generate sequencing alternatives in CPM-based schedules. © 2007 ASCE.",Computer Aided Scheduling; Constraints; Construction management; Critical Path Methods,Complex project schedules; Construction managements; Critical Path Methods; Successor activities; Computer aided software engineering; Constraint theory; Critical path analysis; Engineering research; Formal logic; Ontology; Project management; Software prototyping; Construction industry,Article

To create complete as-built models, these methods require the visual sensors to have proper line-of-sight and field-of-view to building elements. For reporting progress deviations, they also require Building Information Modeling (BIM) and schedule Work-Breakdown-Structure (WBS) with high Level of Development (LoD). While certain logics behind sequences of construction activities can augment 4D BIM with lower LoDs to support making inferences about states of progress under limited visibility, their application in visual monitoring systems has not been explored. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes an ontology that models construction sequencing rationale such as physical relationships among components. It also presents a classification mechanism that integrates this ontology with BIM to infer states of progress for partially and fully occluded components. The ontology and classification mechanism are validated using a Charrette test and by presenting their application together with BIM and as-built data on real-world projects. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed ontology. It also illustrates how the classification mechanism augments 4D BIM at lower LoDs and WBS to enable visual progress assessment for partially and fully occluded BIM elements and provide detailed operational-level progress information. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, for example, are problems fundamentally originated through the employment of representations to map the 'world' into models in an endeavor to anticipate other actors' views, vocabulary, and even motivations. In this paper, the role of information technologies, actors, and representations is first presented within a framework of communication with the purpose of further illustrating the encountered problems in interrelating sources of information. Secondly, interoperability is examined within the context of interrelating sources of information. This explanation supports the claim that the description of concepts into some form of representation does not guarantee the understanding by other members of the community of what is described. Thirdly, an illustration of semantic reconciliation is presented through an engineering example. An approach to semantically reconcile representations is proposed through the study of the internal role of the representations. The research assumption is that if the internal role of a representation is recognized, the treatment of the conveyed semantics can be facilitated, revealing important aspects of the meanings to provide proper understanding during the transition from the source to the interpreter. Particularly, this investigation searches for the fundamental problems of semantically reconciling sources, and introduces theoretical notions from other disciplines to suggest alternative approaches for the encountered problems. Our contribution is to provide clarification of the challenge of reconciling information and to bring attention to the need for further research on the relationship of actors as social subjects and on the representation of information to the community. We anticipate the inclusion of this relationship in the research efforts will lead to a more effective sharing, exchanging, integrating, and communication of information among actors through the employment of IT. © 2011 The authors.",Communication; Conceptual models; Conceptual role semantics; Ontology; Semantics,Alternative approach; Conceptual model; Conceptual schemas; Construction projects; Fundamental problem; Integrating information; Research efforts; Semantic gap; Semantic reconciliation; Technical levels; Communication; Construction industry; Employment; Information technology; Ontology; Research; Semantics,Article

In the last decades, a wealth of georeferenced data is collected through sensors, mobile and web platforms from the crowd, providing rich information about people’s collective experiences and behaviors in cities. As a consequence, these new data sources require models able to make machine-understandable the social meanings and uses people commonly associate with certain places. This contribution proposes a set of reusable Ontology Design Patterns (ODP) to guide a data mining workflow and to semantically enrich the mined results. The ODPs explicitly aim at representing two facets of the geographic knowledge-the built environment and people social behavior in cities-as well as the way they interact. Modelling the interplay between the physical and the human aspects of the urban environment provides an ontology representation of the socio-spatial knowledge which can be used as baseline domain knowledge for analysing and interpreting georeferenced data collected through crowdsourcing.

This paper introduces a refined approach to extract SWRL rules from building accessibility regulatory texts and then to transform them into executable rules for semi-automatic compliance checking of Building Information Models. The domain ontology model is a key input to the approach and is enriched by new knowledge extracted from the regulatory text. This semantic technology enhanced rule extraction approach standardized the rule extraction process by covering the whole lifecycle from regulatory text to executable rules. It is based on the open standards and applies open source tools and thereby portable and extendable. It conforms to the open BIM principle to support knowledge sharing cross domains and disciplines. The approach is also adaptable to other types of regulatory rules in the building industry.,BIM; Ontology; OWL; Regulatory compliance check; Rule extraction; Semantic annotation; SWRL,Architectural design; Building codes; Buildings; Compliance control; Computer programming languages; Construction industry; Extraction; Ontology; Semantics; Standards; Transportation; Building Information Model - BIM; Compliance checking; International standards; Rule extraction; Rule extraction process; Semantic annotations; Semantic technologies; SWRL; Regulatory compliance,Conference Paper

Comprising a centralized database of all relevant information for the entire bridge stock and analytics to forecast bridges' condition and maintenance cost, BMSs are irreplaceable tools, used by all the National Road Authorities (NRAs) around the world. These powerful tools, although different from one another, all lack adequate visualization of bridges. Recently, numerous researcher proposed using the Building Information Models (BIMs) to address this issue. This paper presents the geometric approach of introducing BIM to BMS. Rather than trying to thoroughly connect these two robust systems on the object definition level, this approach focuses on geometry. The paper firstly shows how all the inventory information from BMS can be associated with corresponding BIM objects. Afterward, the ways to include the condition assessment data into BIM are proposed. Once the basics of the geometric approach are explained, the example of connecting BIM with BMS is presented. The example is based on KUBA, the Swiss BMS. Finally, the feasibility, as well as the challenges of the presented approach are analyzed. The analysis focused on two important questions. Firstly, it considered if BIM is capable of making workflow changes in the Infrastructure Asset Management (IAM) the same way it did it in the construction industry. Secondly, it evaluated the BIM capability to describe all the condition assessment information relevant to IAM. © 2022 IABSE Symposium Prague, 2022: Challenges for Existing and Oncoming Structures - Report.

This is partly due to policies by various governments requiring existing and new buildings to comply with certain standards or regulations. However, the verification of whether a building complies with any particular standard or regulation has proven challenging in practice. The purpose of formal verification is to prove that under a certain set of assumptions, a building will adhere to a certain set of requirements, for example the minimum performance standards of key environmental issues. Compliance checking requires different criteria often difficult to straightforwardly define and combine in an integrated fashion for providing holistic interpretation to facilitate easy decision-making. Such criteria, their various flows and combinations can easily be dealt with using conceptual graph theories and Semantic Web concepts which allow rules to be imbued to facilitate reasoning. The aim of this study is to tap on conceptual graphs and Semantic Web concepts to develop a system for checking Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM) sustainability standard compliance in the French construction industry. A conceptual graph-based framework that formally describes BREEAM requirements and visually analyse compliance checking processes has been proposed. When implemented in a software that integrates conceptual graphs and Semantic Web knowledge, automatic reasoning allows both the logical specification and the visual interpretation to be displayed and further provides a semantic support for compliance checking information. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Building; Data; Information; Knowledge; Reasoning; Sustainability,Buildings; Construction industry; Decision making; Flow graphs; Formal verification; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Regulatory compliance; Semantic Web; Sustainable development; Building research establishment environmental assessments; Construction projects; Data; Information; Knowledge; Logical specifications; Performance standards; Reasoning; Compliance control; article; building industry; decision making; ontology; semantic web; software,Article

The simulation of construction operations has been a growing field of research over the last several decades. Since the introduction of the first simulation system, which was based on the activity cycle diagram paradigm of modeling, numerous additional tools have been introduced, each building on and expanding the modeling and analytical capabilities of previous approaches. However, despite such rich body of knowledge, which by now is expanding into areas such as visualization, animation, and virtual reality applications for construction project management, the beneficial application of simulation in practice has been marginal. This paper describes both historical and practical reasons for this situation and presents an ontology-based approach that can harness existing information in construction project management, especially the scheduling function, and has the potential to significantly improve its operational planning and optimization. © 2008 IEEE.",,Activity cycle diagrams; Body of knowledge; Construction operations; Construction project managements; Construction simulations; Decision supports; Graphical representations; Ontology-based; Operational planning; Scheduling functions; Simulation systems; Animation; Construction industry; Decision support systems; Ontology; Scheduling; Virtual reality; Planning,Conference Paper

However, little is known about the process by which this occurs and how effectively this happens. These questions are addressed by an exploration of how individual hospital stakeholders learn about the performance of their facilities and share these lessons in the adaptation of future hospital disaster management plans. More specifically, the evidence of behavioural and social/collective learning is investigated amongst hospital stakeholders during EWEs. The data gathered from a case study of a major hospital network of four hospitals were qualitatively analysed within a constructionist ontology and interpretivist epistemology using causal loop diagrams (CLDs). This revealed how lessons were learned in the hospital network from collective stakeholder EWEs’ experiences. The findings highlight the need to develop appropriate processes and structures to capture, share and use facilities-related knowledge and embed new lessons learnt into future hospital disaster planning processes.

In their results, they provide documents as query answers without considering (i) detailed information regarding relevant granularity levels of the documents, and most importantly (ii) dependencies between the documents or parts of the documents. To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-based search and ranking algorithm within a generic framework that retrieves the data in the form of a novel augmented data structure for query answers, which we call hybrid molecules. The latter consist of well-defined subgraphs representing relevant contextual information regarding domain-specific information coupled with structural information related to the document.

The IFCs are intended to enable effective information sharing within the AEC/FM industry, but are still mainly at a prototype stage of development. The standards have similar objectives but show fundamental differences in semantics and structure. This work compares the standards and points out similarities and differences, firstly in order to understand their structure, and secondly to initiate a discussion about the need and the possibility to coordinate them. An integration of IFC with ISO 12006-2 would facilitate and speed up the application in everyday practise of object-based information management. According to the documentation, the starting point of IFC was to reject classification, and therefore integration with ISO 12006-2 would require a major shift of approach. Development of a common meta model, a generic domain model, and a coordinated domain framework are considered necessary tasks.",Construction classification; IFC; Interoperability; ISO 12006-2; Onstruction ontology,,Review

Many studies have been completed on the application of the lean philosophy to meet the challenges of sustainable development in precast concrete factories. Many non-value adding activities have been identified in both site layout and supply chain for precast concrete manufacturers. However, the production process should not be overlooked from a lifecycle perspective. This study adopts a weighted factor model comprising of 17 precasters in the Singapore precast concrete industry. The production process is investigated using the weighted factor model. The results indicate that there are many non-value adding activities in the production practices that contribute to an increase in the carbon emissions level. Large inventory level, wastage of raw materials and inexperienced employees seem to be the most important non-value adding activities. The analysis provides good practice guidance and can be used as a checklist for precasters to identify the non-value adding activities in the precast concrete production process to achieve low-carbon production. The results will also be useful for regulatory agencies to provide recommendations for precast concrete manufacturers to reduce carbon emissions. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.",climate change; lean; prefabrication; sustainable development,Climate change; Construction industry; Manufacture; Ontology; Planning; Production engineering; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Concrete production process; Concrete productions; lean; prefabrication; Production practice; Production process; Regulatory agencies; Toyota Production System; Precast concrete,Article

Among these efforts, the Toyota way model is viewed as an appropriate approach that pinpoints various aspects of lean, covering long-term philosophy, process, people and partners, and problem solving. Adopting the Toyota way model, this paper investigates the impact of the implementation of Toyota way on the quality and productivity performance of large construction firms in China. Based on the fieldwork involving a questionnaire survey conducted in China, stepwise regression was used to determine which of the Toyota way-style practices lead to predictors of project quality and productivity. This paper provides insights for improving the implementation of the Toyota way in the construction industry. The results show that different practices may affect specific performance measures. Chinese construction firms should therefore prioritize resources and efforts to implement the critical principles identified to enhance performance. For example, if construction firms in China wish to focus on project quality achievement, the critical factors are as follows: be responsible for products, employees, and society (from the philosophy model); the project manager plans the work with input from other parties; reject defective materials, components, and equipment; the workplace follows 5S principles (from the process model); work with partners to improve project effectiveness; take part in partners' production process (from the people and partner model); and conduct kaizen activities (from the problem-solving model). © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",China's construction industry; Large firms; Productivity; Quality; Stepwise regression; Toyota way principles,Human resource management; Image quality; Ontology; Productivity; Construction firms; Large firms; Performance measure; Production process; Productivity performance; Questionnaire surveys; Stepwise regression; Toyota way principles; Construction industry,Article

However, it is difficult to find those regulations and codes most relevant to a particular decision, even though they are now in digital form, and often available online. The focus of this work is to map regulations and codes to existing industry-specific taxonomies that would improve their access and retrieval and facilitate their integration with application programs. Keyword matching is a commonly used technique for mapping from a single taxonomy to a single regulation. In this paper, we examine techniques to address two other mapping problems: from a single taxonomy to multiple regulations and from multiple taxonomies to a single regulation. Those techniques - Cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient, and market basket analysis - provide metrics for measuring the similarity between concepts from different taxonomies. We discuss these metrics and provide evaluations using examples from the building industry.

Processes are defined within corporate operating standards by the most sophisticated firms, but research studies confirm that they are not implemented consistently from project to project. It is well established from statistical analysis of hundreds of projects that improved process conformance and improved interoperability are correlated with substantial improvements in project performance in terms of cost, schedule, and productivity. Process conformance in many industry sectors such as health care, manufacturing, and banking has been radically improved with automation and integration of processes via workflow engines. In the construction industry, data interoperability has substantially been improved over the years with employment of data modeling techniques and standards. Process interoperability which enables inter-organizational communication between project stakeholders in large-scale construction projects is relatively less developed. This paper introduces the concept of Industry Foundation Processes (IFP), and discusses its development and applications. IFP is a unique process modeling system that facilitates integration of core processes of known best practices in the construction industry into workflow management systems, and improves process conformance and interoperability. IFP processes are defined as structured workflow processes based on known best practices in the construction industry, with specific features and properties that comprise the IFP ontology: version, scope, core structure, abstraction level, data structures, recommended practices, workflow inheritance, conformance, and interoperability. In addition, this paper offers an implementation framework for the IFP system, and describes how IFP processes can be customized to more detailed processes suitable to particular types of projects, and then to specific projects, and how the IFP ontology facilitates improved process conformance and interoperability in the domain of the construction industry. © CSCE-CRC International Construction Specialty Conference 2017 - Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference and General Meeting 2017.All rights reserved.",,Construction industry; Interoperability; Ontology; Work simplification; Construction project management; Construction projects; Data interoperability; Development and applications; Inter-organizational; Process interoperability; Recommended practice; Workflow management systems; Project management,Conference Paper

The study takes a critical view on the claimed advantages of non-conventional, innovative project procurement strategies as integration-enhancing mechanisms at the project level. Taking a swimming pool construction project governed by an innovative procurement procedure known as 'two-stage tender' as a case in point, the paper evaluates the extent to which better project team integration has been achieved in this context. Two major concerns emerged from the case study analysis: (1) two-stage tendering is an incomplete solution to tensions, adversarial culture and a lack of genuine cooperation over time; and (2) there is a need for facilitating mechanisms of a different nature to support and sustain collective situated learning and shared understanding of longer-term benefits of collaborative work. Based on the theoretical considerations and the interpretation of the empirical accounts, the paper proposes and refines a conceptual framework for understanding the complexity of construction projects as social settings. In the light of this framework, alternative concepts and skills for enhanced collaborative interaction among participating parties in this kind of social setting are suggested. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.",Collaboration; Complexity; Construction project; Interaction; Management skills; Organizational change; Project dynamics; Project management; Team integration; Two-stage tender,Computational complexity; Computer supported cooperative work; Construction industry; Collaboration; Complexity; Construction project; Interaction; Management skills; Organizational change; Project dynamics; Team integration; Two-stage tender; Project management,Review

Architecture, engineering, and construction industry spends time and money to solve the information sharing and interoperability issues between different domains. With the advent of building information modeling, a 3D CAD model of a project is used as a shared knowledge resource during the design, construction, and facility management phases of a project's life cycle. Currently, 4D models are created by combining CAD and schedule information. A 4D model is useful for detecting potential construction conflicts during the project planning and design and a valuable tool during construction. However, creating 4D models requires a great amount of human involvement. An approach that facilitates integrating BIM and schedule information can improve efficiency and is highly desirable. This paper presents a new approach to information modeling using the Semantic Web technology. The Semantic Web provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that allows computers to access and combine information distributed over the Internet. The paper discusses: (1) ontologies that the authors have developed for BIM and project schedule information; (2) how ontologies are used for creating project knowledge bases in RDF/OWL format; and (3) how project knowledge bases can facilitate machine processing of project information and semantic interoperability among project knowledge bases. The Semantic Web approach allows information to be saved once at the provider source and be used by authorized users as needed. This means BIM information is created and maintained by designers and project schedule is created and maintained by schedulers on their respective servers. This would allow the latest BIM and project schedule information to be accessed over the Internet and combined for various purposes. © ASCE.",,"Architectural design; Budget control; Computer aided design; Construction industry; Information analysis; Information management; Information theory; Information use; Internet; Interoperability; Life cycle; Office buildings; Semantic Web; Architecture , engineering , and constructions; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction projects; Information Modeling; Project informations; Semantic interoperability; Semantic web approach; Semantic Web technology; Project management",Conference Paper

The convergence of building information modeling with the smart water field provides an opportunity to transcend existing operational barriers. Such research would pave the way for demand-side management, active consumers, and demand-optimized networks, through interoperability and a system of systems approach. This paper presents a semantic knowledge management service and domain ontology which support a novel cloud-edge solution, by unifying domestic socio-technical water systems with clean and waste networks at an urban scale, to deliver value-added services for consumers and network operators. The web service integrates state of the art sensing, data analytics and middleware components. We propose an ontology for the domain which describes smart homes, smart metering, telemetry, and geographic information systems, alongside social concepts. This integrates previously isolated systems as well as supply and demand-side interventions, to improve system performance. A use case of demand-optimized management is introduced, and smart home application interoperability is demonstrated, before the performance of the semantic web service is presented and compared to alternatives.

This study identifies similarities between the industry foundation classes and ontology likewise their differences with the hope that it would develop an enhanced knowledge conceptualization of the domain.

Purpose: The objective of this study is to provide a methodology to integrate the social and physical environments in the development of a mobility ontology for people with motor disabilities (PWMD). Methods: We propose to create subclasses of concepts based on a Nature-Development distinction rather than creating separate social and physical subclasses. This allows the relationships between social and physical elements to be modelled in a more compact and efficient way by specifying them locally within each entity, and better accommodates the complexities of the human-environment interaction as well. Based on this approach, an ontology for mobility of PWMD considering four main elements–the social and physical environmental factors, human factors, life habits related to mobility and possible goals of mobility–is presented. Conclusions: We demonstrate that employing the Nature-Development perspective facilitates the process of developing useful ontologies, especially for defining the relationships between the social and physical parts of the environment. This is a fundamental issue for modelling the interaction between humans and their social and physical environments for a broad range of applications, including the development of geospatial assistive technologies for navigation of PWMD.Implications for rehabilitation The proposed perspective may actually have much broader interests beyond the issue of disability–much of the interesting dynamics in city development arises from the interaction between human-developed components–the built environment and its associated entities–and natural or organic components. The proposed approach facilitates the process of developing useful ontologies, especially for defining the relationships between the social and physical parts of the environment. This is a fundamental issue for modeling the interaction between human -specially people with disabilities -and his social and physical environments in a broad range of domains and applications, such as Geographic Information Systems and the development of geospatial assistive technologies for navigation of people with disabilities, respectively. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",disability; GIS; mobility; Ontology; physical environment; social environment,construction work and architectural phenomena; disabled person; environment; human; rehabilitation; self help device; social environment; social participation; Architectural Accessibility; Disabled Persons; Environment; Humans; Self-Help Devices; Social Environment; Social Participation,Article

However, without considering the human dimension, technologies alone do not necessarily guarantee high performance in buildings. Occupant behavior is a leading factor influencing energy use in buildings. To investigate and quantify the human dimension in a building's energy use, an international research study has been launched as part of project ANNEX66, organized by the International Energy Agency using an interdisciplinary framework. The framework is a synthesis of theories from building physics and social psychology including social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the drivers-needs-actions-systems ontology for energy-related behaviors. As a research tool, an online survey was designed to collect cross-country responses from office occupants among 14 universities within 6 countries from 4 continents.

For upcoming, new approaches to store building data, such as the Semantic Web, no universal common agreement exists on the combination of geometric and non-geometric data. It can therefore be unclear to users on how to represent their geometries, leading to a decelerated application and advancement of making building data available over the web. This gap can only be bridged if a common approach on the representation of geometries on the web is achieved. To first generate a common understanding of geometry representations, an overview of existing and developing geometry (web) standards needs to be given and discussed, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), CityGML, GeoSPARQL, and the OntoBREP and GEOM ontologies. This discussion needs to consider general contexts, e.g., 2D, 3D, detailed, or tessellated geometries, and specific use cases of the construction industry. Based on these discussions, this paper aims to propose a general recommendation for web-based geometry representations to enhance future applications of building data on the web. Due to the variety of use cases and their requirements, as well as technical constraints based on deviant interpretations of geometry descriptions from different geometry kernels, it became clear, that no approach or standard is generally superior to others. The biggest distinction identified in this paper is posed between the context of visualizing, where simplified, tessellated geometry holds the highest advantage, and (parametric) modeling, which requires semantically detailed geometry representations. Hence, we recommend to interlink non-geometric data with multiple geometry representations, to address all relevant contexts and use cases appropriately. The individual geometry representations should be chosen based on the relevant use cases for an optimal experience when using and exchanging geometry on the web. With this recommendation, the benefits of all discussed approaches can be exploited while avoiding their respective challenges. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Building information modeling; Geometry; Geospatial data; Industry foundation classes; Linked Data; Ontology; Web technologies,Architectural design; Construction industry; Linked data; Ontology; Building Information Model - BIM; Design and construction; Future applications; Geo-spatial data; Geometry representation; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Technical constraints; Web technologies; Geometry,Article

To identify the relationship between intelligent railways, digital engineering and railway BIM, and to provide technical support for the top-level technical route of the intelligent railway scientifically and reasonably, the railway industry necessitates the spatial view of digital engineering and the organizational principle of system control theory. Research conclusions:(1) Constructing digital railway project is the premise and carrier of intelligent railway engineering. (2) This paper points out three insurmountable problems of railway BIM to construct digital railway engineering from the perspective of space ontology and engineering cybernetics, namely, space unity, efficient construction and systematic organization. (3) The status of BIM in the railway industry far exceeds its position in the digital engineering system. Applying BIM blindly in the construction industry to railway engineering, will make the development of railway digital engineering constrained. (4) The three-dimensional digital railway products based on spatial ontology and system cybernetics, follow the technical philosophy of digital earth→digital city→digital engineering. From the perspective of 3D GIS technology and space view, universal adaptive value of the full life cycle is provided in the form of spatial database organization with the development of automatic modeling of railway engineering components, which can create physical conditions and application means for the development of intelligent railway applications. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Railway Engineering Society.

In this context, there has been a need for a proper means of exchanging and managing of different kinds of data (e.g., geospatial data, sensor data, 2D/3D models data, material data, schedules, regulatory, financial data) by different kinds of stakeholders and end users, i.e., planners, architects, engineers, property owners and managers. DSSs are used to support various processes inherent in the various building life cycle phases including planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance, retrofitting and demolishing. Such tools are in some cases based on established technologies such Building Information Models, Big Data analysis and other more advanced approaches, including Internet of Things applications and semantic web technologies. In this framework, semantic web technologies form the basis of a new technological paradigm, known as the knowledge graphs (KG), which is a powerful technique concerning the structured semantic representation of the elements of a building and their relationships, offering significant benefits for data exploitation in creating new knowledge. In this paper, a review of the main ontologies and applications that support the development of DSSs and decision making in the different phases of a building’s life cycle is conducted.

Construction contract administration is a complex, knowledge-intensive process that if properly managed can mitigate the contractor's risk exposure. Challenges in proper knowledge management of contract administration are due to: 1) Large amount of fragmented information that is required to manage a construction contract, 2) Information located in heterogeneous sources (Request For Information (RFIs), site notices, schedules, contracts, etc...), 3) Information is handled by many actors in the organization (planners, schedulers, site supervisors, etc...), and 4) Concentration of knowledge related to construction contract administration within a select few in the organization. Knowledge management can play a vital role in the formalizing, sharing and reuse of knowledge related to the contract administration process. This paper presents domain ontology for the construction contract administration process. The ontology formalizes knowledge in contract administration in the form of five main concepts (processes, events, actors, products and constraints).

The use of semantic technologies is an alternative to integrate data and make inferences in the decision-making process. This work presents the elaboration of an ontology to integrate data and support the evaluation of a construction regarding the fulfillment of the LEED certification requirements (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design). Data from a project developed on a BIM (Building Information Modeling) platform are integrated with other tabulated open data. These datasets are semantically annotated following the semantic data dictionary approach to RDF conversion. Once the datasets are integrated into a triplestore, queries are performed to explore the linking of this data with the generation of inferences. The results suggest that the application of these technologies promotes the semantic extension of construction elements in BIM, facilitating their integration with other knowledge bases and conceptually organizes the data to better retrieve information. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",,Data integration; Decision making; Linked data; Open Data; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantics; Sustainable development; Assessment tasks; Building Information Modelling; Built environment; Certification requirements; Construction projects; Decision-making process; Knowledge model; Ontology's; Semantic technologies; Sustainability performance; Architectural design,Conference Paper

There has been burgeoning research on the technical aspects of ZCBs. However, the aspect of stakeholder engagement, albeit imperative for zero carbon development, has been largely overlooked in the literature. This paper examines stakeholder knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) with regard to ZCBs in a systems manner, employing a new KAP model that integrates ontology, axiology and epistemology as the theoretical lens. The research was carried out through a questionnaire survey and focus group discussions with multiple stakeholders in the building industry in Hong Kong, which is a typical example of a high-density city. The results indicate the generally ambiguous and inconsistent knowledge, relatively negative attitude, and poor practice of stakeholders towards ZCBs. The statistical analysis findings reveal that differentiation exists between different stakeholder groups as to their knowledge, and this highlights the significant role that explicit ZCB knowledge plays in creating a knowledge-induced attitude that favours changes in practice leading to zero carbon developments. The applicability of the developed KAP model is verified using the case of Hong Kong, enabling the dialectics and complexities of stakeholder KAP towards ZCBs to be further clarified. Practical implications are provided to enhance the knowledge, shape the attitudes, and encourage the practices of building towards zero carbon in future cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon emission; Energy efficiency; Hong Kong; Stakeholder; Sustainable practice; Zero carbon building,Climate change; Construction industry; Emission control; Surveys; Building industry; High-density cities; Innovative strategies; Low-carbon societies; Multiple stakeholders; Questionnaire surveys; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder groups; Carbon,Article

Geospatial data often must be integrated for meaningful analysis, whereas such integration is challenging due to siloed data organization, semantic heterogeneity and multiple representation of geospatial data. Moreover, the visualization of geospatial data is one of the most prominent ways of utilizing geospatial data, however how to properly visualize the data is sometime difficult, as it pertains to a wide range of visualization (cartographic) knowledge. Semantic Web technologies unveil a promising way to mitigate these issues, as they provide means of data integration on the Web, and knowledge representation capacity to formally represent the visualization knowledge. In this PhD project, we investigate the potential values of Semantic Web technologies for geospatial data integration (particularly for geospatial data with multiple representation) and visualization in several cases, where the integration and visualization knowledge is formalized using Semantic Web technologies. All the case studies embody realworld meaning and entail data integration and visualization challenge, which have been addressed by state-of-the-art solutions inadequately.

The company has reaped many benefits from the Lean philosophy at its construction sites but it realized that the office was left behind in the process and needed to catch up to sustain the gains reached by site operations. In order to engage the office personnel in a Lean Office initiative, the first step was to disseminate the Lean philosophy in a seminar and brainstorm possible actions to be taken at the office.

To execute the T5 project, BAA selected an innovative approach by implementing a true partnering philosophy. Design firms and major system suppliers were pre-selected based on qualification submittals. The true uniqueness of the T5 project was in not utilizing a typical and traditional contract as would normally be used in the construction industry. It was a very different arrangement for all parties.

In 1999, after nearly 500 years of colonial administration, Portugal returned Macau to the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Macau was designated a Special Administrative Region under the PRC's “one country, two systems” framework. Following the handover, the Macau government liberalized the local casino monopoly and awarded casino gaming concessions to several companies from Macau, Hong Kong, North America, and Australia. Over the past decade, these companies have invested tens of billions of dollars to construct a phantasmagoric post-colonial cityscape comprised of themed integrated casino resorts such as Venetian, Parisian, Galaxy, Wynn Palace, and City of Dreams. As a result, Macau has become the world's most lucrative site of casino gaming, with annual gaming revenues quintuple those of Las Vegas. The city is visited annually by 30 million tourists, more than half of whom are from mainland China. This travel is facilitated by a special exit visa, which the PRC grants to citizens from select, relatively affluent cities and provinces. The PRC promotes such tourism in service of the country's macroeconomic planning, which aims to rapidly urbanize 150 million rural peasants in an effort to create a domestic consumer economy, in order to wean the country off its reliance on an unsustainable production-for-export regime. In this chapter I adopt a materialist ontology to explore the articulation of the new casino resorts with Macau's traditional Portuguese calcada pavement tiles, which the outgoing Portuguese administration installed in a project in the 1990s to pedestrianize Macau's historic city center. Macau's built environment serves a pedagogical function for Chinese tourists by producing cosmopolitan “quality” consumer subjects, and both the calcada tiles and the interiorized and enclosed urban environment created by Macau's resorts produce a Chinese urban imaginary that is a crucial component of this process. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Christoph Lindner and Miriam Meissner.",,,Book Chapter

Industry practitioners, unlike legal practitioners, are familiar with one or more industry-specific taxonomies but not necessarily regulatory organization systems.

A mapping from a single taxonomy to a single regulation is a trivial keyword matching task. From there, we examine techniques to map a single taxonomy to multiple regulations, as well as to map multiple taxonomies to a single regulation. Cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient and market-basket analysis are tested to model the similarity metric between concepts from different taxonomies. Preliminary evaluations of the three metrics are performed. Examples from the building industry are drawn to illustrate the betterment of regulatory usage from the mapping between various taxonomies and regulations.

This new research method is related to other methods currently used to study contemporary as well as historical urban built environments such as urban morphology, space syntax, and GIS based approaches. BLT mapping uses GIS technology in order to apply an ontology of formal boundary conceptualisations expressing the constitutive differences among the materially constructed subdivisions which shape built environments and are inhabited by urban society. This ontology resulted from a firm socio-spatial theoretical grounding (Vis in Sp Flows: Int J Urb ExtraUrb Stud 2(4): 15–29, 2013a; Vis 2013b; Vis in J Borderland Stud, forthcoming) and is here operationalised on the basis of contemporary, historical, historically reconstructed, and archaeological ground-level city plans of the historic city of Winchester (UK) and Chunchucmil (Classic Maya, Mexico). The research processes of data preparation and the analytical mapping of BLTs by identifying them in empirical data contexts are presented. This alerts the prospective user to the challenges and practical measures involved in using spatial datasets of different origin. The interpretive opportunities of the resultant formal redescription of the urban landscape and the potential of the BLT data structure for both advanced spatial analysis and visualisation is explained. Facilitating this interpretive and analytical mapping practice is expected to stimulate future research to systematically explore society-space relations as manifest and developing in cities over time and in socio-culturally contrasting urban traditions. Devising and conducting this methodology advances the qualitative GIS research agenda for the spatial humanities and social sciences by marrying theoretically informed ideational concepts to quantifiable empirical units of information. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,Geographic information systems; Ontology; Studs (structural members); Urban planning; Mapping; Studs (fasteners); Syntactics; Analytical mapping; Built environment; Comparative methods; Different origins; Humanities and social science; Practical measures; research methods; Spatial relations; Boundary lines; Ontology's; Research method; Type mappings; Urban form; Urban morphology; Mapping; Geographic information systems,Conference Paper

Design/methodology/approach: This research generates contextual and holistic understandings of multiple project-level cases of BIM adoption through an interpretive paradigm guided by relativist ontology and subjectivist epistemology. Two models of project-level BIM adoption (ten-factor theory of BIM adoption and strategic-contingent model of BIM adoption) were merged to formulate the BIM adoption assessment scale (BIM-AAS). A qualitative-oriented case study protocol was developed to extract valid and reliable data from external and internal project data based on BIM-AAS features. The extracted data were analysed using the pattern-matching technique and cross-case analysis. Findings: The results indicate that there was substantial use of BIM tools and technologies in the projects. All the projects adopted collaborative procurement and team and developed integrated building information models. The use of BIM tools, technologies and processes in the projects was found to be above average. The complexities and expectations levels of the projects compliment the nature of BIM adoption in the projects. Research limitations/implications: The BIM-AAS adopted in this research is an excellent example of a project-level BIM adoption analytical tool. It can be assumed in future research. Also, this research contributes to the theory that the level of project complexity and expectations must align with the level of BIM adoption in projects. The study’s findings ratify BIM tools, technologies and processes as the elements of project-level BIM adoption. Practical implications: This research substantiates the actual nature and structure of BIM adoption in Nigeria, thereby simplifying the development of initiatives towards BIM adoption in projects and determining the appropriate strategies for BIM implementation and innovation in the Nigerian construction industry. The most important initiative that the Nigerian government can make to drive BIM implementation is the automating of code checking for building rules and regulations in Nigeria. Originality/value: Previous studies have only reported cases of project-level BIM adoption using surveys and without a standardised project-level BIM adoption model to guide the analysis. This study is the first to formulate and use BIM adoption models for a uniform, critical and contextual analysis of project-level BIM adoption. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Africa; BIM; BIM adoption; BIM Africa; BIM implementation; BIM Nigeria; BIM projects in Africa; BIM projects in Nigeria; Strategic-contingent model of BIM adoption; Ten-factor theory of BIM adoption,Construction industry; Data mining; Digital storage; Housing; Information theory; Pattern matching; Africa; Building information modeling adoption; Building information modeling africa; Building information modeling implementation; Building information modeling nigerium; Building information modeling project in africa; Building information modeling project in nigerium; Building Information Modelling; Model implementation; Model programs; Nigeria; Strategic-contingent model of building information modeling adoption; Ten-factor theory of building information modeling adoption; Architectural design,Article

This new era of smart and sustainable urban systems is enabling transformative change in the way urban communities are interacting among themselves and with the built environment to become more sustainable and resilient to meet the demands of the growing urban population. Interoperability has been shown to be a major barrier for the seamless transfer of information between the heterogeneous landscape of the internet of things (IoT) and smart cities. In order to facilitate interoperability of these systems, this paper conducts a holistic review of principles, methods, and requirements needed to achieve interoperability of smart and sustainable urban systems. Significantly, the use of ontologies, namely the semantic web, has been shown to be the most promising method to enable interoperability.

Findings – The paper concludes that much has been recycled, often under amended titles. There is notable scope and advisability in paradigm shifts from reductionist/determinist approaches to stochastic approaches which accommodate complexities of interdependencies plus moves from “hard” positivism to “softer” constructivist perspectives. Research limitations/implications – The paper is limited in validity and reliability due to the methods employed. However, the conclusion does stress the essential of researchers being aware of and articulating the limitations of their work; the need for sound theoretical foundations is stressed in regard to both topics and methods.

I view interiority as a condition of the senses rather than an indoor place. Revelations of interiority can be discovered within the urban realm, in public spaces, and in intimate interior conditions. I am especially interested in “public interiority” or these cases of interiority that can be found in exterior urban places. Understanding interiority as a perceived condition grounds the built environment in phenomenology, varied human experiences, and everyday conditions. Herein, I begin with an ontology of interiority, which focuses on various ways of perceiving the nature of things—phenomenology, structuralism, and object-oriented-ontology (OOO). From there, I will analyse a taxonomy of public interiorities, including various strains of form-based, programmatic, atmospheric, and psychological public interiorities. Using real-world examples from my previous research in Bucharest, Romania, New York, and Knoxville, Tennessee as well as well-established examples in art and design, I will then analyse various urban experiences of interiority, and the way built conditions shape experience. In this way, I will bring the interior to the city.1. © 2020, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.

Furthermore, construction quality information is still recorded on paper, with the risk of document loss and data manipulation, jeopardizing quality accountability. Blockchain has attracted increasing attention from the construction industry because it can record information in an immutable and transparent way and automate some businesses with smart contracts. These properties can tackle information fraud and improve the automation level of OCQI. Unfortunately, very few documented blockchain solutions for OCQI exist. To fill the theoretical knowledge gap, the design thinking approach was adopted to present a blockchain-based conceptual framework. The consortium network and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) were selected as the suitable blockchain type and development platform for OCQI. The consensus process in HLF and smart contracts-based compliance checking are illustrated. Moreover, the benefits of integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and ontology technology with blockchain are analyzed in detail, which can facilitate the coevaluation of these three technologies. Finally, a prototype system was developed to vividly show the theoretical feasibility. The proposed blockchain solution can be fine-tuned and evaluated in future research.

The collaboration requires the iterative and coordinated exchange of information for significant improvement of the building design, construction and management. The successful representation of these information refinements enables the identification of the required level of detail (LOD) for data sharing parameters between the multiple disciplines. Since the last decade, LOD is a promising approach for efficient representation of semantically rich BIM data in different levels. Despite the improvement, there is a lack of efficient implementation in building lifecycle functionalities, because of their fundamental heterogeneity, versatility and adaptability. The proposed approach enables the representation of LOD-sensitive BIM data through the formal definition of ontologies. The paper validates this approach based on the concept of competency questions and their respective SPARQL queries. With the demonstration and validation, the paper provides the conceptual proof for the practical application of the developed approach.

They usually take off the quantities of material and related work items and assign appropriate unit costs. In this case, unit cost assignment is solely at the engineer’s professional discretion. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is widely adopted in the building construction industry. Tools can be used to automate material quantity, minimizing the time necessary for engineers to engage in the quantity measuring process. This function, however, does not provide any information on work items that are related to materials in the Bill of Quantity (BOQ). Thus, engineers still need to verify associated work items and assign unit costs. This research proposes an ontological inference of work item that enables an automated search of the most appropriate work items and their associated unit costs. This ontology contains semantic information for work items and work conditions, as well as a semantic reasoning rule that activates the ontology. A case study confirms that the proposed ontology and semantic reasoning rule can work in real-world situations. This paper contributes by eliminating subjective decision-making via search of appropriate work items for cost estimation and the use of BIM data extracted from IFCXML. The proposed ontological approach to building cost estimation will assist engineers in more readily using BIM data from IFCXML and will be helpful in automation of the whole estimation process. © 2015, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",BIM; cost estimation; ontology; work condition; work item,Budget control; Construction; Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Decision making; Engineers; Ontology; Semantics; Building construction industry; Building Information Model - BIM; Cost estimations; Ontological approach; Real world situations; Semantic information; Work condition; Work items; Architectural design,Article

The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) paves the way to address this challenge but the heterogeneity of the represented knowledge about these artifact systems poses a real problem. Ontologies can be considered as part of the solution to overcome the IoT's inherent hurdles. A wise option promoted by recent approaches is to design networks of complementary ontologies. However, different points of view are possible and such diversity could lead to interoperability problems. This article advocates for a networked ontology infrastructure conceived on a principled basis guided by documented judicious conceptualizations. In this regard, this survey points towards ontologies involved in conceptualizations of observations and actuations, where the utility of that conceptualization arises when some features of interest need to be observed or acted upon. For each of the reviewed ontologies, their fundamentals are described, their potential advantages and shortcomings are highlighted, and the use cases where these ontologies have been used are indicated. Additionally, use case examples are annotated with different ontologies in order to illustrate their capabilities and showcase the differences between reviewed ontologies. Finally, this article tries to answer two research questions: Is there a firm basis, broadly admitted by the community, for the development of such a networked ontology infrastructure for the observations and actuations in buildings? What ontologies may be considered helpful towards that goal?. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",actuations; actuator; BIM; Observations; ontology; sensor,,Review

The information needs for creation of digital twins of existing buildings are vast and as such none of the existing research approaches and/or algorithms are capable of holistic data collection to be used as input. A prevailing method for gathering geometrical data of existing assets is laser scanning, where a point cloud with high precision and high data volume is produced.

Their application varies from any approach structured on ontological commitment to meta-level ontologies serving for variety of purposes. This variety continues also in methodologies for constructing the ontologies. There are wide range of ontologies differing in size and complexity that are created with different design criteria. The main point with the ontologies is their structure and ability to serve for the intended purpose. This is only granted with the continuous evaluation of ontologies in the construction process, and also before release or reuse of the ontology. Ontology evaluation methods cluster around two concepts such as verification methods that ensure the structure of the ontology, and validation methods that examine their applicability in real world.

Objectives of this study are to underline the importance of ontology evaluation and to present an employed validation method used during ontology development for delay analysis. In this context, first; literature review on ontology evaluation is presented. Second, a delay analysis ontology is introduced with its basics to lay the foundations of the study. Cases taken from the Turkish construction industry are exemplified to explain the utilized ontology validation process. Comparison of the concepts in the constructed ontology with the expert reports written for each case is used to evaluate the ontology. Furthermore, alternative validation techniques are discussed as well as possible attempts to keep it responsive and up-to-date. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Four-dimensional (4D) simulation can be considered as a part of a claim management system for representing the responsibility and impact, and can be used as the main scheduling method of claims resolution. Building information modeling (BIM), 4D simulation, delay effects and causes (DEC), and claims are knowledge domains with active research in the construction industry, which are individually described in the literature using taxonomies and ontologies. However, there is a gap in integrating these ontologies in a more formal and overarching ontology-based approach to grasp essential concepts such as liability, causality, and quantum in a delay claim using 4D simulation. This article proposes a new method for using 4D simulation for visual analytics of delay claims based on an integrated ontology (called Claim4D-Onto), which includes a taxonomy of the quantum, causality, and assigned responsibility. A case study is used to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method. This method can provide a promising multidisciplinary tool for quicker and fair settlement of construction delay claims by facilitating hearing procedures and catalyzing pretrial negotiations. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Building information modeling (BIM); Delay claims; Delay effects and causes (DEC); Four-dimensional (4D) simulation; Knowledge representation and extraction; Ontology; Taxonomy; Visual analytics,Architectural design; Audition; Construction industry; Scheduling; Taxonomies; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction delays; Integrated ontology; Knowledge domains; Management systems; Ontology-based; Scheduling methods; Visual analytics; Ontology,Article

Currently, safety risk information related to decision making in metro construction is ill-structurally stored in various disordered formats, which hinders knowledge sharing and reuse. This study develops a domain ontology (SRI-Onto) to formalize safety risk knowledge in metro construction to support safety risk identification. An ontology development method with five steps is adopted. The SRI-Onto organizes safety risk knowledge into seven unified classes (i.e. project, construction activity, risk factor, risk, risk grade, risk consequence, and risk prevention measure). Defined classes, together with corresponding properties and relations, are coded using the Protégé platform. Finally, the SRI-Onto is evaluated theoretically and practically, using criteria-based and application-based evaluations respectively. Results indicate that the SRI-Onto possesses the necessary and essential criteria to serve the purpose of knowledge sharing and reuse. Further, the SRI-Onto is predicted to be generally applicable to safety risk identification of metro construction. © 2019",Domain ontology; Knowledge sharing and reuse; Metro construction; Safety risk identification,Construction industry; Decision making; Knowledge management; Ontology; Safety factor; Subways; Construction activities; Domain ontologies; Knowledge intensive process; Knowledge-sharing; Metro construction; Ontology development; Risk consequences; Safety risks; Risk assessment,Article

The primary aim of this study is to assess the communication performance prospects of BIM adoption among project teams in construction project delivery. Using deductive research design, a structured questionnaire survey was conducted on 52 experienced construction industry practitioners in the use of BIM tools in project delivery. The results indicated a significant influence of BIM adoption to accuracy, understanding, timeliness and improvement in the dissemination of shared project related information among project teams. However, contrary to opinion espoused in literature, there was no significant impact on overcoming underloading, overloading and gatekeeping issues in communicated information among the team.

The advantages, disadvantages, and future directions of ontology in road asset management, which relies heavily on acquiring and using data, are attracting much research attention over the past few years. This paper aims to provide a thorough and systematic review of ontology, including its development and implementation, in road asset management. In total, 45 journal papers and 12 conference papers published over the last 14 years were reviewed, sorted, and analysed. It is observed that: (1) most ontologies in road asset management target at traffic service and road assets; (2) most ontologies are designed to support the operation and maintenance stage; and (3) RDF-based language and OWL semantics are the two most popular ontology technique. From the review, it is found that the current development and implementation of ontology in road asset management also have a few limitations, including the lack of specific ontology engineering approach, the lack of an automatic mechanism to capture instances, properties and relationships, limited ontologies techniques in this field, and the lack of sharing and linking ontologies of different domains.

In recent years, state highway agencies (SHAs) have been facing the challenge of a shortage of experienced inspectors due to retirements, workforce downsizing, and resignations to take jobs in the private sector. There is a critical need to retain and manage the accumulated construction inspection knowledge (what, when, and how to inspect) and integrate this knowledge into the construction business process. This paper presents an ontological approach to managing inspection knowledge and the development of a risk-based digital inspection system integrated with the construction process. The developed system consists of five knowledge compartments: inspection activities prioritized based on risk; activity-centered pay items; inspection check items; detailed checks that include priority, frequency, object, attribute, and acceptance criteria; and training materials (optional). This risk-based system is designed to align with the construction process by connecting an activity to a pay item and that pay item to a check item, resulting in an automatically generated comprehensive inspection checklist for the activity. The optional training materials are designed to train inspectors in real time on an as-needed basis. Since risk is embedded in every knowledge compartment, this system not only automates and retains the inspection knowledge but also enables SHAs to allocate their limited resources to the most critical items. This system is currently being implemented by the Indiana Department of Transportation as a digital inspection protocol integrated in its e-construction process. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.",,Construction; Construction industry; Employment; Highway engineering; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Ontology; Automatically generated; Construction business; Construction inspection; Indiana department of transportations; Infrastructure construction; Inspection activities; Ontology-based knowledge managements; State highway agencies; Inspection,Article

CE analysis requires participation and brainstorming of domain experts and experienced practitioners; however, such a brainstorming session is usually time-consuming and cumbersome, making the CE analysis process inefficient. Therefore, an ontology-based representation model is proposed in this paper that can be applied to organize experts and practitioners' CE analysis knowledge as an ontology to benefit the reutilization of the knowledge. A case study is performed to demonstrate how the model works and can benefit the brainstorming session of a CE analysis process as well as the limitations of the model.

The enmeshment of the Web and various business processes has made it imperative to define business information in a format that facilitates machine-to-machine exchange and automated processing. The construction industry is not an exception; construction business processes depend on a diverse set of information sources. For efficient processing of the construction business information, it is necessary to publish the information in a format that allows computer applications to easily discover, query and share the information. Currently, the standard for representing, accessing, and sharing a building model is the Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) data model. Several researchers have investigated the limitations of IFCs data model for interoperability among heterogeneous software applications. This paper presents the results of an on-going research on an ontology-based approach to building information modeling to facilitate information exchange among different knowledge domain applications. The approach developed in this study is based on a shared building ontology that models building domain element types and element relationships. The information systems to be integrated should be modeled using the shared ontology; each knowledge domain adds its own element properties to the shared building ontology. SWRL rules are used for mapping element properties from one domain to another. An example demonstrates how the developed approach can facilitate project information sharing between design and estimating domains. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Application programs; Architectural design; Construction industry; Information systems; Information theory; Knowledge management; Ontology; Query processing; Building Information Model - BIM; Business information; Construction business; Distributed information; Heterogeneous software applications; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Information exchanges; Project informations; Information dissemination,Conference Paper

Many architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) organisations have invested heavily in information technology and KM systems that help in this regard. While these have been largely successful in supporting intra-organisational business processes, interoperability problems still persist at the project organisation level due to the heterogeneity of the systems used by the different organisations involved. Ontologies are seen as an important means of addressing these problems. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of ontologies in the construction project delivery process, particularly with respect to information and KM. A detailed technical review of the fundamental concepts and related work has been undertaken, with examples and case studies of ontology-based information and KM presented to illustrate the key concepts. The specific issues and technical difficulties in the design and construction context are highlighted, and the approaches adopted in two ontology-based applications for the AEC sector are presented. The paper concludes that there is considerable merit in ontology-based approaches to information and KM, but that significant technical challenges remain. Middleware applications, such as semantic web-based information management system, are contributing in this regard but more needs to be done particularly on integrating or merging ontologies. The value of the paper lies in the detailed exploration of ontology-based information and KM within a design and construction context, and the use of appropriate examples and applications to illustrate the key issues. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Construction industry; Data structures; Generation and dissemination of information; Knowledge management; Semantics,,Article

JHA commonly requires having brainstorming sessions to identify steps and associated hazards within construction activities. A company's personnel involved relies on their experience - and often also on the company's internal knowledge represented in the form of safety rules. The complexity and time consuming nature of JHA prevent safety personnel to react quickly to changes in the construction and the schedule. This paper presents a framework aiming to improve access to a company's JHA knowledge. The framework uses ontologies for structuring knowledge about jobs, job steps and hazards.

With more information being added to the model, the size of the model file and the difficulty to manipulate the model increase. However, different use scenarios may only require access to certain specific information stored in the model. In contrast with the ample research of ontology applications in construction knowledge management, research of ontology in construction modeling has been limited. Hence, the purpose of this study is to use ontology in the extraction of a partial building information model from the original complete model. The building information models covered in this study are in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format, which is a widely supported open BIM standard. An ontology TBox is developed according to the existing IFC schema specifications. For each specific IFC model, an ontology ABox is generated at run time, combining the ontology TBox and the IFC instances in the model. The ABox works as an index in the partial model extraction algorithm. A prototype Java program based on the algorithm was developed to demonstrate and validate the algorithm using both a sample model and an IFC model from a real building. The results indicated that the use of ontology provides a valid way to deal with the technical complexity of IFC models. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Building information modeling (BIM); Extraction algorithm; Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Ontology; Partial model,Building Information Model - BIM; Construction knowledge managements; Extraction algorithms; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Ontology applications; Partial modeling; Specific information; Technical complexity; Algorithms; Buildings; Computer software; Construction industry; Extraction; Java programming language; Knowledge management; Ontology; Architectural design,Conference Paper

This information is generally embedded into the BIM model as properties for parametric building objects, and is exchangeable among project stakeholders and BIM design programs - a key feature of BIM for enhancing communication and work efficiency. However, BIM itself is a purpose-built, product-centric information database and lacks domain semantics such that extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information for the purpose of construction workface planning still remains a challenge. Moreover, some information crucial to construction practitioners, such as the topological relationships among building objects, remains implicit in the BIM design model. This restricts information extraction from the BIM model for downstream analyses in construction. To address identified limitations, this study proposes an ontology-based semantic approach to extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information from a BIM design model. This approach allows users to semantically query the BIM design model using a domain vocabulary, capitalizing on building product ontology formalized from construction perspectives. As such, quantity take-off information relevant to construction practitioners can be readily extracted and visualized in 3D in order to serve application needs in the construction field. A prototype application is implemented in Autodesk Revit to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new approach in the domain of light-frame building construction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

They include incomplete structures that are still under construction, temporary structures and unsecured equipment that could be damaged during disasters, and hazardous materials that require special handling and storage. Therefore, to facilitate more resilient built environments, there is sorely a need to equip construction professionals with knowledge on disaster-resilient construction practices (DRCPs). To address this need, this paper proposes an ontology-based semantic model for representing and reasoning about the knowledge of DRCPs in construction job sites. The model is designed to serve as a foundation for a knowledge-based decision-making system on DRCPs. The model was implemented in a document classification module of the system, and the results of the experiment indicate that the model is applicable in supporting the classification of DRCP knowledge.

Currently these web services are used for exchanging messages with simple structure and small size. However, building information models often contain rich information and are huge in size. Therefore, retrieving and exchanging building information models using standardized web services technology is challenging. This paper discusses the usage of ontologies and context awareness in standardized web services technology to facilitate efficient and lightweight information retrieval and exchange. Ontologies for building information such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and aecXML have been developed for over a decade and become mature. These ontologies can be leveraged to structure the input and output messages of web services. On the other hand, context awareness not only provides data security according to user's location, time, and profile, but also enables retrieval and exchange of partial information models.

The multistakeholder context of the construction industry creates problems such as poor information interoperability and low productivity arising from difficulties in information reuse. Many researchers have explored the use of ontology to address these issues. This study aims to review ontology research to explore its trends, gaps, and opportunities in the construction industry. A systematic process employing three-phase search method, objective analysis and subjective analysis, helps to provide enough potential articles related to construction ontology research, and to reduce arbitrariness and subjectivity involved in research topic analysis. As a result, three main research topics aligned with the ontology development lifecycle were derived as follows: information integration based on ontology, ontology building, and ontology application. In addition, research gaps and the corresponding research agenda were identified. This detailed review provides the basis for further studies on the use of ontology in the construction industry.

This perspective is rooted in the notion that there is a fundamental dichotomy between people and nature. As Ingold (2000) points out, this is usually not concordant with the ontology of the Native societies of the Americas. In contrast, such ontologies view humans and their actions as part of the world, rather than as distinct or separate. How do we understand the creation of the built environment in a manner that does not categorically rely upon viewing such features as separate from the “natural” world? We advocate an approach that considers a multi-scalar consideration of both time and acts of creation (see Bailey 2007). In addition, we also suggest, following Ingold (2000, 2012), that such analyses situate these acts within the context of individuals dwelling in a broader landscape. Here, we define landscape as the various actions that are “collapsed into an array of features that must be understood as possessing different temporalities” that are “rooted in the movements of social life” (Ingold 1993: 162; Pluckhahn et al. 2015B: 20). By taking such a view, we rely on notions of structure, agency, and history (sensu Pauketat 2001a, 2001b) and a recursive view of the world, which includes anthropogenic constructions as a part of the world and not distinct from it (see Thompson 2014 for a discussion of these points). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Suzanne E.

The underlying architectural principles are very complex containing intrinsic 'parametric rules' based on both a philosophical and a building tradition. The parameters are in relation to the religious belief system as well as being derived from the bodily dimensions of the 'head' of a building. We aim at determining in which way these underlying building principles can be preserved by contemporary digital means. As a hypothesis we test a parametric formalization as CGA shape grammar made operative using the CityEngine. In order to formalize these building principles the following methods were devised: identification and collection of appropriate literature in English and Indonesian, partial translation of available material to English, field trips for contextual information and additional knowledge, and transformation of all sources of information into a shape grammar. An interactive visualization of ancient Balinese building principles is exemplified through the traditional house compound, the 'rumah', demonstrating the strength of a parametric approach. Moreover, it includes both, tangible and intangible heritage aspects by analyzing the appearance of (tangible) built heritage, as well as the (intangible) underlying philosophy and traditional knowledge.

It builds on Merleau-Ponty’s contention that mind, the human body and the environment are intertwined in a singular composite, and on Walter Benjamin’s suggestion that mind and city-form, in mutual interaction, through history, have set the course of civilization. Bringing together the fields of philosophy, urbanism, geography, history, and architecture, the book shows the association of existentialism with prevalence of mood disorder in Northern Europe at the close of Little Ice Age. It explains the implications of city-form and traces the role of the myths and allegories of urban design as well as the history of gender projection onto city-form. It shows how urbanization in Northern Europe provided easier access to shelter, yet resulted in sunlight deprivation, and yielded increasing incidence of depression and other mental disorder among the European middle-class. The book uses the examples of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky and Kafka, to show how walking through the streets, squares and other urban voids became the informal remedy to mood disorder, a prominent trait among founders of modern Existentialism. It concludes by describing how the connection of anguish and violence is relevant to winter depression in cities, in North America in particular. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,Regional planning; Built environment; Little Ice Age; Mental disorders; Middle class; Mood disorders; Mutual interaction; Walking through; Winter cities; Ontology,Book

The improvement of accessibility is conceived as a long-term objective, to be implemented in stages, according to an incremental development project model. Still today, when work is carried out to eliminate architectural barriers, designers adopt an approach that looks at the 'barrier/disability' binomial, identifying 'dedicated' solutions and tackling the problem of accessibility in relation to specific targets of users whose ability to access and use spaces and environments is assessed in relation to the capability of a person generically defined as 'normally able'. In contrast, in a barrier-free approach, designers are called upon to adopt a broader perspective, to look at the variety of people who make up a real community (extended user base), and to consider different physical conditions, ages, abilities and capacities (motor, sensory and cognitive), from the early stages of the project. In order to promote change and to impart this change of approach, the Autonomous Region of Friuli Venezia Giulia has envisaged integrated actions, aimed, as a whole, at accompanying the process that guides the project culture towards a progressive adherence to the methodological criteria of Universal Design, introducing, at the same time, support measures aimed at financing the Municipalities of the Region both for the preparation of barrier elimination plans (PEBAs) and the implementation of the interventions identified in those plans. Among the envisaged actions, the most important is a general accessibility mapping, which includes the adoption of a terminology system (accessibility ontology) integrated in a specific computer application, through which the municipalities will be able to detect architectural barriers, in a homogeneous way, over the entire regional territory. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.",Accessibility; Governance; Inclusive design tools,Accessibility; Built environment; Condition; Design tool; Governance; Inclusive design; Inclusive design tool; Incremental development; Integrated approach; Urban accessibilities; Design; construction work and architectural phenomena; disabled person; human; policy; Architectural Accessibility; Disabled Persons; Humans; Policy,Conference Paper

Charges of relativism, subjectivism, and indeterminacy were leveled against poststructuralism. But there were, and there continue to be, a set of theoretic and analytic signposts. Among those signposts there is, first, a critical stance toward meaning and interpretation, a position summarized by the term ""crisis of representation"". Second, poststructuralism issued a warning to those who would seek refuge from the above in the certainty of the self. Third and finally, there is a poststructuralist theory of power. The traditional objects of cultural geography - the built environment and landscapes - are taken as special cases of such power (i.e., as space/power). © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Cultural geography; Poststructuralism; Power,,Book Chapter

In this work, we aim to provide an initial approach to the question of how to model architectural data in a formal ontology structure and consider some of the problems involved. This question is challenging both for the inherent difficulties of the discourse to be modelled but also for the lack of available structured data sources that would distinctly represent the architectural perspective proper, as well as for the contentious nature of the definition of architecture itself. We, therefore, take the step of exploring in broad strokes the possible approaches to architecture, tracing the notion of architecture as idea, process or thing from the literature. On the basis of this enquiry, we propose a model of some top-level referents of architecture using FRBRoo, an extension of CIDOC CRM that can be used to model creative processes. We argue that with the addition of only four classes to this model, to capture certain architecturally specific concepts and activities, we are able to provide an adequate high-level first approach to this problem. Further, by connecting this work to the existing extension of CRMba, which models built work as a system of relations of filled and unfilled spaces, there is a sufficient high-level ontological structure to begin to test for its utility to explore the issues of the relation between architecture as idea, process and thing. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Architectural documentation; CIDOC CRM; CRMba; FRBRoo; Ontological modelling,,Article

The performance of proposed approaches relies on the existence of such similarity relationship and sufficient data for inferring it. However, in reality, many distributed systems do not have such presumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by associating the entities through affinity semantic (to what degree they are related in their application context). Through the analysis of a motivating example in building construction industry, this paper formally defines semantic association based on multiple-perspective domain standards. This paper hypothesizes that the establishment and the use of such standards can practically serve as a framework for reaching semantic interoperability between autonomous information systems.

Within a single industrial domain, there exist many taxonomies that are intended for different applications. Industry specific taxonomies often represent the vocabularies that are commonly used by the practitioners. Their jobs are multi-faceted, which include checking for code and regulatory compliance. As such, it will be very desirable if industry practitioners are able to easily locate and browse regulations of interest. In practice, multiple sources of government regulations exist and they are often organized and classified by the needs of the issuing agencies that enforce them rather than the needs of the communities that use them. One way to bridge these two distinct needs is to develop methods and tools that enable practitioners to browse and retrieve government regulations using their own terms and vocabularies, for example, via existing industry taxonomies. The mapping from a single taxonomy to a single regulation is a trivial keyword matching task. We examine a relatedness analysis approach for mapping a single taxonomy to multiple regulations. We then present an approach for mapping multiple taxonomies to a single regulation by measuring the relatedness of concepts. Cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient and market basket analysis are used to measure the semantic relatedness between concepts from two different taxonomies. Preliminary evaluations of the three relatedness analysis measures are performed using examples from the civil engineering and building industry. These examples illustrate the potential benefits of regulatory usage from the mapping between various taxonomies and regulations. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Domain specific ontology mapping; Regulation retrieval; Relatedness analysis; Taxonomy interoperability,Civil engineering; Conformal mapping; Construction industry; Industry; Information theory; Interoperability; Ontology; Regulatory compliance; Taxonomies; Applications.; Building industries; Cosine similarities; Do-mains; Domain specific ontology mapping; Government regulations; Information interoperability; Jaccard coefficients; Keyword matching; Market Basket analyses; Multiple sources; One ways; Potential benefits; Regulation retrieval; Regulation retrievals; Relatedness analyses; Relatedness analysis; Semantic relatednesses; Taxonomy interoperability; Laws and legislation,Article

The development of the Reno-Inst ontology relies on an approach combining input from experts and knowledge from related engineering documents.

This resulted in a recent shift in the philosophy outlining structural performance during large magnitude earthquakes from preventing collapse to providing highly resilient structures that are easier to repair after a major event. The change in performance philosophy requires the development of new and innovative structural systems that are capable of performing as desired. Research and development of such structural systems has been gaining attention in recent years and have shown significant potential. This study extends previously conducted research on suspended structural systems and floor isolation systems by introducing the analytical solution of buildings with suspended floor slabs with replaceable energy dissipation elements are numerically analyzed under dynamic excitations. The proposed systems comprise of a steel frame with floor slabs suspended from the beams using steel cables. There are two models considered in this study, first in which the slabs are suspended using fixed hooks attached to the beams, thereby coupling the motion of the slab to its immediate neighbor bottom and top floor. In the second model, the slabs are suspended from the beams using rollers such that the motion of the slab is only coupled to the floor immediately below it. Controlled energy dissipation in the structure is realized through the use of steel links that are installed between the bottom face of the suspended slab and the floor beam underneath the slab. The orientation and quantity of the steel links as well as the slab to be suspended in a typical frame is determined such that an optimal performance of the system is achieved. Suspending selected floor slabs and tuning the links for energy dissipation can significantly reduce the damage to the main structural frame and nonstructural components of the system, in addition to reduction in floor response. Moreover, post-tensioned cables are installed adjacent to the links to provide self-centering capability to the slab and reduce its residual drift. The optimal performance of the two models is evaluated for various size frames and found to out-perform a conventional frame in case of large structures. The study concludes with a few important design implications regarding the proposed system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Dynamic excitation; Suspended slabs; Tuned mass damper,Cables; Earthquakes; Energy dissipation; Geophysics; Ontology; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Dissipation elements; Dynamic excitations; Non-structural components; Research and development; Structural performance; Structure performance; Suspended slabs; Tuned mass dampers; Floors; dynamic response; earthquake engineering; model test; multistorey building; performance assessment; research work; seismic design; seismic response; structural analysis; structural response,Article

A vast amount of primary resources is spent during the construction of buildings, which uses 50% of raw materials taken from earth. The energy needed to heat, cool, illuminate, connect the fabric of the built environment contributes 36% to global energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions. At the same time, the building industry is one of the most fragmented, decen-tralized and diverse industries with nearly 3 million workers organized in 800.000 predominantly small enterprises. The vast spectrum of trades and sub-domains along with the diversity of its products ranging from residential buildings to tun-nels and bridges leads to a wide spectrum of information exchanged in temporary processes with fragile value chains. At the same time, the building sector as a whole is trailing in many productivity indices and in its state of digitalization. The potential to save energy and to contribute to the reduction of the car-bon footprint from the sector can be approached from a number of different angles: Improved design and planning for the few new and the many existing buildings; re-use and circular economy for the materials involved and synergetic effects through increased vertical and horizontal integration of processes, and subsystems. All this requires the integration of knowledge domains. 1.2 Semantic DTs in the Built Environment The individual cyberphysical sub-systems that comprise the built environment from individual buildings to vast and highly connected infrastructure networks including traffic, energy, water and waste networks, are designed, operated and maintained in completely separated, heterogeneous information silos with a very low rate of digitalization. Representing, monitoring, simulating and optimizing even of single nodes in these interconnected, multi-layered networks using dig-ital twins has only just begun. Within a single domain of these networks such as an individual building, a road-network or bridge, the current and past sys-tem states, their long-term monitoring and improvement requires comprehensive semantic models digital twin models. Such models are still in their infancy. Cur-rent and evolving information models are still mostly designed to capture static as-planned individual lifecycle stages, have bespoke and disparate insular solu-tions and little to no vertical and horizontal connectivity with other nodes in the network. Information exchange models for different aspects at various levels of granularity from geospatial superstructures (GIS) to building components (BIM) often have hundreds or even thousands of semantic entities and the sheer size of the structured vocabularies to describe products range in the tens of thousands of concepts which often differ on national or even regional levels. 1.3 Use cases and examples In the presentation an overview of ongoing research, development and standard-ization efforts regarding the creation, integration and interoperability of seman-tic Digital Twins for the built environment is provided. Concrete challenges and solution approaches of past and ongoing research from different use cases and application domains of Semantic Digital Twins for-the assessment and energy refurbishing of residential buildings-monitoring and predictive maintenance of bridges-road network interoperability with Linked Data across European borders are used to illustrate these challenges. These include the semantic lifting of legacy data models, the alignment and integration of vast domain vocabularies, multi-modal integration of heterogeneous status information (sensor, images, measure-ments) and ongoing efforts to create reference frameworks for semantically rich Digital Twins in the built environment.

Although this line of research is fundamental and has brought valuable contributions to this endeavor, it does not represent a solution to the challenge, semantic heterogeneity, since the performance of proposed approaches significantly relies on the degree of uniformity, formalization and sufficiency of data representations but most of today's independently developed information systems seldom have common knowledge modeling frameworks and their data are often not formally and adequately specified. Consequently, a workable solution usually requires interventions of domain experts. In human society, hierarchically structured standards (or taxonomies) for characterizing complex application processes and objects used in the processes are often used as a common and effective way to achieve some semantic agreements among stakeholders within a domain. This research hypothesizes that the establishment and the use of such standards can serve as a framework that can effectively facilitate the reconciliation of semantic heterogeneity in complex application domains. However, the reality shows that a comprehensive priori consensus is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reach. Consequently, various complementary and competing standards are often created and their constant-changing nature yields another level of challenge in achieving the hypothesis. This paper focuses on the development of methodology for bridging complementary standards within an application domain. It exemplifies such standards in building construction industry where interoperability problems are prevalent and human interactions are commonplace. It proposes a semi-automatic approach for semantically associating the standards to reduce costly human intervention in a workflow. The approach formalizes standards by using ontology and discovers their affinity (to what degree they are related with respect to their usage) from automated project document processing and semi-automatic domain expert inputs. A high-level architecture of an integration framework in web environment is suggested for depicting the role of the semantic association approach in the system.",Ontology-based knowledge extraction; Semantic interoperability; Semantic mapping; Taxonomy and standards,Data representations; High level architecture; Integration frameworks; Knowledge extraction; Semantic associations; Semantic heterogeneity; Semantic interoperability; Semantic mapping; Automation; Construction industry; Interoperability; Research; Semantics; Standards; Taxonomies; Semantic Web,Conference Paper

The structure of the ontology will be described, along with how regulations can be encoded, and subsequently executed.

Since model-based planning is becoming widely accepted in the building industry, we assume that planners are working on partial models stored in distributed and heterogeneous model databases. A main goal of this project is to provide the engineers with an integrated view on these heterogeneous models. To realize this, two levels of integration have to be considered: the access level integration and the semantic level integration. In the presented project, the problem of access level integration is approached by software agents. However, in this context the core problem is the inconsistent semantics of the heterogeneous building model. Thus, this paper focuses on the semantic level integration. Based on an analysis of different types of heterogeneity a method for semantic integration of building model data in civil engineering is presented on the example of fire protection engineering. To provide fire protection engineers with an integrated transparent view, an ontology-based approach has been developed. The problems of distribution and heterogeneity are approached by different solution layers, following the principle of separation of concerns. By those means, the integration effort can be reduced effectively and resources can be integrated flexibly into network-based building project organizations. © 2007 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Building industry; Building projects; Communication and collaborations; Fire protection engineering; Heterogeneous modeling; Heterogeneous models; Semantic integration; Separation of concerns; Civil engineering; Computer aided engineering; Construction industry; Fire protection; Planning; Semantics; Integration,Conference Paper

Much attention has been placed on characterizing of the genome in the past; nevertheless, genetics only account for about 10% of an individual's health conditions, while the remaining appears to be determined by environmental factors and gene-environment interactions. To comprehensively understand the causes of diseases and prevent them, environmental exposures, especially the external exposome, need to be systematically explored. However, the heterogeneity of the external exposome data sources (e.g., same exposure variables using different nomenclature in different data sources, or vice versa, two variables have the same or similar name but measure different exposures in reality) increases the difficulty of analyzing and understanding the associations between environmental exposures and health outcomes. To solve the issue, the development of semantic standards using an ontology-driven approach is inevitable because ontologies can (1) provide a unambiguous and consistent understanding of the variables in heterogeneous data sources, and (2) explicitly express and model the context of the variables and relationships between those variables. We conducted a review of existing ontology for the external exposome and found only four relevant ontologies. Further, the four existing ontologies are limited: they (1) often ignored the spatiotemporal characteristics of external exposome data, and (2) were developed in isolation from other conceptual frameworks (e.g., the socioecological model and the social determinants of health). Moving forward, the combination of multi-domain and multi-scale data (i.e., genome, phenome and exposome at different granularity) and different conceptual frameworks is the basis of health outcomes research in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Environmental exposure; External exposome; Ontology; Semantic standard,conceptual framework; environmental factor; genome; genotype-environment interaction; semantic standardization; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; built environment; cigarette smoking; conceptual framework; demography; dietary intake; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental health; exposome; exposure variable; genome; genotype environment interaction; human; ontology; outcomes research; patient coding; priority journal; Review; semantics; social capital; social determinants of health; social environment; standardization; causality; environmental exposure; female; male; semantics; Causality; Environmental Exposure; Exposome; Female; Humans; Male; Semantics,Review

Most previous work has gone into hardware abstraction, while service abstraction has been neglected. This paper presents an information discovery mechanism for BOSs that is based on an ontology which integrates with other semantic models used in the space. The built environment is characterized by extreme heterogeneity; no buildings are entirely alike. Equipment is replaced or updated, control systems and building functionality evolve, as applications, models, forecasters, and controllers improve. For services deployed in such settings to operate at a scale, they must be robust to change. Describing service interfaces using a semantic model, together with the physical context in a building, enables applications to query for their service dependencies. Applications then depend on an abstract query, instead of specific services. For evaluation, nine services running on models of the service ecosystems of three concrete buildings, are implemented, demonstrated, and discussed. Results show services have successfully been made portable and adapts to the changing environments of buildings. Merging and splitting services without code changes to depending services also work as intended, as well as increasing system resilience, by arbitrating similar services. © 2021 ACM.",Dependency Resolution.; Information Discovery; Ontology; Service Abstraction; Service Discovery,Abstracting; Buildings; Semantics; Building services; Cost-efficient; Dependency resolution.; In-buildings; Information discovery; Ontology's; Portable buildings; Semantic modelling; Service abstraction; Service discovery; Ontology,Conference Paper

This article presents a stakeholder-oriented approach, implemented in a planning support system, to provide stakeholders with specific information from their points-of-view, regarding the impact of energy strategies on their interests in the built environment. The approach is based on semantic web technologies, where an ontology has been developed to provide targeted information for different stakeholders while developing urban energy strategies. Measures to be implemented are defined. Stakeholders are identified and questions they raise for their decision making are listed, as competency questions of the ontology. Computation models to answer these questions are identified or developed, based on the data availability in the city. The semantics used in these models are then captured and classified within the ontology. Then the decision making knowledge of the stakeholders is integrated within the ontology, as inference rules. Finally, the ontology is used through a web-map-based interface. The proposed solution anticipates the potential decisions of the different stakeholders, easing the progress of the energy planning process, typically happening in workshops or forums in collaboration with different stakeholders. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Ontologies; Planning support; Urban energy planning,Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Energy management; Ontology; Renewable energy resources; Implementation process; Map-based interfaces; Planning support; Planning support systems; Renewable energy generation; Semantic Web technology; Specific information; Urban energy planning; Energy efficiency,Article

To reach this goal, it is necessary to use open standards for model exchange such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The non-profit organization buildingSMART defines this standard. IFC provides object types and attributes, which describe properties of objects. The IFC standard do not address possible values for attributes; but beside coordinated names for object types and attributes, coordinated values for attributes are required. This is necessary for the evaluation of digital models for different purposes. Several approaches in the fields of ontology and classification systems address this issue. However, at present time there is no clear distinction between prerequisites that modeled objects have to fulfill and products, which satisfy these requirements. Suppliers or construction companies at the interface between planning and construction propose products for the modelled requirements of the planning process. This paper describes an approach that bases on a dictionary, which provides standardized object types, attributes and values. A project database and a database with products, called supplier database, use this dictionary as a basis. Resulting from the modeling phase, the project database is ultimately mapped with the supplier database to propose products that fulfill the requirements. The approach presented in this paper can be regarded as a next step in using a standard that already exists: the buildingSMART Data Dictionary. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Building Information Modeling (BIM); BuildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC),Construction industry; Database systems; Information theory; Intelligent computing; Building Information Model - BIM; BuildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD); Classification system; Construction companies; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Interorganizational collaboration; Non profit organizations; Project database; Architectural design,Conference Paper

The methodological prisms of this paper are autoethnography and critical reflection. It is organised around enabling learners recognize the experiential, embodied urban spaces through the urban sensorium via real-life engagements with urban spaces, and creation of digital portfolios that map this learning. Findings from the learners’ knowledge of sensory learning, the city’s intersectional aspects, and the student’s embodied and emplaced self in built environments and digital spaces are analysed via cognitive and affective-reflection levels; the course instructor's reflection is analysed via a process-reflection level. These reflections hold implications for the pedagogy of urban studies in undergraduate classrooms by foregrounding spatiality and urban sensorium as significant critical and affective pedagogic tools.

While 3D city models, Internet of Things (IoT), and domain models are essential components of smart cities, the integration of IoT resources and 3D city models is a central information backbone for smart city cyber-infrastructures. However, we argue that most of the existing solutions integrating 3D city models and IoT resources are usually customized according to applications and lack of interoperability. To improve the interoperability between smart city modules, this study proposes a semantic-based methodology to integrate OGC CityGML and SensorThings API standards. Based on the data models from these two standards, this study proposes an integration ontology to connect information from these two standards. Due to the flexible definition of Thing in the IoT, the proposed ontology also considers multiple views of Thing. As a result, information from the CityGML and SensorThings API can be connected and queried via SPARQL queries. In general, this proposed integration ontology can facilitate the integration of IoT and 3D city models to achieve interoperable smart city. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",CityGML; Open standard; Semantic web; SensorThings API,Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Integration; Interoperability; Ontology; Semantic Web; Smart city; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D city models; Built environment; Cyber infrastructures; Digital system; Flexible definition; Internet of Things (IOT); Semantic Web technology; Sparql queries; Internet of things,Conference Paper

A comparison of the Late Formative center of Jatanca (300–100 bce) with the neighboring Moche site of Huaca Colorada (ad 650–850) in the Jequetepeque Valley of Peru will then demonstrate how radical transformations in architectural construction point to fundamental changes in how communities perceived and experienced the material world. The markedly different traditions of place making certainly suggest significant shifts in the meaning and political effects of built environments. Nevertheless, the article concludes with the important caveat that the pronounced architectural differences do not necessarily translate to major shifts in ontologies and constructions of personhood but more likely to transformations in ritual practices and political organization. Therefore, the comparison reveals the dangers of assuming that distinct materialities correspond to distinct ontologies or even distinct “materialisms.” Ultimately, the author argues that a focus on the materialities of place making, as opposed to generic interpretations of ontology, permits a more effective means of reconstructing historical process within the specific Andean context. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Andean; Materiality; Moche; Nonrepresentational theory; Ontology; Place making,,Article

Collectively the agents combine a range of specialist ontologies scoped to sub domains to realise individual and collective skills. Each ontology uses an appropriate knowledge representation to maximise simplicity while retaining adequate expressivity. A shared upper ontology is employed to support general communication and to provide 'common sense' knowledge. The agents in general are characterised by the strong notion of agency (as described in the literature), using the BDI (belief, desire, intention) model of agency as a powerful abstraction tool that is suited to applications where the complexity of systems and processes cannot be fully modelled using conventional techniques. The goals of the agents are, typically, to maximize some defined utility, and resulting behaviours are individual and collaborative, aligned and opposed. Knowledge retained, evolved and utilised by agents needs only to be generally locally consistent, and collectively the system can contain redundancy.

Postindustrial landscapes are, by definition, functionally and materially obsolete, and in many cases derelict and decaying. While they hold historical significance, these sites are often not widely perceived as valuable contributors to our heritage. Yet these landscapes persist. We argue that the material persistence of these features is the result of generally unrecognized processes of informal material conservation. In this paper, we outline a new framework, vernacular preservation, an ontology for heritage professionals to use in considering how to approach and recognize nonformal interventions that result in the protection of heritage resources. Here, we use the postindustrial landscape of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula-a former copper-mining district- to illustrate how vernacular preservation differs from formal historic preservation, reviewing the process of vernacular preservation and how it is activated in practice. Vernacular preservation constitutes perhaps the most traditional, common, and widespread mechanism of material conservation of the historical built environment yet has been largely invisible, little discussed, and undertheorized by the heritage preservation community. Understanding this preservation process begins by acknowledging its existence and by extending the heritage dialogue to include these underrepresented historical properties and their important role in defining postindustrial landscapes. We conclude the paper with a discussion on how this novel approach to thinking about preservation extends broadly to the field and should be given greater attention. © 2017 University of Pennsylvania Press.

They also have different requirements for accuracy, verisimilitude, and rendering performance. These various organizations have different standards and business processes for which they have developed their own paper and digital delivery procedures. To solve these problems, The National BIM standard (NBIMS) establishes standard definitions for building information exchanges to support critical business contexts using standard semantics and ontologies. This Standard forms the foundation for accurate and efficient communication and commerce that are needed by the construction industry. This paper investigates the general objectives of this standard, its relationship to structural engineering practice and focuses on the importance of involvement and contribution of structural engineering community to this standard. The standard is still in its infancy and the evolution and maturity of NBIMS will help to establish advanced design, communication and simulation tools that give the structural engineering community an opportunity to change the way it works in the industry, including open collaboration between stakeholders, design for optimum structure, increased energy efficiency, flexibility, constructability, comfort, and sustainability.

While there has been much discourse around the theoretical underpinnings of construction education, not much has been set in writing. A philosophical position has not always been to the forefront of those pioneering and well-intentioned construction educationalists. There has been, rather, a ‘systems thinking’ approach, a sense of wanting to prepare an educational experience that would equip the future leaders in construction to ensure they would develop the knowledge, skills and competences to take their place in an ever-changing architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. Now, at least around Europe, there is an ever-increasing attempt to identify the paradigms within which construction education sits comfortably, thus attempting to pave the way for the future. This could be called a philosophical positioning. There follows an exploration of the evolution of the education of the construction professional through a review of the literature and other sources in an attempt to make some sense of this journey. The paper also presents the discourse from the educational research perspective where the connection between the role of theory and philosophy has been a matter of discussion for many years. Biesta in his work calls for the intelligent use of theory and philosophy and advocates pragmatic positioning in regard to discourse. This pragmatic framework offers the freedom to gain control over what construction education constitutes as it offers a way of thinking that allows the educationalist freedom to challenge. What is presented and debated is the discussion that has been documented with a view to offering some perspective on its importance. Some philosophical perspective is also offered around the developments with the added suggestion that AEC is firmly seated in the ‘pragmatic’ paradigm. Much progress has been achieved to date but it is now time to offer a possible further step forward. While a pragmatic philosophical position is suggested it is not to imply that this is the only tool that might be used. The freedom to work within the pragmatic paradigm offers diversity that can draw together some of the thoughts that challenge and build the arguments about the role and position of theory in construction education. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Construction education; Philosophy; Pragmatism and research,"Construction; Ontology; Philosophical aspects; Architecture , engineering and construction industries; Construction education; Construction professionals; Educational experiences; Educational research; philosophy; Skills and competences; Systems thinking; Education; construction industry; education; philosophy; research; theoretical study; Europe",Article

This study argues that the presence of a man-made environment has been forgotten or falling into oblivion as the focus of theoretical investigation and exploration in architectural studies. Since most available theories see the built environment as a permanent object of the thinking subject, its theoretical construction is established from a subjective standpoint or worldview. There is a necessity for an alternative theory that sees the built environment as a phenomenon of the daily life-world experience, which happens and gathers people, places, and temporalities systematically and regularly (see Part I figure). These kinds of theories have been considerably marginalized and neglected. This study attempts to unveil and unfold the necessity for such an alternative theory of the built environment beyond Platonism. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Platonism; Prospective theory; The thing; Theoretical question; Vitruvian doctrine,,Book Chapter

As a result, one physical object yields several disciplinary representations, allowing designers to describe design options discipline-specifically and thus explore design differently. In a co-design approach, data from disciplines must be integrated and interoperable. But in current practice, interoperability problems between different software often hinders data integration. This paper presents a review and evaluation of interoperability paradigms in centralized, decentralized, and federated data, and it gives AEC application examples for each approach. It discusses data schemas (e.g. IFC) and interoperability tools (e.g. Speckle, BHoM). It also relates the interoperability tools to semantic web standards that are used to share information. It argues the advantages of federated data interoperability and suggests using design tools that employ such a mechanism. Furthermore, this paper suggests developing modular disciplinary ontologies to support collaborative design tools. Such federated interoperability, supported by modular disciplinary ontologies, can provide a solid ground to share and exchange data flexibly. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",alignment; Building Information Modelling (BIM); Co-Design; Data mapping; Interoperability; Knowledge representation; Ontologies,Architectural design; Construction industry; Data integration; Interoperability; Ontology; AEC industry; Building industry; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Co-designs; Data interoperability; Data mappings; Knowledge-representation; Modulars; Ontology's; Knowledge representation,Conference Paper

However, existing productivity estimation approaches are carried out in isolation thus limiting the sort of result obtained from such systems. Also, there is yet to be a holistic approach that enables productivity estimation using different metrics and integrates experts' knowledge to predict productivity and guide decision making at the early development stage of a project. This study aims to develop a method that can be used to generate multiple estimations for all these metrics simultaneously through linking their relationships. An ontology-based knowledge modelling approach for estimating productivity at the production stage for OSM projects is proposed. A case study of panel system offsite is used as a proof-of-concept for data collection and knowledge modelling in an ontology. Results from the study through the use of rules and semantic reasoning retrieved cost estimates and time schedule for a panel system production with considerations for different design choices. It is thus proven that systemising the production process knowledge of OSM methods enables practitioners to make informed choices on product design to best suit productivity requirements. The developed method helps to reduce the level of uncertainty by encouraging measurable evidence and allows for better decision-making on productivity. © 2019 Association of Researchers in Construction Management, ARCOM 2019 - Proceedings of the 35th Annual Conference.

Research showed that providing users with detailed consumption and appliance-usage data may engage them in energy efficiency activities. To do so, data analytic services must be deployed by third parties. These services require a huge amount of data from the users in order to offer high quality services. Nevertheless, users are usually reluctant to share their data especially if its private. This is the case of those measurements performed inside the buildings, as they may be an indicative of the occupants’ behaviour. In these scenarios, data sovereignty plays a key role because it provides to data owners a way to define data usage requirements and verify their compliance in a trustworthy way. In consequence, the owners’ predisposition to exchange their data is expected to increase. This article takes a step forward in the development of a trustworthy ecosystem for the built environment where data sovereignty is provided.

This research aimed at developing a method for slum detection based on the morphology of the built environment. The method consists of segmentation followed by hierarchical classification using object-oriented image analysis and integrating expert knowledge in the form of a local slum ontology. Results show that textural feature contrast derived from a grey-level co-occurrence matrix was useful for delineating segments of slum areas or parts thereof. Spatial metrics such as the size of segments and proportions of vegetation and built-up were used for slum detection. The percentage of agreement between the reference layer and slum classification was 60 percent. This is lower than the accuracy achieved for land cover classification (80.8 percent), due to large variations. We conclude that the method produces useful results and has potential for successful application in contexts with similar morphology. © 2016 Mapping Sciences Institute, Australia and Surveying and Spatial Sciences Institute.","image classification; informal settlements; object-oriented image analysis (OOA); ontology; Pune, India; remote sensing; Slums; spatial metrics; texture",detection method; image analysis; image classification; informal settlement; remote sensing; satellite imagery; urban area; India; Maharashtra; Pune,Review

In comparison to green-field construction projects, adaptive reuse projects require distinct stages, definition of interfaces, decision gates, and planning methods in order to secure the success of the building project. Unfortunately, little research has been done regarding establishing feasible systems for the planning, assessment, and management of adaptive reuse projects, leading to underperforming building projects outcomes. Interface management (IM) can improve renovation projects outcomes by defining appropriate ways to identify, record, monitor, and track project interfaces. IM has the potential of bringing cost and time benefits during adaptive reuse projects execution. The aim of this study is to develop a reference framework for implementing IM for adaptive reuse projects. First, the inefficiencies of redevelopment projects are explained inside of a circular economy (CE) context. Second, an ontology of IM for adaptive reuse projects is defined based on the current barriers to adaptive reuse and the most common interface problems in construction projects. Third, the defined ontology is expanded through a case study by showing examples of adaptive reuse barriers on a case project, and how IM could have been part of the solution for these problems. Finally, this study concludes with the suggestions on interface management systems (IMS) implementation for future adaptive reuse projects. © 2019 by the authors.",Adaptive reuse of buildings; Barriers in adaptive reuse projects; Circular economy; Interface management system; Interface problems in construction projects,,Article

Even though some technological innovations around Building Information Modeling (BIM) might have the potential to overcome these challenges, data integration across disciplines, companies and software solutions is yet to be solved entirely. Trending advancements try to enrich existing BIM data using Linked Data technologies to semantically describe the building information and facilitate data integration. By that, project data from different data sources is made available in an accessible format, so project participants can use it for their planning efforts. In this paper we explore the use of Linked Building Data (LBD) on a specific use case to answer the question of how the planning of Temporary Construction Items (TCIs) can be improved by integrating data and automating the demand calculation. A literature review concludes that TCIs only experience little attention in the current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the outcome of a project. Thus, the objective of this paper is to develop standard ontologies to provide a semantically rich terminology of the data and to propose a framework for TCI consideration within a BIM based project delivery system. A prototype solution is developed, taking formwork as a TCI representative. The result is a process for automatically creating a TCI utilization plan that quantifies the precise time- and location-based on-site TCI demand by integrating data from BIM, Location-Based Scheduling (LBS) and TCI information. Based on the results of prototyping and findings from expert interviews, this research integrates the solution into the process of construction and finally proposes two implementation scenarios for the solution – one being based on the current industry situation and one exploring the future vision of a more integrated and decentralized project delivery in the construction industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",BIM; Linked Building Data; Temporary construction items,Architectural design; Construction; Construction industry; 'current; Building Information Modelling; Linked building data; Location based; Project complexity; Project environment; Software solution; Technological innovation; Temporary construction; Temporary construction item; Data integration,Review

The concept of Job Hazard Analysis is commonly used to mitigate and control these occupational hazards. This technique analyzes the major tasks in a construction activity, identifies all potential task-related hazards, and suggests safe approaches to reduce or avoid each of these hazards. In this paper, the authors explore the possibility of leveraging existing construction safety resources to assist JHA, aiming to reduce the level of human effort required. Specifically, the authors apply ontology-based text classification (TC) to match safe approaches identified in existing resources with unsafe scenarios. These safe approaches can serve as initial references and enrich the solution space when performing JHA. Various document modification strategies are applied to existing resources in order to achieve superior TC effectiveness. The end result of this research is a construction safety domain ontology and its underlying knowledge base. A user scenario is also discussed to demonstrate how the ontology supports JHA in practice. © 2014 The Authors.

The main novelties are the introduction of a set of specific dependency patterns and the introduction of a partially revised TRIZ (Russian acronym for “Theory of Inventive Problem Solving”) ontology to classify the retrieved information. The proposed dependency patterns were manually extracted from a sample patents pool about waste recycling and reuse. The classification of the information is based on different classes: (1) what transformations can be carried out on the waste, (2) what technologies can be used to carry out these transformations, (3) what products can be obtained by transforming the waste, (4) what functions can be carried out by the waste, (5) with which technologies, and (6) on which entities. An automatic implementation of the proposed method, involving the manual check of the retrieved results, was tested through a case study about wood chip recycling and reuse. Compared to the dependency patterns from the literature, the proposed ones allowed to retrieve 28 % more pertinent information. This results mainly depends by better ability of the proposed patterns to better discriminate the relevant sentences from which to extract information, compared to the other patterns (i.e. + 40 %). The automatic classification of the information was also correctly performed: in almost each class, precision and recall were higher than 60 % and on average equal to 90 %. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Circular economy; Dependency patterns; Patents; Text mining,Patents and inventions; Recycling; Text mining; Wood products; Automatic classification; Automatic implementation; Circular economy; Different class; Extract informations; Precision and recall; Theory of inventive problem solving; Waste recycling; Classification (of information),Article

Thus, utilizing information systems (IS) in the construction industry has been an issue of great concern in order to achieve competitive advantages of an organization and also to enhance the effectiveness of construction projects throughout their life cycle and across different construction business functions. Nevertheless, despite recent outstanding advancement in building information modeling (BIM) technology, practical BIM implementation has not been widely proven to be economically feasible. It is noteworthy that economic feasibility can encompass quantified intangible benefits from BIM. Therefore, an assessment of BIM deployment from a holistic perspective is required in order to appraise the strategic and managerial advantages in a project or in an organization. Several studies have asserted strategic benefits of BIM adoption focusing on specific application areas (e.g. scheduling or estimating) or addressing limited technologies (e.g. visualization or ontology). However, real-world implementation of information systems truly comprehends complex issues such as corporate strategy, management effectiveness, internal policy and culture, and also technical capability together at the same time. In order to explore these complex issues for effective BIM implementation; this study examines five different real-world cases of BIM implementations. The five case studies from United States, Japan, and South Korea will be analyzed within two major BIM frameworks developed by the author. Project delivery methods, construction business functions, types of integration methods, and level of automation for BIM usage are the most important variables for comparing and analyzing the five cases in terms of BIM benefits. This study describes the different approaches and different benefits that BIM has to offer for practical applications. © 2015 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Competition; Construction industry; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Life cycle; Project management; Real time systems; Construction project management; Information and Communication Technologies; Management effectiveness; Organizational strategy; Project delivery method; Real-world implementation; Role of Information Systems; Technical capabilities; Architectural design,Book Chapter

Cosmos embraces everything, including the multifarious natural and material entities that make humans act. The book examines cosmopolitics in its relation to design practice. Abandoning the modernist idea of nature as being external to the human experience - a nature that can be mastered by engineers and scientists from outside, the cosmpolitical thinking offers designers to embark in an active process of manipulating and reworking nature 'from within.' To engage in cosmopolitics, this book argues, means to redesign, create, instigate, and compose every single feature of our common experience. In the light of this new understanding of nature, we set the questions: What is the role of design if nature is no longer salient enough to provide a background for human activities? How can we foster designers' own force and make present what causes designers to think, feel, and act? How do designers make explicit the connection of humans to a variety of entities with different ontology: rivers, species, particles, materials and forces? How do they redefine political order by bringing together stars, prions and people? In effect, how should we understand design practice in its relation to the material and the living world? In this volume, anthropologists, science studies scholars, political scientists and sociologists rethink together the meaning of cosmopolitics for design. At the same time designers, architects and artists engage with the cosmopolitical question in trying to imagine the future of architectural and urban design. The book contains original empirical chapters and a number of revealing interviews with artists and designers whose practices set examples of 'cosmopolitically correct design'. © Albena Yaneva and Alejandro Zaera-Polo 2015.
