132,"Qi, JD; Ding, L; Lim, S",A Decision-Making Framework to Support Urban Heat Mitigation by Local Governments,Article,,"Local governments have made extensive efforts to mitigate urban overheating, cool streetscapes and cities, and protect vulnerable people. However, there is uncertainty about which urban heat mitigation strategies (UHMSs) can provide better solutions for a specific urban context. There is a compelling need for local governments to automate the decision-making process and optimise the combination of UHMSs to maximise the mitigation outcomes for their cities. We develop a novel decision-making framework that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into urban heat mitigation in the built environment to enable an automated process of decision making. The novel decision-making framework comprises: the ontology-based knowledge representation of UHMSs and their relationships with urban contexts and performance assessment to share knowledge in urban heat mitigation domain; sensitivity analysis of the environmental, social and economic performance of UHMSs to get key variables for UHMSs; and genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimisation of UHMSs. The novel decision-making framework enables generating the context-based optimised UHMS combinations to support local governments' decision-making. The research outcomes will advance interdisciplinary knowledge about using AI techniques in the decision-making process for urban heat mitigation.",10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.106420,0.0

Motivated by the non-scalable character of conventional urban analytics methods, as well as by the interoperability challenges present in contemporary data silos, the illustrated system - coined SocialGlass - leverages the combined potential of diverse urban data sources. These include sensor and social media streams (Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare), publicly available municipal records, and resources from knowledge repositories. Through data science, semantic integration, and crowdsourcing techniques the platform enables the mapping of demographic information, human movement patterns, place popularity, traffic conditions, as well as citizens' and visitors' opinions and preferences about specific venues in a city. The paper further demonstrates an implemented prototype of the platform and its deployment in real-world use cases for monitoring, analyzing, and assessing city-scale events.",10.1007/978-3-662-47386-3_2,0.0

In the current heritage practice, knowledge representation and management have shown several limitations due to the difficulty of dealing with large amount of extremely heterogeneous data. On this basis, this research aims at extending semantic web approaches and technologies to architectural heritage knowledge management in order to provide an integrated and multidisciplinary representation of the artifact and of the knowledge necessary to support any decision or any intervention and management activity.

127,"Xu, Z; Wang, JL; Zhu, HX",A Semantic-Based Methodology to Deliver Model Views of Forward Design for Prefabricated Buildings,Article,,"Contemporary engineering in the construction field has put forward higher requirements on the value utilization of building information models, and as the prefabricated building is the core of construction industrialization, using BIM (Building Information Model) technology to realize the forward design of prefabricated buildings and maximize the value of BIM is in urgent demand in the current construction industry. However, in the application process of forward design, there is a lack of standardized implementation guidance and mature technical support, leading to many problems such as a redundancy of model information, heterogeneity of data information, and low efficiency of transmission. Based on this, this paper proposes a model view delivery method of forward design for prefabricated buildings. Firstly, a simplified assembly model and an assembly knowledge model are designed and extended with IFC (Industry Foundation Classes), then we realize the knowledge visualization expression by combining with an ontology semantic system. For the model view of a prefabricated building domain, this paper realizes the reusable concept module by ontology IDM (Information Delivery Manual) and properties selection of knowledge graphs, and then completes the model view delivery through data mapping and IfcDoc (Ifc Documentation Generator) tool output. Finally, the implementation model of information delivery management for forward design is built with model view delivery as the central link.",10.3390/buildings12081158,0.0

153,"Abdelmegid, MA; O'Sullivan, M; Gonzalez, VA; Walker, CG; Poshdar, M",A case study on the use of a conceptual modeling framework for construction simulation,Article,,"Construction simulation has been an active area of research in the last six decades. Nevertheless, there has been a gap between academia and industry in realizing the capabilities of simulation to support decision-making in construction. One of the well-recognized reasons is the difficulty of undertaking comprehensive simulation studies by construction practitioners, who usually lack sufficient knowledge and skills to adequately build simulation models. Efforts to bridge this gap have been focused on simplifying the computer coding and model implementation stages of construction simulation studies with limited research on the early stage of defining the model and abstracting the system, i.e., conceptual modeling. The conceptual modeling stage is known to be one of the most difficult tasks in a simulation study. Thus, several frameworks to support building conceptual models have been proposed in simulation literature. This study contributes to the research efforts to promote simulation in the construction industry through the adoption of a conceptual modeling framework. It demonstrates the application of the proposed conceptual modeling framework in a case study of piling operations. The findings of this paper reinforced the significance of conceptual modeling by confirming the role of the conceptual model as a communication link between stakeholders. Moreover, the conceptual model was used as a specification document for developing a flexible model that can be replicated in other settings. The use of a documented conceptual model assisted in managing the overall simulation study efficiently, which, in turn, lead to reductions in time and effort for different modeling activities.",10.1177/00375497211056087,0.0

32,"Xu, S; Liu, KC; Tang, LCM; Li, WZ","A framework for integrating syntax, semantics and pragmatics for computer-aided professional practice: With application of costing in construction industry",Article,,"Producing a bill of quantity is a knowledge-based, dynamic and collaborative process, and evolves with variances and current evidence. However, within the context of information system practice in BIM, knowledge of cost estimation has not been represented, nor has it been integrated into the processes based on BIM. This paper intends to establish an innovative means of taking data from the BIM linked to a project, and using it to create the necessary items for a bill of quantity that will enable cost estimation to be undertaken for the project. Our framework is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implementation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). In order to achieve this, a prototype is created that allows a cost item for the bill of quantity to be spontaneously generated, by means of the semantic web ontology and a forward chain algorithm. Within this paper, 'cost items' signify the elements included in a bill of quantity, including details of their description, quantity and price. As a means of authenticating the process being developed, the authors of this work effectively implemented it in the production of cost items. In addition, the items created were contrasted with those produced by specialists. For this reason, this innovative framework introduces the possibility of a new means of applying semantic web ontology and forward chain algorithm to construction professional practice resulting in automatic cost estimation. These key outcomes demonstrate that, decoupling the professional practice into three key components of syntax, semantics and pragmatics can provide tangible benefits to domain user.

It is one of the primary causes of project schedule and cost overruns. Many studies on defect causation analysis and management system have been conducted to facilitate defect measures and rectifications as well as to reduce the reoccurrence of the defect. However, those studies did not sufficiently consider the relationship of defect information flow in the construction process, which resulted in reactive rather than proactive defect management plan. This paper investigates the issues and needs of current defect management practices in the construction industry. It also presents a conceptual system framework for construction defect management that integrates ontology and augmented reality (AR) with building information modeling (BIM). The following three main technical solutions are proposed in the system framework: 1) defect data collection template to assure data quality and accuracy; 2) defect domain ontology to search and retrieve project or work-specific defect information; and 3) AR-based Defect Inspection System to support field defect management. It is envisaged that the system framework and solutions could enable proactive reduction of the defect occurrence during the construction process and that could greatly improve current defect management practices in the construction industry.

This paper aims to develop a new information management method to cope with the risk problems involved in dealing with such data, based on domain ontologies of the construction industry, to help manage PPP risks, share and reuse risk knowledge. Design/methodology/approach Risk knowledge concepts are acquired and summarized through PPP failure cases and an extensive literature review to establish a domain framework for risk knowledge using ontology technology to help manage PPP risks. Findings The results indicate that the risk ontology is capable of capturing key concepts and relationships involved in managing PPP risks and can be used to facilitate knowledge reuse and storage beneficial to risk management. Research limitations/implications The classes in the risk knowledge ontology model constructed in this research do not yet cover all the information in PPP project risks and need to be further extended. Moreover, only the framework and basic methods needed are developed, while the construction of a working ontology model and the relationship between implicit and explicit knowledge is a complicated process that requires repeated modifications and evaluations before it can be implemented. Practical implications The ontology provides a basis for turning PPP risk information into risk knowledge to allow the effective sharing and communication of project risks between different project stakeholders. It can also have the potential to help reduce the dependence on subjectivity by mining, using and storing tacit knowledge in the risk management process. Originality/value The apparent suitability of the nine classes of PPP risk knowledge (project model, risk type, risk occurrence stage, risk source, risk consequence, risk likelihood, risk carrier, risk management measures and risk case) is identified, and the proposed construction method and steps for a complete domain ontology for PPP risk management are unique. A combination of criteria- and task-based evaluations is also developed for assessing the PPP risk ontology for the first time.",10.1108/CI-02-2022-0029,0.0

Domain ontologies are a widely used tool for the formal definition of a field of knowledge, which facilitates the exchange of information in heterogeneous systems through technologies such as the Semantic Web. The proposed mapping can be used to enrich information and improve data integration in systems based on semantic tools that manage services or maintain facilities and building infrastructures.

On the basis of identifying intra-relationships between causations, intra-relationships between accidents, and inter-relationships between causations and accidents, this research aims to develop a subway construction safety risk network (SCSRN) with two layers of 56 causations and 44 accidents. Topological features were identified to denote the roles of individual nodes of causation or accident in the total network of SCSRN. Robustness assessment was conducted in the consideration of three strategies of node failure, namely, random attack, deliberate attack according to the decreasing order of node's total degree, and deliberate attack according to the decreasing order of node's betweenness centrality. The results indicated that the second strategy was more efficient in reducing the connectivity of SCSRN. It was suggested that managers should not pay equal attention to causations and accidents with unequal roles in the SCSRN. This research was beneficial to capturing complex cause-and-effect relationships of accident occurrence at subway construction sites. It can provide the opportunities for optimizing safety-related decisions on the elimination of causations and controlling accidents with high efficiency on site.",10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105261,0.0

Previous research has outlined a broad range of technological advances facilitating the management of the FFH safety risk. However, the extant literature lacks a comprehensive assessment to investigate the contribution of various FFH technologies, as well as their implementation feasibility on construction sites, which provides rationale for this study. The study aims to assess recent safety technologies which can be used to control the risk of FFH on construction sites, especially in urban building construction projects. A scoping review was conducted to identify such technologies and provide insight into their application in the construction industry. As a result of searching Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases between 2010 and 2021, a total of 86 representative studies were selected and reviewed. Following this stage, an assessment of their feasibility was carried out based on a set of criteria from the literature.

Most of them on this issue have been emphasized the necessity and utilization of information, rather than how to exchange, share and transfer safety data efficiently in the construction industry. With this regard, this paper proposes the Social Network System for Sharing Construction Safety & Health Knowledge (SNSS), which utilizes state-of-the-art of semantic wild web and ontology construction technologies for better communication and representation for construction safety information. The SNSS is developed on the basis of safety semantic wiki template (SSWT), which consists of the following three modules: 1) A Safety information module (SIM) which upload common accident and hazard information for sharing; 2) A Safety knowledge module (SKM) where the safety information is refined, confirmed and transferred to safety knowledge; 3) A Safety dissemination module (SDM) which allows its users to monitor, manage and retrieve safety information and knowledge easily. The SNSS is tested by a scenario of using falling accident information by which the potentials and limitations of the system were addressed.

Typically, construction robots are usually pre-programmed for a single task, such as painting. Their behavior is fixed when they leave the factory. However, it is difficult to pre-program all capabilities (referred to as workplace skills) that construction workers may require. Construction robots are expected to have the same ability of skill learning as human apprentices, allowing them to acquire a wide range of workplace skills from experienced workers and eventually complete relevant construction tasks autonomously. However, workplace skill learning of robots has rarely been investigated in the construction industry. This survey reviews state-of-the-art approaches to help robots learn skills from human demonstrations. To begin, the workplace skill is represented as 'Know That' and 'Know How' problems. 'Know That' is a high-level task planning ability aimed at understanding human activities from demonstrations. 'Know How' refers to the ability to learn specific actions for completing the construction task. Sematic methods and learn from demonstration (LfD) methods are reviewed to tackle these two problems.

In the case of healthcare facilities, where the policy environment is characterized by change on several fronts, fixed requirements could constrain their evolvability and sustainability. Future-proofing is a response to uncertainty whereby a physical structure is designed to respond to future changes in requirements, change of use, strategic perspectives, business drivers, new policies and changing climate. The paper investigates the causal powers that explain how and why future-proofing decisions achieve a sustainable outcome. A critical realist lens is adopted to develop a configurational perspective of future-proofing design evolution. Critical Realism's open systems ontology of social reality can account for the fact that outcomes are not predictable and can better explain the nature of causation in complex social interactions such as construction projects. A case study research design was conducted comprising in-depth interviews with healthcare construction professionals in a UK setting. The study contributes to the sustainability literature by offering four generative mechanisms of future-proofing decision making and how they contingently lead - or fail to lead - to future-proof outcomes.

As matter of fact, few methods exist that can help designers in such task, despite its importance in the definition of the building quality; norms and regulations, personal designer's experience, post-occupancy evaluation have shown their limit to provide predictive models of the complex phenomenon of human behaviour in built environments. With the increasing of computing power, virtual simulation techniques have been introduced in building design to control, manage and predict complex systems of building performances such as its energy or structural behaviour, but not to representation of buildings while-in-use. The Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) paradigm has been applied in building design to simulation of specific aspects of human behaviour and in specific occurrences (for instance in fire egress simulations), while a more extensive representation of users actions, behaviours, and activities is still missing. In order to overcome this lack, in this paper we propose to support agent-based simulation with a knowledge base, developed by means of ontologies and able to provide a structured system of data about human-building interaction, useful as start hypotheses for Agent-based Simulation. For its development, we rely on the general template of building knowledge management already proposed by the research group (Carrara et al., 2009), extending it to representation of the whole system users-built environment. The proposed general template, configuredby the meaning -properties - rules structure, allows the formalization of users/agents entities, whose parameter, attributes and behavioural rules can encode several `aspects' of real users and their interactions with the other entities (building components, furniture, other people) in a built environment.

For this purpose, two models were developed that can retrieve appropriate cases according to user intentions and automatically analyze tacit knowledge from construction accident cases. In the retrieval model, the query is expanded using a construction accident case thesaurus. Ranking is calculated using Okapi BM25 and weighting according to the thesaurus. In the analysis model, knowledge is automatically extracted using rule-based and conditional random field (CRF) methods. The proposed system can retrieve results that are 97% relevant to the accident cases the user intended and can automatically analyze knowledge with accuracies of 93.75% and 84.13% for the rule-based and CRF models, respectively. The results demonstrate the potential of knowledge discovery from accident reports for more-effective safety management.",10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001625,0.0

We also suggest that it is important to account for the purpose of engineers and the context they work in while representing and formalizing knowledge. Based on the concepts of ontology, logic, purpose, and context, we discuss different possible research methods and approaches that scholars can use to formalize complex engineering knowledge and to validate whether a specific formalization can support engineers with their complex tasks. On the grounds of this discussion, we suggest that Advanced Engineering research efforts should be conducted in a bottom-up manner closely involving engineering practitioners.

The rapid development of e-commerce offers efficient and effective solutions, however the large number of participants in the construction industry means that the data involved are complex, and problems arise related to volume, heterogeneity, and fragmentation. Thus, the sector lags behind others in the adoption of e-commerce. In particular, data integration has become a barrier preventing further development. Traditional e-commerce platform, which considered data integration for common product data, cannot meet the requirements of construction product data integration. This study aimed to build an information-integrated e-commerce platform for industrialized construction procurement (ICP) to overcome some of the shortcomings existing platforms. We proposed a platform based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) and linked data, taking an innovative approach to data integration. It uses industrialized construction technology to support product standardization, BIM to support procurement process, and linked data to connect different data sources. The platform was validated using a case study. With the development of an e-commerce ontology, industrialized construction component information was extracted from BIM models and converted to Resource Description Framework (RDF) format. Related information from different data sources was also converted to RDF format, and Simple Protocol and Resource Description Framework Query Language (SPARQL) queries were implemented.

In prefabricated construction, there are exacting requirements for information sharing. Also, data in a prefabricated component supply chain tend to be dispersed in design, production, transportation and other stages. In other words, such data are significantly multi-source heterogeneous. Without an effective way of participating in supply chain dynamic collaboration, decision-making at various stages and resource allocation can be extremely challenging. This paper proposes a decision support framework for prefabricated component supply chain based on ontology and multi-agent. The framework comprises the ontology layer (i.e. provides data support for the model), the agent interaction layer (i.e. serves as the communication hub to coordinate the data transmission between modules), and the agent simulation layer (i.e. simulates interaction behavior of participants, and supports decision making). Using the Shanghai Chenxiang Road Station complex project as a case study, the paper demonstrates the validity of the proposed ontology and multi-agent based decision support framework.",10.1007/s10796-019-09941-x,0.0
49,"Howsawi, A; Zhang, JS",An Ontology to Support the Move towards Sustainable Construction in Saudi Arabia,Proceedings Paper,,"Over the past two decades, the construction industry has experienced a lot of positive changes in Saudi Arabia. Governments and lawmakers have come up with various regulations that govern the construction industry, such as the Saudi Building Code. These regulations have been effective in creating legal boundaries and rules for contractors and developers to abide by. However, critics and environmentalists suggest that contractors still have undertaken various activities that are of great harm to the environment. For example, wasted materials left in the surrounding area of construction job sites are a great cause of environmental pollution. Such pressure has led to the pursuit of a new trend in the construction industry known as sustainable construction. Sustainable construction entails the use of processes and materials that have little or no negative impact on the environment, and the construction of tall and complex structures that are important to accommodate the ever-growing population. In spite of the universal agreed guidelines for sustainable construction, detailed implementation methods depend on local contexts. This paper presents an initial effort in creating an ontology that describes the potential sustainable construction strategies in Saudi Arabia, to create a guidance for improving the energy efficiency of buildings in Saudi Arabia. The ontology is expected to (1) help create construction job sites that are not only environmental friendly, but also better serve the interests of all stakeholders; and (2) help reduce energy usage in buildings.",,

Several alignment variants are usually created and each one is intensely scrutinized. Variants often have individual advantages and disadvantages and can lead to different constructive designs of a tunnel. In order to find the best alignment possible the variants have to be analyzed and evaluated based on requirements and evaluation criteria, such as safety, cost, built environment and operational requirements. To perform this evaluation and to enable comprehensive decision making, a holistic planning environment is examined that includes documents and models of different domains. In general, these domain specific data differ schematically and semantically, which consequently makes it challenging to combine and compare such diverse data. For this purpose, information from different sources must be linked and evaluated in a structured way. In particular, spatial relationships have to be investigated. Therefore, in this paper, ontology databases are utilized to merge BIM and GIS at data level to create an integrated model of the entire tunneling project. Relevant information for decision-making can then be derived, such as the location of private and public buildings that are in a certain vicinity of the planned alignment. On the one hand, the implementation of queries is a popular and frequently used approach to check for semantic properties. On the other hand, using a query language to derive information from geometric data can be challenging, due to the necessity of processing geometric data prior to and during query execution. Additionally, geometric definitions can differ in the considered coordinate reference system, the dimension or the structure. To handle geometry information by employing query languages, representations are methodically transformed to well-known text literals. A simplified and uniform geometric representation can be utilized for spatial reasoning, for example by adopting GeoSPARQL methods.",10.1016/j.aei.2022.101728,0.0

The three objectives of this paper are to: define eco assets explicitly to reach a common understanding of the terms; evaluate the ontology; and discuss a potential area of application. Design/methodology/approach - A seven-step methodology was used to develop the proposed ontology: define the scope; develop the eco asset meta model (EA_MM), define taxonomy, code ontology, capture ontology, evaluate ontology and document ontology. Findings - The EA_MM was developed to represent eco asset domain knowledge, which was further extended to develop the EA_Onto, explicitly defining the eco asset knowledge in asset management. As a part of evaluation, it was found that the knowledge representation is consistent, concise, clear, complete and correct. Practical implications - Theoretically, the proposed ontology is a significant contribution to the body of knowledge in asset management. Practically, the knowledge representation provides a common understanding of eco assets for asset management experts. In addition, it will be used in applications for effective eco asset management. Originality/value - The current literature lacks explicit declaration of eco assets, how they are related to built environment for effective integration and how asset management functions are to be applied to accomplish effective eco asset management.

The proposed solution is relevant for several manufacturing environments. However, in dynamic, semi-structured manufacturing environments that the workstations are not fixed but dynamically change over time and in which the workers are mobile and not static to some predefined workstations, the utilisation of context-aware information delivery is considered as even more relevant.

The two objectives are: first, to describe how different ontologies developed as part of this research support the design of message templates (MTs) that were implemented in the AIIS; and second, to explain the development and application of the prototype system for tangible capital asset (TCA) reporting. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed system was developed in the MS SharePoint platform using a four-step methodology: create a web site and library; review and modify MTs; design and configure workflows; and add functionalities. Findings - First, the architecture, methodology, and evaluation of the two ontologies: Transaction Domain Ontology and Tangible Capital Asset Ontology, developed as part of this research work were briefly introduced to describe how both the ontologies supported the design of MTs that were implemented in the AIIS. Second, the AIIS was successfully developed and applied in the domain of infrastructure management for the Asset Inventory and Condition Assessment Reporting. Practical implications - The development of the AIIS would enable industry experts to exchange the tangible capital information. The built-in search engine and history services would help the experts to search a transaction and track the transaction history. The real-time visualisation of the data would help in decision making. Originality/value - Infrastructure agencies use diversified information systems to manage infrastructure systems.

Part of this data concerns performance metrics expressed among others in terms of cost, energy consumption or system reliability. Such performance values are the focus of project stakeholders who try to optimize them already in building design phase. These values are computed by simulation software that reuses a subpart of the BIM data as input. This provides a better view of building performances but less on threats and underperformances in the building life cycle.

This paper aims to use Semantic Web technologies for facilitating information exchange within existing building projects. Design/methodology/approach In real-world building projects, the construction industry's information supply chain may initiate from near scratch when new building projects are started resulting in diverse data structures represented in unstructured data sources, like Excel spreadsheets and documents. Large-scale data generated throughout a building's life-cycle requires exchanging and processing during an asset's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase. Building information modelling (BIM) processes and related technologies can address some of the challenges and limitations of information exchange and interoperability within new building projects. However, the use of BIM in existing and retrofit assets has been hampered by the challenges surrounding the limitations of existing technologies. Findings The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it briefly outlines the framework previously developed for generating semantically enriched 3D retrofit models. Secondly, a framework is proposed focussing on facilitating the information exchange and interoperability for existing buildings. Semantic Web technologies and standards, such as Web Ontology Language and existing AEC domain ontologies are used to enhance and improve the proposed framework. Originality/value The proposed framework is evaluated by implementing an example application and the Resource Description Framework data produced by the previously developed framework.

Thus positive and continuous actions need to be taken to preserve the heritage buildings or else a country might lose its cultural heritage value. In managing historic buildings, managers are often faced with complex decision-making process due to limited or unavailability of reliable information. The absence of such information influenced the way decision making and problem-solving made by the managers. This paper aims to highlight the potentials of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a decision support system for cultural heritage management. An embedded case study was conducted on Istana Balai Besar Kota Bharu, focusing on the changes of the historical building's layout to demonstrate the ontology. A measured drawing dated back in 1976 was used together with the terrestrial laser scanning activity performed presently on the physical building in creating a model in BIM environment. The result gives an overview about tracking information on changes within a historical building as part of cultural heritage management. This paper finds that by modelling the data captured by the 3D laser scanner and utilizing the existing data, BIM is capable of helping managers to retrieve, analyze and store important information in a more efficient and productive process. This exploration is substantial as a precursor to a much broader study on BIM for cultural heritage in the Malaysian context.

The developed ontology, named Safety and Health Exchange (SHE), comprises eight concepts and their relationships required to identify and manage safety risks in the design and planning stages. The main concepts of the developed ontology are identified based on reviewing accident cases from 165 Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) and 31 Press Releases from the database of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in the United Kingdom. Consequently, a semantic mapping between the developed ontology and IfcOWL (the most popular ontology and schema for interoperability in the AEC sector) is proposed. Then several SPARQL queries were developed and implemented to evaluate the semantic consistency of the developed ontology and the cross-mapping. The proposed ontology and cross-mapping gained recognition for its innovation in utilising OpenBIM and won the BuildingSMART professional research award 2020. This work could facilitate developing a knowledge-based system in the BIM environment to assist designers in addressing health and safety issues during the design and planning phases in the construction sector.",10.36680/j.itcon.2022.005,0.0

The importance of classification is growing as building projects become more international, generating more data that rely on automated processes, which help in making better decisions and operating devices. Different classification systems have been developed around the world. Each national construction information classification system (NCICS) aims to classify information on the built environment and thus meet national needs and ensure compliance with the principles of regional and international building information systems. The research purpose of this paper is to present a comparative assessment of two construction information classification systems, CCI and Uniclass 2015. The following methods were used: the expert assessment of NCICS alternatives; the assessment of NCICS alternatives; and a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of NCICS alternatives. We concluded that in the initial phase of NCICS development, CCI ontologies should be adopted as a base consisting of construction entities, spaces, and elements, with the gradual addition of complexes of buildings and infrastructure, along with roles and phases of the building life cycle (BLC). An explanatory NCICS development note should be drawn outlining the principles of classification and identification; the ontological structure; development and updating possibilities; methods of integrating existing national and international classification systems; and methods of integrating data of construction products, time, cost, or other individual characteristics.",10.3390/buildings12050656,0.0

Specifically, by preventing fall accidents, the death rate from accidents can be reduced by 50%. Fall protection is required to prevent fall accidents, and investigating the reinforcement of the worker's safety harness and hook fastening becomes imperative. This requires automation of computer vision confirmation of the safety harness and hook fastening. As the accident risk can be reduced by an effective safety culture in the system, it is necessary to monitor safety on site through a construction safety automation system. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a computer vision process for safety harness and hook for preventing fall accidents in South Korea's construction industry. This study focuses on system scaffolds that are widely used at construction sites. The application of this methodology to sample sites and field cases established its applicability. The proposed computer vision application methodology will serve as the foundation for visualization research in the construction industry, and image recognition will help reduce the safety accident rate. Accidents caused by failure to use a safety harness and hook can be reduced in South Korea as well as globally.

Current BIM has limited ability to represent dynamic semantics, social information, often failing to consider building activity, behavior and context; thus limiting integration with intelligent, built-environment management systems. Research, such as the development of Semantic Exchange Modules, and/or the linking of IFC with semantic web structures, demonstrates the need for building models to better support complex semantic functionality. To implement model semantics effectively, however, it is critical that model designers consider semantic information constructs. This paper discusses semantic models with relation to determining the most suitable information structure. We demonstrate how semantic rigidity can lead to significant long-term problems that can contribute to model failure. A sufficiently detailed feasibility study is advised to maximize the value from the semantic model. In addition we propose a set of questions, to be used during a model's feasibility study, and guidelines to help assess the most suitable method for managing semantics in a built environment.",10.3390/buildings4040849,0.0

The goal is a mechanism that delivers knowledge, especially in the domain of practical experience, more efficiently and effectively than simple information retrieval searches.

It is understood that individual simulation participants perform their simulation services in separate environments, bartering service exchange relationships to get what they need to resolve their part of the problem. This is the communication gap between the scientists on one side and the end users who need to understand knowledge and employ it on the other side. The authors envision a distributed simulation service software environment running in parallel with the activities of simulation participants. DOSE has lent itself to integrate interdisciplinary participants through an infrastructure that has three basic building blocks, namely: modularity, scalability, and interoperability. The modular, object-based, design of DOSE architecture is described in terms of key functionalities of four distinct layers, namely: resource, core, domain, and interface layers. DOSE scalability in terms of urban system size and participant third-party application complexity is enabled through the interface layer. A message passing model is developed using the Message Passing Interface standard and a control room is provided to schedule the interaction /communication among model processes. DOSE interoperability with the vulnerability analysis third-party applications is enabled through the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard. An adopted analogy between DOSE and construction industry is employed to provide interpretation and implementation for DOSE interoperability. While interfacing lFC object model to solve DOSE interoperability questions, an extension model for the structural view of IFC is proposed and accepted by the International Alliance for Interoperability.

Current modeling approaches for this context address each level and domain separately, thus preventing a structured and comprehensive approach to a unified energy representation. Moreover, current approaches make it difficult to keep the consistency between the energetic data through levels, sub-domains, and across stakeholders. Starting from an analysis of ontologies at the state-of-the-art, this paper shows how DogOnt can be used as a foundation towards a shared and unified model for such a context.

After 1955, Empson emerged as a leading skeptic of literary high modernism by means of the novel analogy argued in his essay, Donne the Space Man (1957): namely, that literary depictions of space in Donne's early poetry, athwart high Church doctrine, paralleled contemporary skepticism, in Empson's own time, about interpretive orthodoxies within Eliotic criticism and among the American New Critics. With its focus upon what he calls space travel, Empson's exegesis in Donne the Space Man (1957) pioneered what today one may call the scalar turn in literary modernist criticism. In Empson's case, a scalar criticism endorsed Donne's search for a more generous plurality of critical worlds and embraced cosmological scale irreducible to the more dogmatic worldview of Christian-inspired theorizations then prevailing. Re-reading the Donne the Space Man essay today - and when applying approaches inspired by the phenomenology of the contemporary built environment, object-oriented ontology, and unseen lifeworlds - allows for a more meaningful treatment of Empson's criticism in its historical context, and when using scale as an heuristic to broaden our understandings of cosmologies, near and far, vastly different from our own.",10.1080/25723618.2017.1339506,0.0

Explicit semantic analysis (ESA) is a method that automatically extracts concept-based features from human knowledge repositories for semantic retrieval. This avoids the requirement of constructing and maintaining an explicitly formalized ontology. However, since domain-specific knowledge repositories are relatively small, the available terminologies are insufficient and concepts have coarse granularity. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ESA method for product model retrieval in construction industry. The major enhancements for the original ESA method consist of two parts. First, a novel concept expansion algorithm is proposed to solve the problem caused by insufficient terminologies. Second, a reranking algorithm is developed to solve the problem caused by coarse granularity of concepts.

The conversion from EXPRESS to OWL is of particular use to the architectural design and construction industry, because one of the key data models in this domain, namely the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), is represented using the EXPRESS information modelling language. These conversion efforts have by now resulted in a recommended ifcOWL ontology that stays semantically close to the EXPRESS schema. Two major improvements could be made in addition to this ifcOWL basis. First, the ontology could be split into diverse modules, making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology. Second, geometric aggregated data (e.g. lists of coordinates) could be serialised into alternative, less complex semantic structures. The purpose of both improvements is to make ifcOWL data smaller in size and complexity. In this article, we focus entirely on the second topic, namely the optimization of geometric data in the semantic representation. We outline and discuss the diverse available options in optimizing the data representations used. We quantify the impact of these measures on the ifcOWL ontology and instance model size.

There exist several cell classification ontologies with complementary information. However, one needs to merge them to synergistically combine their information. The main difficulty in merging is to match the ontologies since they use different naming conventions. Therefore, we developed an algorithm that merges ontologies by integrating the name matching between class label names with the structure mapping between the ontology elements based on graph convolution. Since the structure mapping is a time consuming process, we designed two methods to perform the graph convolution: vectorial structure matching and constraint-based structure matching. To perform the vectorial structure matching, we designed a general method to calculate the similarities between vectors of different lengths for different metrics. Additionally, we adapted the slower Blondel method to work for structure matching. We implemented our algorithms into FOntCell, a software module in Python for efficient automatic parallel-computed merging/fusion of ontologies in the same or similar knowledge domains. FOntCell can unify dispersed knowledge from one domain into a unique ontology in OWL format and iteratively reuse it to continuously adapt ontologies with new data endlessly produced by data-driven classification methods, such as of the Human Cell Atlas. To navigate easily across the merged ontologies, it generates HTML files with tabulated and graphic summaries, and interactive circular Directed Acyclic Graphs. We used FOntCell to merge the CELDA, LifeMap and LungMAP Human Anatomy cell ontologies into a comprehensive cell ontology.

In an attempt to do so, in 2011 the UK government made Building Information Modelling (BIM) level 2 a mandate for all public projects by 2016. Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is a project delivery approach closely attributed to BIM. However, it does not seem to have received proportionate level of attention and uptake in the UK. The research into reciprocal impacts of BIM and IPD are few and far between and non-existent in the UK construction context. This research investigates if and how IPD can facilitate BIM implementation in the UK. Capitalizing on relativist ontology, the study uses a mixed methodology to gauge industry experts' perception of the barriers to BIM implementation and uptake and the barriers to what constitutes IPD principles based on what has been found in the literature. The research findings support the hypothesis that IPD does help overcome barriers to collaboration, improve early involvement of the key participants and enhance the level of trust among key stakeholders; thereby helping eliminate the barriers to implementation of BIM. The research has also identified the main barriers to implementing IPD, which if overcome, could improve construction performance in terms of cost, time, efficiency and productivity in the UK by defragmenting parties through its multi-party agreement structure, facilitating BIM, enhancing parties' early involvement and collaboration through its inherent BIM contractual principles. The findings suggest that IPD can facilitate better and wider uptake of BIM in the UK construction industry.",10.1016/j.jobe.2019.100907,0.0

Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration.

For example, semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, are problems fundamentally created through the employment of representations to map the 'world' into models in an endeavour to anticipate different actors' views, vocabulary, and objectives. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work is the process of formalization and representation of document content, where most existing approaches are limited in their capability and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched by incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (the Semantic Associations) modelled by domain ontologies combined with the information presented in documents, thereby providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines.

Matching two data models effectively and efficiently is a challenging task, especially when performed manually, due to the large size and the complexity of today's data schemas. Some existing computer-aided approaches have attempted to automate matching of different schemas. These approaches work and reduce human effort under specific conditions; however, they do not always result in an accurate matching of two schemas. Achieving schema matching result comparable in accuracy to manual matching requires leveraging domain specific knowledge. Yet utilization of domain knowledge for schema matching rarely has been incorporated in prior studies. In this paper, we present a semiautomated approach that leverages domain knowledge to improve the schema matching process. Compared to a generic schema matching approach, the approach discussed in this paper is able to generate more accurate results due to the incorporation of domain specific constraints, which are represented and reasoned with to create a match between data models.

It spans a large spectrum of KM research published in the management, information systems, and information technology (IT) disciplines. An interpretive (subjectivist) stance is adopted so as to provide a holistic understanding and interpretation of organizational KM practice, research and models. Three generations of KM are identified and discussed. To sum up, to be effective organizations need not only to negotiate their migration from a knowledge sharing (first generation) to a knowledge nurturing (second generation) culture, but also to create sustained organizational and societal values. The latter form the third generation of KM and represent key challenges faced by modern organizations in the AEC industry. An evolutionary KM framework is provided that presents the three proposed generations of KM in terms of three dimensions that factor in (a) the capability of individuals, teams and organizations in the sector, (b) ICT evolution and adoption patterns, and (c) construction management philosophies.

More specifically, the evidence of behavioural and social/collective learning is investigated amongst hospital stakeholders during EWEs. The data gathered from a case study of a major hospital network of four hospitals were qualitatively analysed within a constructionist ontology and interpretivist epistemology using causal loop diagrams (CLDs). This revealed how lessons were learned in the hospital network from collective stakeholder EWEs' experiences. The findings highlight the need to develop appropriate processes and structures to capture, share and use facilities-related knowledge and embed new lessons learnt into future hospital disaster planning processes.

Accidents increase costs and construction time. Accordingly, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has relevant safety regulations for the construction industry. Integration of construction safety strategies into the design phase can prevent potential safety hazards. Most accidents occurring in this field are falling from the roof. Therefore, this paper has narrowed the scope of this study to falls from the roof and has developed the knowledge modeling based on the safety rules provided by OSHA. To apply safety rules at the design stage automatically, safety knowledge or information must first be understandable by the computers. In this study, the knowledge system was developed through ontology modeling using the ontology editing program Protege. The developed ontology model has two superclasses. These include information on building components based on the most widely used building information modeling program, and knowledge about roof-related safety rules provided by OSHA. The safety plan must include safety accidents and rules as well as their countermeasures associated with the components at the design stage. This paper is the first step to safety management at the design stage, which is the development of ontology modeling so that software can recognize and understand the construction safety knowledge and information. Beginning with this modeling, if there is a potential risk of violating rules related to construction safety requirements, all relevant safety controls are carried out at the design stage. In other words, the design will be completed, and the safety management plan will be finished before construction starts so that the accidents will be prevented during construction.",,

Holistic study of multiple energy-related behaviors is scarce. To fill the gap, this study investigated 22 government office buildings in Sichuan using questionnaires and field measurement. Environmental factors were ranked based on the two dimensions of importance level'level  and satisfaction level . The key energy-related behaviors were identified by the comparative study between low- and high-energy-consuming buildings. Lastly, interactions between the building energy consumption, indoor environment quality, occupants' satisfaction, and human behaviors were analyzed. Questionnaires reveal that most occupants consider indoor air quality as the prior pain point  while feeling satisfied enough with the thermal environment. Although people attach less importance to the acoustic environment, they manifest evident discontent, suggesting that noise control is an urgent imperative. In contrast, occupants are relatively unconcerned with illuminance, which implies the feasibility of saving energy by reasonably reducing lighting requirements of some non-critical areas. The comparative study indicates that increased energy consumption was attributable to extra personal appliances, wasteful air conditioning habits, and the lack of ventilation in summer. The objective environment of high-energy-consuming buildings is slightly better. However, the difference in perceived satisfaction was not obvious. The findings of this study contribute to determining the most noteworthy environmental factor and the key energy-related behaviors and provide reference information for optimizing energy-saving strategies.",10.3390/su131910607,0.0

For upcoming, new approaches to store building data, such as the Semantic Web, no universal common agreement exists on the combination of geometric and non-geometric data. It can therefore be unclear to users on how to represent their geometries, leading to a decelerated application and advancement of making building data available over the web. This gap can only be bridged if a common approach on the representation of geometries on the web is achieved. To first generate a common understanding of geometry representations, an overview of existing and developing geometry (web) standards needs to be given and discussed, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), CityGML, GeoSPARQL, and the OntoBREP and GEOM ontologies. This discussion needs to consider general contexts, e.g., 2D, 3D, detailed, or tessellated geometries, and specific use cases of the construction industry. Based on these discussions, this paper aims to propose a general recommendation for web-based geometry representations to enhance future applications of building data on the web. Due to the variety of use cases and their requirements, as well as technical constraints based on deviant interpretations of geometry descriptions from different geometry kernels, it became clear, that no approach or standard is generally superior to others. The biggest distinction identified in this paper is posed between the context of visualizing, where simplified, tessellated geometry holds the highest advantage, and (parametric) modeling, which requires semantically detailed geometry representations. Hence, we recommend to interlink non-geometric data with multiple geometry representations, to address all relevant contexts and use cases appropriately. The individual geometry representations should be chosen based on the relevant use cases for an optimal experience when using and exchanging geometry on the web. With this recommendation, the benefits of all discussed approaches can be exploited while avoiding their respective challenges.",10.1016/j.autcon.2018.12.026,0.0

There has been burgeoning research on the technical aspects of ZCBs. However, the aspect of stakeholder engagement, albeit imperative for zero carbon development, has been largely overlooked in the literature. This paper examines stakeholder knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) with regard to ZCBs in a systems manner, employing a new KAP model that integrates ontology, axiology and epistemology as the theoretical lens. The research was carried out through a questionnaire survey and focus group discussions with multiple stakeholders in the building industry in Hong Kong, which is a typical example of a high-density city. The results indicate the generally ambiguous and inconsistent knowledge, relatively negative attitude, and poor practice of stakeholders towards ZCBs. The statistical analysis findings reveal that differentiation exists between different stakeholder groups as to their knowledge, and this highlights the significant role that explicit ZCB knowledge plays in creating a knowledge-induced attitude that favours changes in practice leading to zero carbon developments. The applicability of the developed KAP model is verified using the case of Hong Kong, enabling the dialectics and complexities of stakeholder KAP towards ZCBs to be further clarified. Practical implications are provided to enhance the knowledge, shape the attitudes, and encourage the practices of building towards zero carbon in future cities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

146,"Zheng, Z; Zhou, YC; Lu, XZ; Lin, JR",Knowledge-informed semantic alignment and rule interpretation for automated compliance checking,Article,,"As an essential prodecure to improve design quality in the construction industry, automated rule checking (ARC) requires intelligent rule interpretation from regulatory texts and precise alignment of concepts from different sources. However, there still exists semantic gaps between design models and regulatory texts, hindering the exploitation of ARC. Thus, a knowledge-informed framework for improved ARC is proposed based on natural language processing. Within the framework, an ontology is first established to represent domain knowledge, including concepts, synonyms, relationships, constraints, etc. Then, semantic alignment and conflict resolution are introduced to enhance the rule interpretation process based on predefined domain knowledge and unsu-pervised learning techniques. Finally, an algorithm is developed to identify the proper SPARQL function for each rule, and then to generate SPARQL-based queries for model checking purposes, thereby making it possible to interpret complex rules where extra implicit data needs to be inferred. Experiments show that the proposed framework and methods successfully filled the semantic gaps between design models and regulatory texts with domain knowledge, which achieves a 90.1% accuracy and substantially outperforms the commonly used keyword matching method. In addition, the proposed rule interpretation method proves to be 5 times faster than the manual interpretation by domain experts. This research contributes to the body of knowledge of a novel framework and the corresponding methods to enhance automated rule checking with domain knowledge.",10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104524,0.0

By claiming ontological autonomy from external worlds, the virtual is liberated from the hegemonic control of the physical. To explore the opportunities that such disruption in the physical/virtual continuum offers, I reflect on a series of pedagogical experiments that challenge the myth of total virtuality-the idea that the ultimate virtual experience is total immersion. The persistent obsession to fully immerse the user in a supposedly unmediated interiority of the virtual is evident in the minimization of the virtual reality apparatus to a state of almost nothingness. In this paper, I introduce a series of alienation/defamiliarization strategies, through which designers can invoke awareness about the mediation involved in a virtual experience-a condition that I refer to as metavirtual. One strategy emphasizes the pixelated ontology of the virtual space by techniques of glitching, low-resolution, low-fidelity, and low-color bitmap renders. Another involves manipulating the phenomenological expectations that our perception often experiences in non-virtual environments. This includes, not only a reconceptualization of the spatial object but also revisiting the agency of the subject in the virtual world. Different modes of spatial experience through portals, flying, and teleportation, affect the subject's perception of space, and thereby alter their measurement of time.",10.1111/joid.12230,0.0

Design/methodology/approach This research generates contextual and holistic understandings of multiple project-level cases of BIM adoption through an interpretive paradigm guided by relativist ontology and subjectivist epistemology. Two models of project-level BIM adoption (ten-factor theory of BIM adoption and strategic-contingent model of BIM adoption) were merged to formulate the BIM adoption assessment scale (BIM-AAS). A qualitative-oriented case study protocol was developed to extract valid and reliable data from external and internal project data based on BIM-AAS features. The extracted data were analysed using the pattern-matching technique and cross-case analysis. Findings The results indicate that there was substantial use of BIM tools and technologies in the projects. All the projects adopted collaborative procurement and team and developed integrated building information models. The use of BIM tools, technologies and processes in the projects was found to be above average. The complexities and expectations levels of the projects compliment the nature of BIM adoption in the projects. Research limitations/implications The BIM-AAS adopted in this research is an excellent example of a project-level BIM adoption analytical tool. It can be assumed in future research. Also, this research contributes to the theory that the level of project complexity and expectations must align with the level of BIM adoption in projects. The study's findings ratify BIM tools, technologies and processes as the elements of project-level BIM adoption. Practical implications This research substantiates the actual nature and structure of BIM adoption in Nigeria, thereby simplifying the development of initiatives towards BIM adoption in projects and determining the appropriate strategies for BIM implementation and innovation in the Nigerian construction industry. The most important initiative that the Nigerian government can make to drive BIM implementation is the automating of code checking for building rules and regulations in Nigeria.

They usually take off the quantities of material and related work items and assign appropriate unit costs. In this case, unit cost assignment is solely at the engineer's professional discretion. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is widely adopted in the building construction industry. Tools can be used to automate material quantity, minimizing the time necessary for engineers to engage in the quantity measuring process. This function, however, does not provide any information on work items that are related to materials in the Bill of Quantity (BOQ). Thus, engineers still need to verify associated work items and assign unit costs. This research proposes an ontological inference of work item that enables an automated search of the most appropriate work items and their associated unit costs. This ontology contains semantic information for work items and work conditions, as well as a semantic reasoning rule that activates the ontology. A case study confirms that the proposed ontology and semantic reasoning rule can work in real-world situations. This paper contributes by eliminating subjective decision-making via search of appropriate work items for cost estimation and the use of BIM data extracted from IFCXML.

The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) paves the way to address this challenge but the heterogeneity of the represented knowledge about these artifact systems poses a real problem.

The main point with the ontologies is their structure and ability to serve for the intended purpose. This is only granted with the continuous evaluation of ontologies in the construction process, and also before release or reuse of the ontology. Ontology evaluation methods cluster around two concepts such as verification methods that ensure the structure of the ontology, and validation methods that examine their applicability in real world.

A variety of information is exchanged between these stakeholders during the different phases of the PSS lifecycle. Then, in order to manage the PSS, products and services need to be considered in a lifecycle perspective. To fulfill this requirement, an integrated information management associated with the physical product and non-physical related services provided throughout their lifecycle is essential. In this regard, it is necessary to know how to enhance Information System interoperability for PSS lifecycle management. To provide this functionality, ontology can be a good feature for defining a PSS semantic model. The aim of this paper is to use the advantages and features of ontologies in PSS models.

Cause and effect (CE) analysis is one of the tools and techniques for quality management, and is widely used in construction quality management practices for identifying all possible causes associated with a particular problem. CE analysis requires participation and brainstorming of domain experts and experienced practitioners; however, such a brainstorming session is usually time-consuming and cumbersome, making the CE analysis process inefficient. Therefore, an ontology-based representation model is proposed in this paper that can be applied to organize experts and practitioners' CE analysis knowledge as an ontology to benefit the reutilization of the knowledge. A case study is performed to demonstrate how the model works and can benefit the brainstorming session of a CE analysis process as well as the limitations of the model. Further studies on incorporating an automated reasoning mechanism into the model, including its implementation and advantages, are briefly discussed as well in this paper.",,

This archive is intended to pro-actively provide users with information to assist them in their daily business process handling. In this paper we describe the architecture of the OnToBau system. The system has four main parts. The preprocessing modules prepare the resources that should be stored in the knowledge archive for the enclosed inference system. The inference system is the core component and extracts the information from the preprocessed resources. Ontologies provide the necessary domain knowledge. In order to exploit the available knowledge, a personal agent monitors the current activities of the user and tries to infer the intention from his behaviors. At certain points it automatically offers the user helpful information. Again ontologies are used to represent information about the business processes. In addition, the user has the option to search for information in the archive through the graphical user interface. In this paper we focus on the description of the first main part of the architecture: to easily add knowledge to the knowledge base and to allow a general processing of different resources within a company (E-Mails, calendar entries, papers etc.), an XML-based representation language was developed, namely the OnToBau representation language (ORL).

Safety checking which identifies hazards before they occur is a core process of safety management on construction sites. However, the traditional construction safety checking which is operated by the experienced manager is manual and time-consuming. In order to integrate new technology into the construction safety checking system, a meta model for construction safety checking i.e. CSCOntology (Construction Safety Checking Ontology) has been developed in this paper. This model is formalized using an ontology language, OWL for encoding knowledge over the Web. Safety checking constraints which can extract from construction safety regulation provisions are represented with a rule language, SWRL. Then the construction safety checking processes are implemented in the JESS, a rule engine for the Java platform by transforming OWL knowledge into JESS facts, and SWRL constraints into JESS rules. A real-world example has been demonstrated in Protege 3.4 beta to show the proposed safety checking process, according to the regulation examples taken from 29 CFR 1926 OSHA Construction Industry Regulations.

This information is generally embedded into the BIM model as properties for parametric building objects, and is exchangeable among project stakeholders and BIM design programs a key feature of BIM for enhancing communication and work efficiency. However, BIM itself is a purpose-built, product-centric information database and lacks domain semantics such that extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information for the purpose of construction workface planning still remains a challenge. Moreover, some information crucial to construction practitioners, such as the topological relationships among building objects, remains implicit in the BIM design model. This restricts information extraction from the BIM model for downstream analyses in construction. To address identified limitations, this study proposes an ontology-based semantic approach to extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information from a BIM design model. This approach allows users to semantically query the BIM design model using a domain vocabulary, capitalizing on building product ontology formalized from construction perspectives. As such, quantity take-off information relevant to construction practitioners can be readily extracted and visualized in 3D in order to serve application needs in the construction field. A prototype application is implemented in Autodesk Revit to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new approach in the domain of light-frame building construction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Building information model (BIM) based workflows for historical buildings accumulate some of the data sets in a shared information model that contains the building's geometry assemblies with associated attributes (such as material). A BIM model of any building can be a source of data for different engineering assessments, for example, solar and wind exposure and seismic vulnerability, but for historic buildings it is particularly important for interventions like conservation, rehabilitation, and improvements such as refurbishment and retrofitting. When the BIM model is abstracted to a semantic model, enabling the use of semantic technologies such as reasoning and querying, semantic links can be established to other historical contexts. The semantic technologies help historic building experts to aggregate data into meaningful form. Ontologies provide them with an accurate knowledge representation of the concepts, relationships, and rules related to the historic building. In the paper, we are proposing an improved workflow for the transformation of a heritage BIM model to a semantic model. In the BIM part the workflow demonstrates how the fully parametric modelling of historical building components is relevant, for example, in terms of reusability and adaptation to a different context. In the semantic model part, ontology reuse, reasoning, and querying mechanisms are applied to validate the usability of the proposed workflow.

In this work, we aim to provide an initial approach to the question of how to model architectural data in a formal ontology structure and consider some of the problems involved. This question is challenging both for the inherent difficulties of the discourse to be modelled but also for the lack of available structured data sources that would distinctly represent the architectural perspective proper, as well as for the contentious nature of the definition of architecture itself. We, therefore, take the step of exploring in broad strokes the possible approaches to architecture, tracing the notion of architecture as idea, process or thing from the literature. On the basis of this enquiry, we propose a model of some top-level referents of architecture using FRBRoo, an extension of CIDOC CRM that can be used to model creative processes. We argue that with the addition of only four classes to this model, to capture certain architecturally specific concepts and activities, we are able to provide an adequate high-level first approach to this problem. Further, by connecting this work to the existing extension of CRMba, which models built work as a system of relations of filled and unfilled spaces, there is a sufficient high-level ontological structure to begin to test for its utility to explore the issues of the relation between architecture as idea, process and thing.",10.1007/s00799-016-0188-0,0.0

A suggested framework, based on engineering design theories of requirements management, was applied to a case study of the design of an energy-efficient building in a real construction project. The case study provided qualitative insights into how the proposed framework can contribute to a more structured requirements management of a construction project with a focus on the energy-efficient design of buildings. It can be seen that the proposed framework for requirements management of energy performance provides a structure for designers to consider and apply energy performance criteria in the early design stages and visualize the consequences of alternative design solutions for clients, engineers, contractors and suppliers. The use of a requirements structure enables the transparency of different design alternatives against the established functional requirements of energy performance for the stakeholders in the design process. The use of BIM to support the proposed requirements framework needs to be studied further and connected to national and international construction classification schemas and ontology frameworks.",,

While several methods to include geometry descriptions into a Semantic Web context exist, no uniform approach or general recommendation exists for the endeavour of describing building components in their entirety - including geometric descriptions -, leading to an increased suspension in applying Semantic Web Technologies in the construction domain. To therefore ease the description of geometric data in a Semantic Web context, we conduct an extensive literature review and analyse the identified, oftentimes isolated implementations for geometry descriptions in that context, with focus on requirements set by domain-specific use cases. Based on this analysis, we group the currently available implementations into approaches and compare them to offer means for deciding on which approach or implementation suits individual use cases. The identified approaches vary in their depth of the geometry descriptions integration into the Semantic Web and are subsequently studied regarding their overall aptness and characteristics in consideration of their application for future industry and research projects. In respect of the ongoing research in the field of the application of Semantic Web Technologies, not only in the construction domain, this article poses as an important foundation by giving a clear overview of existing implementations and relevant open research questions.

Many standards, databases, and tools have been developed for achieving a sustainable building. Not until recently have the importance of structural engineering and its contribution to sustainable building design been full recognised. However, due to the highly fragmented and diversity of knowledge across building and infrastructure domains, there is a lack of approach that can address all the sustainable issues within the structural design. This paper reviews the sustainable design from the perspective of structural engineering: (1) reviewing the current situation; (2) identifying the gaps and difficulties; and (3) making recommendations for future improvements. The strategies and indicators, as well as BIM-enabled methodology, for sustainable structural design (SSD) are also discussed in a holistic way. The results of this investigation show that most of the methods are not doing well in terms of delivering a successful sustainable structural design.

To reach this goal, it is necessary to use open standards for model exchange such as the Industry Foundation Classes ( IFC). The non-profit organization buildingSMART defines this standard. IFC provides object types and attributes, which describe properties of objects. The IFC standard do not address possible values for attributes; but beside coordinated names for object types and attributes, coordinated values for attributes are required. This is necessary for the evaluation of digital models for different purposes. Several approaches in the fields of ontology and classification systems address this issue. However, at present time there is no clear distinction between prerequisites that modeled objects have to fulfill and products, which satisfy these requirements. Suppliers or construction companies at the interface between planning and construction propose products for the modelled requirements of the planning process. This paper describes an approach that bases on a dictionary, which provides standardized object types, attributes and values. A project database and a database with products, called supplier database, use this dictionary as a basis. Resulting from the modeling phase, the project database is ultimately mapped with the supplier database to propose products that fulfill the requirements. The approach presented in this paper can be regarded as a next step in using a standard that already exists: the buildingSMART Data Dictionary.",10.1007/978-3-319-91638-5_17,0.0

Overall, 100 surveys were delivered in a 6-star building, rated according to the certification system Green Star, and in a non-rated building, from Western Sydney University. Occupants were inquired about their perception and interactions with heating, cooling, lighting, windows/doors opening, windows blinds and plug loads. This made possible to understand if there is a significant difference in energy-related occupant behaviour when comparing a green-rated to a non-green-rated building. Additionally, this study analysed if occupant's gender, age and work role, as well as the characteristics of the built environment have impact on occupant behaviours and actions. It was possible to conclude that the 'green' rating has no impact in the way occupants interact with the buildings' systems, and variables such as gender, age and the characteristics of the built environment have impact in the way occupants interact with the building features and systems.

Postindustrial landscapes are, by definition, functionally and materially obsolete, and in many cases derelict and decaying. While they hold historical significance, these sites are often not widely perceived as valuable contributors to our heritage. Yet these landscapes persist. We argue that the material persistence of these features is the result of generally unrecognized processes of informal material conservation. In this paper, we outline a new framework, vernacular preservation, an ontology for heritage professionals to use in considering how to approach and recognize nonformal interventions that result in the protection of heritage resources. Here, we use the postindustrial landscape of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula-a former copper-mining district-to illustrate how vernacular preservation differs from formal historic preservation, reviewing the process of vernacular preservation and how it is activated in practice. Vernacular preservation constitutes perhaps the most traditional, common, and widespread mechanism of material conservation of the historical built environment yet has been largely invisible, little discussed, and undertheorized by the heritage preservation community. Understanding this preservation process begins by acknowledging its existence and by extending the heritage dialogue to include these underrepresented historical properties and their important role in defining postindustrial landscapes. We conclude the paper with a discussion on how this novel approach to thinking about preservation extends broadly to the field and should be given greater attention.",10.1353/cot.2017.0006,0.0

To manage knowledge effectively, various information technology (IT) models and systems have been developed for knowledge management (KM) in the construction industry over the years. As the next generation of IT application in construction, building information modeling (BIM) is increasingly used today to aid KM. Compared to generic IT tools, BIM has some distinctive features, such as parametric modeling, virtual visualization and centralized platform. However, how to apply these features of BIM to better serve KM has not yet been well summarized and analyzed. In this research, 115 papers on IT-based KM and 73 papers on BIM-supported KM are reviewed, based on which an integrated framework is developed to describe the current status and future directions for KM in IT-generic and BIM-specific contexts. It is followed by a conceptual model of BIM-supported KM which shows the possible KM factors and their relationships in the BIM environment. This research highlights the transformation from IT-based KM into BIM-supported KM. It contributes to the identification of remaining challenges to BIM-supported KM and the elaboration of BIM-supported KM in construction research and practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In comparison to green-field construction projects, adaptive reuse projects require distinct stages, definition of interfaces, decision gates, and planning methods in order to secure the success of the building project. Unfortunately, little research has been done regarding establishing feasible systems for the planning, assessment, and management of adaptive reuse projects, leading to underperforming building projects outcomes. Interface management (IM) can improve renovation projects outcomes by defining appropriate ways to identify, record, monitor, and track project interfaces. IM has the potential of bringing cost and time benefits during adaptive reuse projects execution. The aim of this study is to develop a reference framework for implementing IM for adaptive reuse projects. First, the inefficiencies of redevelopment projects are explained inside of a circular economy (CE) context. Second, an ontology of IM for adaptive reuse projects is defined based on the current barriers to adaptive reuse and the most common interface problems in construction projects. Third, the defined ontology is expanded through a case study by showing examples of adaptive reuse barriers on a case project, and how IM could have been part of the solution for these problems. Finally, this study concludes with the suggestions on interface management systems (IMS) implementation for future adaptive reuse projects.",10.3390/buildings9050105,0.0

Even though some technological innovations around Building Information Modeling (BIM) might have the potential to overcome these challenges, data integration across disciplines, companies and software solutions is yet to be solved entirely. Trending advancements try to enrich existing BIM data using Linked Data technologies to semantically describe the building information and facilitate data integration. By that, project data from different data sources is made available in an accessible format, so project participants can use it for their planning efforts. In this paper we explore the use of Linked Building Data (LBD) on a specific use case to answer the question of how the planning of Temporary Construction Items (TCIs) can be improved by integrating data and automating the demand calculation. A literature review concludes that TCIs only experience little attention in the current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the outcome of a project. Thus, the objective of this paper is to develop standard ontologies to provide a semantically rich terminology of the data and to propose a framework for TCI consideration within a BIM based project delivery system. A prototype solution is developed, taking formwork as a TCI representative. The result is a process for automatically creating a TCI utilization plan that quantifies the precise time- and location-based on-site TCI demand by integrating data from BIM, Location-Based Scheduling (LBS) and TCI information. Based on the results of prototyping and findings from expert interviews, this research integrates the solution into the process of construction and finally proposes two implementation scenarios for the solution - one being based on the current industry situation and one exploring the future vision of a more integrated and decentralized project delivery in the construction industry.",10.1016/j.autcon.2022.104258,0.0

Twenty-two in-depth interviews form the primary evidence of the case studies. The methodology incorporates network analysis of concepts that influence energy use to formalize the case studies and collect additional knowledge. The framework comprises thirteen construction activities and twenty-one systems and factors related to design, resources and site characteristics, specific to the construction domain. This set of concepts can influence the energy consumption during the construction phase. Although these concepts are present in nearly every project, their dynamics and their inter-relations with project-specific systems change, depending on the context of the project. The proposed method, which employs network analysis, help identify their interrelationships and relative importance of these concepts. In addition to the opportunities and lessons learned that can guide future energy assessments and improve energy use in construction projects, the results show how promising network analytics is to obtain knowledge usually difficult to perceive in traditional knowledge processes. Besides, this work highlights the importance of supporting collaboration between project team members to study and decide on the plans to manage/reduce energy consumption during the construction phase in oil and gas facilities. While the energy savings are smaller than the upstream and operation phases, it has received much less attention. It is also a phase with much more subjective and contextualized knowledge making the use of case-based analyses more suitable. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of Job Hazard Analysis is commonly used to mitigate and control these occupational hazards. This technique analyzes the major tasks in a construction activity, identifies all potential task-related hazards, and suggests safe approaches to reduce or avoid each of these hazards. In this paper, the authors explore the possibility of leveraging existing construction safety resources to assist JHA, aiming to reduce the level of human effort required. Specifically, the authors apply ontology-based text classification (TC) to match safe approaches identified in existing resources with unsafe scenarios. These safe approaches can serve as initial references and enrich the solution space when performing JHA. Various document modification strategies are applied to existing resources in order to achieve superior TC effectiveness. The end result of this research is a construction safety domain ontology and its underlying knowledge base. A user scenario is also discussed to demonstrate how the ontology supports JHA in practice.

The main novelties are the introduction of a set of specific dependency patterns and the introduction of a partially revised TRIZ (Russian acronym for T spacing diaeresis heory of Inventive Problem Solving) spacing diaeresis ontology to classify the retrieved information. The proposed dependency patterns were manually extracted from a sample patents pool about waste recycling and reuse. The classification of the information is based on different classes: (1) what transformations can be carried out on the waste, (2) what technologies can be used to carry out these transformations, (3) what products can be obtained by transforming the waste, (4) what functions can be carried out by the waste, (5) with which technologies, and (6) on which entities. An automatic implementation of the proposed method, involving the manual check of the retrieved results, was tested through a case study about wood chip recycling and reuse. Compared to the dependency patterns from the literature, the proposed ones allowed to retrieve 28 % more pertinent information. This results mainly depends by better ability of the proposed patterns to better discriminate the relevant sentences from which to extract information, compared to the other patterns (i.e. + 40 %). The automatic classification of the information was also correctly performed: in almost each class, precision and recall were higher than 60 % and on average equal to 90 %. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.
