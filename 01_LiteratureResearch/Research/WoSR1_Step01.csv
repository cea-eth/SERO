14,J,"Dunant, CF; Skelton, ACH; Drewniok, MP; Cullen, JM; Allwood, JM",A marginal abatement cost curve for material efficiency accounting for uncertainty,Article,MACC; Material efficiency; Policy guidance,STEEL; REUSE,"Comparing costs of measures to mitigate greenhouse gas is challenging as there are many competing notions of costs, and uncertainties associated with cost estimates. In addition, there are many different types of mitigation measures, from supply-side investment solutions to demand-side efficiency improvements, which may interact, risking double-counting of abatement potentials. This paper presents a novel, transparent methodology for building a marginal abatement cost curve that allows abatement costs and potentials to be compared. This curve improves over existing methods as it allows for abatement measures to be pursued in parallel, takes into account the interplay between abatement measures and captures data on cost uncertainty. The method is applied to build the first bottom-up marginal abatement cost curve for greater material efficiency steel use in the UK. This curve is demonstrated via four material efficiency measures which do not require large changes in final uses of products: reusing steel beams in construction, specifying optimal lightweight beams in construction, choosing smaller cars and specifying high strength steel car bodies. The results show that these strategies could reduce UK steel demand and associated global emissions by approximately 12%. 17% of this potential would be viable at the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) 2030 carbon price for policy appraisal (79 pound/ t CO2) taking into account emissions savings associated with steel demand only. Once use-phase emissions savings are taken into account this share increases to 60%. These results can be traced directly back to underlying assumptions regarding costs and emissions allocations.",MAY,2019.0,10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.01.020,0.0

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables. Therefore, the authors suggest utilizing the approach developed in this research to promote the circularity of materials in different subsectors of the construction industry.

Efficient material use through optimised cross-section design reduces construction material demand. Demountable steel-concrete composite floor systems are perceived as competitive when consisting of steel beams and large prefabricated concrete floor elements, with composite interaction achieved by demountable shear connectors. Compared to traditional monolithic floor systems, the demountable composite floor systems have an increased sensitivity to lateral-torsional buckling during execution, mostly because of unsymmetrical loading and the absence of rotational constraints in the execution phase. This increased sensitivity implies that the cross-section of the steel beam should not only be designed based on the required in-plane resistance, but should also maximise the out-of-plane resistance. The Energy method and Rayleigh-Ritz methods are combined to develop a prediction model for the critical bending moment of monosymmetrical web-tapered steel beams. The key cross-sectional dimensions and parameters that affect the in-plane and out-of-plane resistance are identified. An overarching strategy for the concurrent optimisation of the in-plane and out-of-plane resistance of monosymmetrical cross-sections is presented without compromising on material efficiency. The beneficial effects of the proposed optimisation strategy are quantified through a case study example.",APR,2020.0,10.1016/j.istruc.2020.01.049,0.0

It is shown by the neutron activation analysis that a relatively short-lived Ar-41 (T-1/2=1.85 h), Ar-37 (T-1/2=35 days) and rather long lived Ar-39 (T-1/2=269 yr) may appear in these materials under the fusion neutron irradiation conditions. While argon production is essentially less than helium production in irradiated materials, at other times its impact, e.g., in the inhalation dose, becomes significant. In some cases the Ar-39 activity is comparable or even exceeds the C-14 activity and may become apparent after tritium removal from plasma exhaust and dust, from the liquid breeders, during plasma-facing and structural component recycling and waste management. The main source terms of argon-39 activity for these materials are identified and the specific production rates are evaluated relative to radiation conditions of a power or DEMO fusion reactor and to electric power production.

First an outline of the software in question, the development environments, and approaches to automation is given. With respect to the major automation methods, the structure of methods for categorized reusable components, a structural element, and the design of skeletons for batch programming are described. This approach uses (1) input and output component groups, (2) program skeleton groups, and (3) data processing groups for which detailed processes have been turned into components, all in a mutually independent fashion as categorized reusable components for the software to be generated. Then these components are adjusted and a program is generated by combining them together using tools. By making the components independent in this fashion, this approach has the capacity to create X*Y*Z structures overall even with only X, Y, and Z components each.

Specifically, the distance between planning and execution brings cost overruns and duration extensions. To minimize variations, this research presents a Building Information Modeling (BIM)-integrated simulation framework for predicting productivity dynamics at the construction planning phase. To develop this framework, we examined critical factors affecting productivity at the operational level, and then forecast the productivity dynamics. The resulting plan includes specific commands for retrieving the required information from BIM and executing operation simulations. It consists of the following steps: (1) preparing a BIM model to produce input data; (2) composing a construction simulation at the operational level; and (3) obtaining productivity dynamics from the BIM-integrated simulation. To validate our framework, we applied it to a structural steel model; this was due to the significance of steel erections. By integrating BIM with construction operation simulations, we were able to create reliable construction plans that adapted to project changes. Our results show that the developed framework facilitates the reliable prediction of productivity dynamics, and can contribute to improved schedule reliability, optimized resource allocation, cost savings associated with buffers, and reduced material waste.",NOV,2016.0,10.3390/su8111106,0.0

This was the case in the design of a new art gallery constructed within the footprint of an existing 1930s apartment building for which Thornton Tomasetti (TT) performed structural engineering services. Zoning restrictions necessitated preservation of the existing exterior masonry walls. A steel skeleton was constructed within the building for bracing before removing the existing floors, and the steel was repurposed in the final composite steel/concrete frame system. Fully encased composite steel beams and columns, and concrete pan joists, were deemed best suited for the high design loads (as much as 300 psf), staged construction, and minimal structural floor depths. Thermally broken connections between the new interior framing and existing walls were required by the owner to optimize building performance. Additional structural innovations included the implementation of push piles to support the existing wall, the excavation of a new basement four feet beneath the existing foundations, a 10-foot thermally broken cantilever at the roof level, and the conversion of a portion of the building into a 40-foot high atrium. This paper will explore creative solutions and successful collaboration in demonstrating a successful model for combining structural system reuse, high performance structural design and detailing, and avant-garde architecture in one building.",,2015.0,,

The demountable Hollo-bolts are utilised to facilitate the quick installation and dismantling for replacement and reuse. In the developed model, material and geometric nonlinearities were included. The accuracy of the developed model was assessed by comparing the numerical results with previous experimental tests on hollow/composite column-to-steel beam joints that incorporated endplates and Hollo-bolts. In particular, the Hollo-bolts were modelled with the expanded sleeves involved, and different material properties of the Hollo-bolt shank and sleeves were considered based on the information provided by the manufacture. The developed models, therefore, can be applied in the present study to simulate the wall-to-beam joints with similar structural components and characteristics. Based on the validated model, the authors herein compared the behaviour of wall-to-beam joints of two commonly utilised composite walling systems (Case 1: flat steel plates with headed studs; Case 2: lipped channel section with partition plates). Considering the ease of manufacturing, onsite erection and the pertinent costs, composite walling system with flat steel plates and conventional headed studs (Case 1) was the focus of present study. Specifically, additional headed studs were pre-welded inside the front wall plates to enhance the joint performance. On this basis, a series of parametric studies were conducted to assess the influences of five design parameters on the behaviour of bolted endplate wall-to-beam joints. The initial stiffness, plastic moment capacity, as well as the rotational capacity of the composite wall-to-beam joints based on the numerical analysis were further compared with the current design provision.",JUL 10,2022.0,10.12989/scs.2022.44.1.033,0.0

Much of the environmental impact of buildings is associated with consumption of resources and generation of waste, therefore reducing waste in construction is becoming a top priority for all the European Governments. Composite structures formed by connecting the concrete slabs to the supporting steel beams have been widely used for many years throughout the world, this cost-effective arrangement for floor system in multi-storey steel frame building structures is responsible for a considerable increase in the load-bearing capacity and stiffness of the steel beams, which has resulted in significant savings in steel weight and construction cost. However, shear connectors are welded through the steel decking and cast into the concrete; this made deconstruction and reuse of the steel components almost impossible. A demountable shear connector is developed to assess its potential and suitability in term of replacing the welded through headed shear studs. Test results shown that these shear connectors can be easily demounted both at working and ultimate load and have a similar capacity to the traditional welded shear connectors. In addition, the new demountable shear connectors process high ductility in comparison with the welded shear connectors and have similar behaviour to the traditional welded headed stud shear connectors. A fnite element is developed to carry out parametric study for this form of shear connector.",,2016.0,,

Columns are built up of H-SA700 plates using bolts only, and bolted connections are adopted extensively for easier replacement or reuse of structural components. An analytical study is performed to predict three distinctive local buckling modes of the column and estimate its elastic flexural stiffness, yield strength, and maximum strength subjected to combined flexure and compression. Cyclic loading behavior of the column is examined through five half-scale specimens, which vary with axial force, bolt pitch, and loading direction (about major or minor axis). The columns achieve a very large elastic rotation, approximately 0.02 rad at the axial force ratio of 0.2, and a maximum bending strength surpassing the plastic moment of the reduced section accounting for bolt holes without fracture.

In order to inform current design practices and provide information to partially evaluate if a steel member can be reused after its service life, construction-induced strains in a typical building were recorded. Specifically, two columns and three Beams of a four-story steel-framed building were instrumented prior to delivery to the construction site using a wireless sensor network. Data were recorded for 48 days, while the structure was erected and the concrete deck poured, up to fireproofing the building. The data were analyzed considering dead load force effects during various construction phases, impacts, and temperatures. The analysis revealed high variations in temperature throughout the structure and consequently significant temperature-induced stresses as well as greater magnitudes of flexural stress in columns than expected. As a result, the recorded stresses differed by 1-120 MPa (0-18 ksi) compared to the theoretically predicted stresses. Yet, the maximum measured stress [160 MPa (23.2 ksi)] was only 46% of the nominal yield strength. Measured stresses were also used to calculate member forces, and the combined member forces resulted in a maximum of 55% of the yield limit.

The cost of construction of such frames can be reduced by providing additional structural steel members, called bracings, between suitable pairs of nodes of the building. The patterns generated from a CA-LFSR, tuned to the structural configuration of a building, dictates the desired positions of bracings resulting in a structure with reduced construction cost. The cost optimal design developed around the CA-LFSR is reached in constant time that is possible with the conventional design procedure based on the principles of structural engineering.

Because these systems use steel headed stud anchors welded onto steel flanges and encased in cast-in-place concrete slabs to achieve composite action, it is not possible to readily deconstruct and reuse the steel beams and concrete slabs. As the building industry is moving towards sustainability, there are clear needs for developing sustainable steel-concrete composite floor systems to facilitate material reuse, minimize consumption of raw materials, and reduce end-of-life building waste. This paper presents the behavior and design strategies for a sustainable steel-concrete composite floor system. In this system, deconstructable clamping connectors are utilized to attach precast concrete planks to steel beams to achieve composite action. The load-slip behavior of the clamping connectors was studied in pushout tests, and the test results showed that the clamping connectors possess similar shear strength to 19 mm diameter shear studs and much greater slip capacity. Four full-scale beam tests were performed to investigate the flexural behavior of the deconstructable composite beams under gravity loading and validate the connector behavior attained from the pushout tests. All the beams behaved in a ductile manner. The flexural strengths of the composite beam specimens closely match the strengths predicted for composite beams by the design provisions of the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC).",,2018.0,10.4995/ASCCS2018.2018.7060,0.0

However, despite the environmental benefits involved, additional costs and increased design difficulty limit the application of reuse. This paper proposes an optimal design method that minimizes the CO2 emissions and costs of the noise barrier tunnel. In the proposed method, information on reusable steel beams from the building information modeling data of the noise barrier tunnel is extracted, and the optimization problem is defined. In addition, designs and component procurement plans aiming to minimize CO2 emissions and costs are derived using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The results of the case study show that depending on the situation, CO2 emissions are reduced from 1% to 92% and costs are reduced by up to 25% relative to the case without reuse. As in previous studies, CO2 emission could be reduced herein through reuse, but an increase in costs was observed in some cases. This study contributes to the literature by providing optimal alternatives for designers through an optimal design method integrating strategies to overcome barriers to the practice of reuse. The case study results also highlight the need for an assessment through the entire life cycle, including the modification and in-spection processes of reusable components that are generally excluded.

Nevertheless, reuse is not a widespread practice in the steel industry, which owes most of its environmental credentials to an extensive and self-sustaining recycling infrastructure. This suggests that there exist economic, technical or institutional obstacles that limit the extent to which reuse of steel products is feasible and profitable. In this paper we examine the obstacles that constrain the reuse of steel construction products and suggest possible ways to overcome them. An analytical model is developed to illustrate and compare the differences between recycling and reuse in supply loop systems. Our modelling approach allows us to derive some general results about the economic and environmental performance of both recovery options.

An efficient response from the building sector requires research aimed at the minimisation of the environmental impact of buildings throughout their life cycle, from construction to demolition. The end of a building's service life can critically influence the total environmental impact, particularly with building technologies such as steel construction. The purpose of the current research was the assessment of the environmental impact caused by different end-of-life scenarios as can be applied to steel buildings. An existing residential steel building is used for the calculations, while the results allow for the comparison between the different end scenarios concerning the main structural materials used, namely the structural steel. Conclusions drawn include the formation of a clear perspective on the environmental impact benefits that can be achieved at the end of a steel building's life cycle and the positive effects of the steel construction technology as applied to building projects in terms of environmental sustainability.

To reduce substantially material consumption and waste caused by the construction industry, structures can be designed and built with reused elements. Structural element reuse involves: element sourcing and deconstruction, reconditioning and transport. As these processes also generate environmental impacts, reuse might not always be preferred over new construction. This paper presents a method to design reticular structures with minimal environmental impact made from reused and new elements. The formulation given in this paper is based on a combination of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and discrete structural optimization. The LCA carried out in this work accounts for impacts generated from sourcing reclaimed elements to the assembly of the structure. Structural optimization is subject to stress constraints on element capacity and deflection limits for serviceability. Typical loading scenarios are considered. The method is applied to the design of three single-span steel trusses of different topology subject to 100 simulated stocks of reusable elements that have varying cross-sections and lengths. Benchmarks against minimum-weight solutions made solely from recycled steel show that this method produces structures with up to 56% lower environmental impact. Depending on stock availability, the lowest environmental impact is achieved through a combination of reused and new elements. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

It is inevitable that the smelting process during steel recycling operations is expensive and consumes a tremendous amount of energy. Therefore, hypothetically, direct reuse of steel materials without smelting can be environmentally and economically advantageous over recycling. In this article, an innovative recovering path for size-specific sheet metal scrap from the automobile industry is being proposed. The idea is to directly use the sizable sheet metal scrap generated from the car-body manufacturing process in the automobile industry to design and fabricate new metal facade systems for buildings' exteriors. An empirical case study was conducted, which is being presented to illustrate the benefits of reusing steel scrap over recycling with the same material using quantitative analysis. The required capital cost and energy consumption of generating a building metal facade system were evaluated. The results showed that reusing the sheet metal scrap over conventional recycling of the same material would lead to a cost reduction of approximately 40% (400 $/ton) and savings of approximately 67% (10 MJ/kg) of energy consumption. The tested concept promotes an innovative industrial symbiosis between the auto industry and the building and construction industry through creating a secondary closed supply-chain loop to achieve both circular economy and energy savings through adding value by design.

Previous research has shown that, at room temperature, the mechanical performance of the U-shaped steel beams filled with DCLs and FC is similar to that of the U-shaped steel beams filled with FC alone. This research explores the fire behavior of the U-shaped steel beams filled with DCLs and FC. Five specimens including three beams filled with DCLs and FC and two reference beams filled with FC alone were tested in fire. The experimental parameters included the replacement ratio of DCLs, the longitudinal reinforcement ratio, the load ratio, and the thickness of fire insulation. Based on the test results, numerical models in which the thermal resistance at the interface between the U-shaped steel and the in-filled concrete is considered are developed using SAFIR to determine the thermal and structural responses of the specimens. Lastly, parametric studies are carried out preliminarily to investigate the effects of some parameters on the fire resistance of such beams. It is found that the replacement ratio of DCLs within a range of 0% to 33% has a very limited effect on the temperature distribution, structural response, and fire resistance of the specimens, that embedding longitudinal reinforcements can significantly increase the fire resistance of such beams, that the interface thermal resistance can generate a temperature drop of up to 280 degrees C at the interface between the U-shaped steel and the in-filled concrete, and that the numerical models are capable of predicting the thermal and structural responses of such beams.",AUG,2018.0,10.3390/app8081361,0.0

However, because the headed stud shear connectors are welded onto the top flange of the steel beam and cast into the in situ concrete slab, deconstruction of the composite beam and the reuse of its components at the end of structural life in defence to demolition is virtually impossible, which is at odds with the increasing demands placed on improving the sustainability of building infrastructure. As an alternative, an innovative sustainable composite beam and slab system is proposed, in which precast geopolymer concrete panels are attached to the steel beams using high-strength friction-grip bolts instead of cast in situ floors with pre-welded headed stud connectors. The advantages of a low-carbon design, both by the use of geopolymer concrete elements and system deconstructability, can be achieved in this proposed system. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model is developed to investigate the structural behaviour of the proposed sustainable composite beam and slab system. Material non-liriearities and the interaction of the structural components are included in the model. The accuracy and reliability of the finite element formulation developed are validated by comparisons with experimental results. Extensive parametric studies are conducted to elucidate the effects of the change in the concrete panel configuration, the number and diameter of the bolts, the type and strength of the concrete and the grade of the steel beam on the behaviour of the system.

In this study, we propose a framework for designing structures using reusable steel beams. The design framework consists of a material bank and a design support tool. The material bank provides information on reusable materials based on the building information modeling. The design support tool generates efficient material procurement plans and provides information about the environmental and economic impact of the project. In a case study used to verify the framework, CO2 emissions were reduced by up to 77% through material reuse, which was consistent with the results of previous studies.

The construction systems considered are reinforced concrete framing (RC), structural steel framing (SS) and cold-formed steel framing (CFS). The framework is developed in accordance with the relevant guidelines for life cycle analysis and sustainability and is intended to support decision making in the design stage. The system boundary for the study is from cradle-to-grave, including all cost components from construction stage, use stage and disposal stage in addition to possible recycling/reuse options. The developed framework integrates building information modeling, energy simulation modeling and end of life scenarios to calculate and compare life cycle costs and sustainability advantages of construction system alternatives. All future costs are discounted to their present value using the appropriate interest rates. Uncertainties in the input parameters are modeled using realistic probability distributions and then used in a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of changes in the input parameters on the result. Application of the developed system to a university building revealed the following results. The total life cycle cost is nearly the same for RC framing system and CFS framing system, while the life cycle cost of SS framing system is 13.4% more. When the system is credited for possible revenues resulting from early operation and recycling/reuse, the total life cycle cost of the RC framing system and the SS framing system become nearly the same while the life cycle cost of the CFS framing system becomes 22% less. Sensitivity analysis of the results shows that the discount rate has the most effect on the estimated mean cost followed by the inflation rate and the construction cost. The sustainability assessment focuses on calculating the LEED points associated with material recycling/reuse potentials and waste management. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, it is difficult to reclaim components from demolition, and materials remain cheap compared with labour, so new approaches are needed for reuse to be implemented beyond niche projects. This study therefore reviews waste interventions. Multiple case studies, spanning new builds and refurbishment, were undertaken to examine systemic mechanisms that lead to components being discarded. Evidence from fieldwork observations, waste documentation, and interviews indicates that the generators of unwanted components effectively decide their fate, and a failure to identify components in advance, uncertainty over usefulness, the perception of cost and programme risk in reclamation, and the preferential order of the waste hierarchy mean that the decision to discard to waste management goes unchallenged. A triage process is proposed to capture timely information about existing building components to be discarded, make this information visible to a wide community, and determine usefulness by focusing creativity already present in the industry on an exhaustive examination of component reusability and upcyclability.",JAN,2018.0,10.3390/su10010229,0.0

The residual capacity has been probabilistically evaluated in order to check the efficiency of the most vulnerable members of the structures and investigate systems' robustness in case of sudden failure of the critical components.

As a new structural steel, the post-fire mechanical properties, regarded as a crucial indicator to assess structural damage and reusability after fire, need to be studied. Hence, a comprehensive experimental investigation on the influence of two artificial cooling methods on post-fire mechanical properties of Q355 steel is reported in this study. The specimens were first heated to target temperatures of 200 degrees C, 400 degrees C, 500 degrees C, 600 degrees C, 700 degrees C, 800 degrees C and 900 degrees C to simulate various fire conditions and then cooled by fire-extinguishing foam cooling and water cooling. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed on these fire-affected specimens to extract the stress-strain curves and associated post-fire mechanical properties. Additionally, fracture behavior of Q355 steel cooled by the two artificial cooling methods was also discussed from macroscopic and microscopic fracture morphology. For the two artificial cooling methods, it is explicitly found that the loss of mechanical properties of Q355 steel is negligible after exposure to temperatures below 600 degrees C. However, both cooling methods and elevated temperatures have significant effects on post-fire mechanical properties of Q355 steel after the exposure temperature exceeds 600 degrees C. In case of fire-extinguishing foam cooling, a dramatic decrease in yield strength and ultimate strength is observed, while the ductility is gradually increased with increasing temperature. In contrast, a sharp increase in yield strength and ultimate strength can be observed clearly, while the ductility is sharply reduced with increasing temperature. After exposure to the temperature of 900 degrees C, Q355 steel cooled by fire-extinguishing foam is able to retain 79% of its original ultimate strength, while Q355 steel cooled by water is able to gain 131% of its original ultimate strength in the as-received state. At last, new equations are developed to predict post-fire mechanical properties of Q355 steel for fire damage evaluation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This is especially true when structural elements require a specific and restricted habitat, or if the construction of nests is costly in time and energy. The availability of nesting-platforms is influenced by nest creation and persistence. In a Mediterranean forest in southeastern Spain, nesting-platforms are the only structural element for three forest-dwelling raptor species: booted eagle Aquila pennata, common buzzard Buteo buteo and northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis. From 1998 to 2013, we tracked the fate of 157 nesting-platforms built and reused by these species with the aim of determining the rates of creation and destruction of nesting-platforms, estimating nest persistence by applying two survival analyses, describing the pattern of nest reuse and testing the effects of nest use on breeding success. Nest creation and destruction rates were low (0.14 and 0.05, respectively). Using Kaplan Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional-hazards regression models we found that median nest longevity was 12 years and that this was not significantly affected by nest characteristics, nest-tree dimensions, nest-builder species, or frequency of use of the platform. We also estimated a transition matrix, considering the different stages of nest occupation (vacant or occupied by one of the focal species), to obtain the fundamental matrix and the average life expectancies of nests, which varied from 17.9 to 19.7 years. Eighty six percent of nests were used in at least one breeding attempt, 67.5% were reused and 17.8% were successively occupied by at least two of the study species. The frequency of nest use had no significant effects on the breeding success of any species.

This paper addresses the approach of the reuse of steel structure without melting which allows for savings in steel mass and the reduction of waste amounts offering moreover an opportunity to avoid environmental burdens related to the recycling process. Recent studies have stressed the technical feasibility of this strategy, which appears particularly effective in those countries in which a building's life is rather short, such as in Japan and US, though its application encounters more difficulties in most European countries, owing to longer building use. Besides stressing the architectural and structural feasibility of the above-mentioned strategy, this research work aims to quantify the mass savings that are achievable in this manner by presenting a real case study set in Italy. It consists in a railway station, which has been designed keeping in mind the partial employment of structural elements recovered from an old industrial building that is no longer in use. To estimate the amount of steel saved, two different structural models for the designed building have been carried out and compared. In the first one, the structure has been designed on the assumption of the reusing of recovered structural elements; in the second one, the same structure has been designed considering the use of new elements only. The final result of the analysis shows that steel reuse allowed for savings of up to 30% of steel. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",MAY,2014.0,10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.02.011,0.0

To provide large-scale reuse, the components of a SPL should be easy to maintain. Therefore, developers have to identify anomalous code structures - i.e., code anomalies -that are detrimental to the SPL maintainability. Otherwise, SPL changes can eventually propagate to seemly-unrelated features and affect various SPL products. Previous work often assume that each code anomaly alone suffices to characterize SPL maintenance problems, though each single anomaly may represent only a partial, insignificant, or even inexistent view of the problem. As a result, previous studies have difficulties in characterizing anomalous structures that indicate SPL maintenance problems. In this paper, we study the surrounding context of each anomaly and observe that certain anomalies may be interconnected, thereby forming so-called anomaly agglomerations. We characterize three types of agglomerations in SPL: feature, feature hierarchy, and component agglomeration. Two or more anomalies form an agglomeration when they affect the same SPL structural element, i.e. a feature, a feature hierarchy, or a component. We then investigate to what extent non-agglomerated and agglomerated anomalies represent sources of a specific SPL maintenance problem: instability. We analyze various releases of four feature-oriented SPLs.

Moreover, significant advances have been made for predicting the response of steel members, connections, and structural systems exposed to fire. Nevertheless, the research on the reuse of steel structures after a fire event is limited. A steel structure designed according to the current seismic codes can survive a fire without significant structural damage and may be repaired and reused. Therefore, it is of great importance to study whether the reuse of steel structures after a fire is safe in high seismicity areas. This paper investigates the seismic performance of steel columns that are pre-damaged due to fire. For this purpose, sophisticated finite element models have been developed and validated against experimental data. It was concluded that the models accurately predict the behaviour of beams-columns at elevated temperatures. First, the behaviour of the columns was studied using simplified boundary conditions; the surrounding structure was not included in the numerical model. Thermal-structural analyses were performed to determine the structural damage induced by the fire. Subsequently, the cyclic performance of the columns was investigated, considering both the residual post-fire deformations and the proper material properties. Aiming to obtain more realistic results, the complicated interaction between the heated columns and the surrounding structure was considered in the modelling. For this reason, the fire behaviour of a seismic resistant frame was simulated. Then, the behaviour of fire-damaged columns under cyclic loading was assessed.

A detailed analysis of the costs and risks of reuse in practice in the UK is lacking. We found that although there is a sufficient spread between the price of steel scrap and new steel, this difference cannot be captured by the demolition contractors. Rather, reused steel is somewhat more expensive than new elements, except in certain circumstances such as when the reused elements are available from a nearby site, or when testing elements can be avoided. Further, we show that neither the costs of steel reuse, nor the risks, nor its benefits are spread equitably throughout the construction industry supply chain: most of the substantial and capital-intensive changes required for the widespread adoption of steel reuse are concentrated on steelwork contractors and stockists.

The shear connector is essentially used to transfer shear forces across steel beams and concrete slabs in composite structures. However, conventional methods which rely mainly on the welded stud shear connector are not as efficient in terms of recycling and reusing building components. Therefore, to address the issues of deconstruction and materials reuse and to improve the structural performance of the composite beams, bolted shear connectors have been developed to replace the conventional welded stud. In order to further study their behaviour, the structural performance of the bolted shear connectors were simulated and compared with the welded studs using Abaqus software. A tridimensional numerical model was validated using previously conducted experimental tests and was used as a reference for the parametric study. Height to diameter ratio, friction coefficient of steel-concrete interface, and concrete strength were selected as the main variables for the parametric study, along with the effects of the bolt-hole clearance. The results of numerical simulation were used to develop shear stress and ductility criteria of the innovative shear connector for design rules. The results of parametric studies also showed that the load carrying capacity of composite beams using the bolted shear connectors is influenced by the bolt's height, the friction coefficient of contact surfaces and the concrete strength.

The current work focuses on the behavior of structural normal steel (hot-rolled and cold-formed) and high-strength bolts after exposure to elevated temperatures.

Design/methodology/approach - Because of the complexity of the issue, an elaborate presentation of the mechanical properties influencing factors is followed. Subsequently, a wide range of experimental studies is extensively reviewed in the literature while simplified equations for determining the post-fire mechanical properties are proposed, following appropriate categorization. Moreover, the reinstatement survey is also comprehensively described. Findings - Useful conclusions are drawn for the safe reuse of the structural elements and connection components. According to the parametric investigation of the aforementioned data, it can be safely concluded that the most common scenario of buildings after fire events, i.e. apart from excessively distorted structures, implies considerable remaining capacity of the structure, highlighting that subsequent demolition should not be the case, especially regarding critical infrastructure and buildings. Originality/value - The stability of the structure as a whole is addressed, with aim to establish specific guidelines and code provisions for the correct appraisal and rehabilitation of fire damaged structures.",,2017.0,10.1108/JSFE-03-2017-0028,0.0

Besides, construction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. According to the waste hierarchies, reuse is preferred to recycling; however, most of the recovery of construction and demolition wastes happens in the form of recycling and not reuse. Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts' opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study. Furthermore, the results of the survey are used to develop an easy-to-understand learner for assessing the technical reusability of the structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. The results indicate that the most significant factors affecting the reuse of building structural components are design-related including, matching the design of the new building with the strength of the recovered element.",OCT,2021.0,10.1016/j.jobe.2021.102791,0.0

The results showed that the fatigue performance of structural steel is better than the WAAM stainless steel, the fatigue performance vertical to printing direction (WAAM-900) is better than it along the printing direction (WAAM00). In addition, the fatigue cycle of the transition reversals of structural steel is much less than it of WAAM stainless. With the increasing the fatigue cycle, the maximum density of the strain amplitude ratio is gradually increased to 1.0.

This can be partly explained by the many barriers which have been identified in the literature, but a detailed analysis of how these barriers affect different parts of the supply chain is still lacking. We show that there is a contrast between perceived higher costs and time required to employ reused steel and the assessments of realised projects. Using a novel ranking method inspired from the field of information retrieval (tf-idf), we have analysed interviews of actors across the supply chain to determine the acuteness of the perception of each barrier. We show that demolition contractors, stockists, and fabricators face specific barriers which each need to be addressed at their level. This is in contrast with more generic barriers present throughout the value chain which we show are probably more perception than reality.

Demountability and reuse of structures contributes to the reduction of the environmental impact of the built environment. Welded headed studs used in traditional steel-concrete composite floor systems need to be replaced by demountable shear connectors to enable the transition of the construction sector to a circular business model. The demountable shear connectors are embedded in large prefabricated concrete floor elements and connected to steel beams by bolts. The holes in the beam flange are oversized to account for geometrical and dimensional deviations of all members and to facilitate rapid execution and easy demounting. The goal of this paper is to present a methodology that quantifies the required nominal hole clearance for reusable composite floor systems. Statistical characteristics of dimensional and geometrical deviations serve as input for Monte-Carlo simulations. The aggregated results of the Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine the required nominal hole clearance for a specified probability of successful installation of the demountable shear connectors. The proposed methodology is applied to the composite floor system of a demountable and reusable car park building. The contradicting requirement of oversized holes and composite interaction is solved by injecting the hole clearance with a (steel-reinforced) epoxy resin. The bearing resistance of the (steel-reinforced) epoxy resin is addressed based on preliminary results of creep experiments on resin-injected bolted connections.,APR,2020.0,10.1016/j.istruc.2020.01.021,0.0

Fracture failure in steel structures should be prevented to avoid collapse of the whole structures.

Twelve smooth round bars were carried out to obtain the material properties and 36 notched round bars were tested to calibrate the parameters of stress modified critical strain (SMCS) model and the void growth model (VGM) for structural steels ( Q235B and Q345B) and the corresponding welds. Specimens were extracted from the base metal, the weld metal and the heat affected zone (HAZ) to investigate fracture behaviour in different parts of the welded joint. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements were taken and finite element models were developed to calibrate the models. The test results and calibrated parameters are reported. Moreover, the calibrated models are applied to analyses the fracture behaviour of welded joints and their accuracy are validated.

Therefore, Research and Development (R&D) of novel manufacturing technologies and green construction materials is becoming extremely compelling. This study aims at evaluating the reuse of various wastes, originated in the Kraft pulp-paper industry, as raw materials in the manufacture of novel geopolymeric (GP) mortars whose properties fundamentally depend on the target application (e.g., insulating panel, partition wall, structural element, furnishing, etc.). Five different wastes were reused as filler: Two typologies of Biomass Fly Ash, calcareous sludge, grits, and dregs. The produced samples were characterized and a multi criteria analysis, able to take into account not only the engineering properties, but also the environmental and economic aspects, has been implemented. The criteria weights were evaluated using the Delphi methodology. The fuzzy Topsis approach has been used to consider the intrinsic uncertainty related to unconventional materials, as the produced GP-mortars. The computational analysis showed that adding the considered industrial wastes as filler is strongly recommended to improve the performance of materials intended for structural applications in construction. The results revealed that the formulations containing 5 wt.% of calcareous sludge, grits, and dregs and the one containing 7.5 wt.% of calcareous sludge, grits, dregs, and Biomass Fly Ash-1 have emerged as the best alternatives. Furthermore, it resulted that the Biomass Fly Ash-2 negatively influences the structural performance and relative rank of the material. Finally, this case study clearly shows that the fuzzy Topsis multi-criteria analysis represents a valuable and easy tool to investigate construction materials (either traditional and unconventional) when an intrinsic uncertainty is related to the measurement of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics.",AUG,2020.0,10.3390/su12155987,0.0

The paper examines whether Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology coupled with Building Information Modelling (BIM) may enable components and/or assemblies to be tracked and imported into virtual models for new buildings at the design stage. The addition of stress sensors to components, which provides the capability of quantifying the stress properties of steel over its working life, may also support best practice reuse of resources. The potential to improve resource efficiency in many areas of production and consumption, emerging from a novel combination of such technologies, is highlighted using a theoretical case study scenario. In addition, a case analysis of the demolition/deconstruction of a former industrial building is conducted to illustrate potential savings in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) from reuse when compared with recycling. The paper outlines the reasoning behind the combination of the discussed technologies and alludes to some possible applications and new business models. For example, a company that currently manufactures and 'sells' steel, or a third party, could find new business opportunities by becoming a 'reseller' of reused steel and providing a 'steel service'. This could be facilitated by its ownership of the database that enables it to know the whereabouts of the steel and to be able to warrant its properties and appropriateness for reuse in certain applications.

The proposed BRB offers ease of postearthquake examination of fuse damage, convenient and prompt replacement of damaged fuses, and reuse of the buckling restraining elements. To investigate seismic behavior of the proposed BRB, seven brace specimens are tested. The test parameters varied in these specimens include fuse design, fuse material, debonding material, and loading protocol. Test results show that the proposed BRB can exhibit stable hysteretic behavior up to fairly high fuse strain levels. Failure modes of the specimens are found to be ruptures of the angle fuses, as expected. The compression strength adjustment factors and the cumulative plastic deformations of the specimens are found to satisfy the requirements specified by the current U.S. seismic design provisions for structural steel buildings. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that specimens repaired through fuse replacement remain satisfactory in following tests. Furthermore, rupture failures of the proposed BRB can be captured by the modified Park-Ang damage measure.

This. interest is driven partly by the recent adoption in Canada of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED (R)) Green Building Rating System and partly by a greater general awareness of environmental issues. Designers are beginning to look at how to incorporate reused steel components into construction projects, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions by saving on primary steel production. However, although some designers are willing to redesign their projects to make use of available reclaimed structural steel components, it is often difficult to identify suitable materials in the local area at the appropriate time in the life of a project. A limiting factor is that designers, construction companies, and others perceive a lack of a well-established and easily available mechanism for exchange of reclaimed components.

In a building the walls, floors and roofs are the most important sections, which can be analyzed distinctively based on the needs, thus, improving the speed of construction and reducing the construction cost. This paper also aims to cover the use of local materials in the different components of building to make them as low cost available solutions for low income groups. To own a house by middle and lower income groups in today's economic trends is very difficult. Therefore, it has now became a necessity to adopt cost effective, innovative and environment-friendly housing technologies for the construction of houses and buildings and availing them at low cost comparatively. In order to come up with viable solutions this paper compares the construction cost for the traditional and low cost housing technologies and it was observed that with the use of technology and reuse of waste material as building material the cost of construction can be minimized to an extent. It was observed that with if the filler slab can be used as an alternative to conventional slab the cost of construction can reduce upto 25%. With the time more studies are going to identify the reuse of waste material like fly ash, rice husk, etc as building material. After realizing the true potential of these waste materials as building material in construction industry the cost can be minimized to a greater extent.

Geometric characterization is demonstrated in this article to have a key role to play in the decision process for each case of potential steel reuse, because it is necessary for identifying unknown in situ member sizes and assembly geometries, and for quantifying uncertainty when assessing the reliability of a structure. Without automation of this analysis, it is speculated that such a detailed decision making process would not be feasible. The key role of geometric characterization is demonstrated in this article through a series of remote, 3D imaging experiments and reliability analyses. The reliability analysis demonstrated that automated geometric identification using an algorithm developed for the current study results in a 56% reduction in capacity when compared to similar new steel members. Alternatively, more manual methods of remote geometry detection resulted in only a 2% reduction in capacity. It is concluded that semi-automated geometric characterization has the potential to support increased steel reuse through reduced identification costs and improved reliability. A new set of methods and an understanding of their utility in making reuse more attractive through reduced costs and improved reliability is thus contributed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, in the UK, work by Sansom and Avery (2014) suggests a picture of declining levels of reuse. This paper explores why this is the case by identifying the practical barriers to structural steel reuse through a series of semi structured interviews with UK construction industry members. Whilst there were many identified barriers, five practical barriers were prioritised as being most significant: cost, availability/storage, no client demand, traceability and supply chain gaps/lack of integration. These contrast with those most commonly identified in global literature: cost, supply chain gaps/integration, risk, jointing technique, composite construction and time for deconstruction; with only two overlaps: cost and supply chain gaps/integration. Many of the barriers from literature have a technical focus (reducing salvage yield rather than completely preventing reuse) differing from the largely systemic barriers that the interviews prioritised. These systemic barriers will need to be dealt with first to increase reuse rates. This will require a coordinated approach across the UK construction supply chain. Building on interview insights, this paper proposes four mechanisms to overcome these systemic barriers: (1) the creation of a database of suppliers/reused section availability, (2) a demonstration of client demand (3) technical guidance and education for the construction industry and (4) government leadership. Together these mechanisms would improve reuse rates in the UK, reduce the embodied emissions of the built environment and play a crucial role in meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.

The former two are loaded to service, unloaded, demounted and reassembled; all three are tested to failure. The results show that all three have higher strengths than predicted using Eurocode 4.
