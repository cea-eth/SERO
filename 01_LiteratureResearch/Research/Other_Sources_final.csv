This happens because the construction sector mostly adopts a linear economic model of “take, make, dispose”, using materials to the construction of buildings and disposing them at the end of life, since they are assembled for one time use and don’t retain potential for reuse. Over the last decades, a paradigm shift has been occurring in the industry at large, with the adoption of a Circular Economy model, that aims at keeping the materials in a closed loop to retain their maximum value, therefore with a greater potential of reducing the waste generation and resources extraction for the Construction Industry. This article aims at ﬁnding the recent developments of how Circular Economy can be used inside the construction industry. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature review was conducted, including 45 articles that were divided into six areas of research: development of Circular Economy, reuse of materials, material stocks, Circular Economy in the built environment, LCA analysis and material passport. An analysis of the content of these articles was made and the knowledge gaps in this area were identiﬁed, as well as table with known Circular Economy practices for the Construction Industry was created divided by life cycle stages. Finally, a discussion of each area of research and their ﬁndings is made.",2020-07,,,2.0,Introduction - Explanation of CE and role of Reuse

At the end of their life cycles, these materials are considered valuable sources of secondary materials. The increasing construction and demolition waste released from aging stock each year make up the heaviest, most voluminous waste outﬂow, presenting challenges and opportunities. These material stocks should be utilized and exploited since the reuse and recycling of construction materials would positively impact the natural environment and resource efﬁciency, leading to sustainable cities within a grander scheme of a circular economy. The exploitation of material stock is known as urban mining. In order to make these materials accessible for future mining, material quantities need to be estimated and extrapolated to regional levels. This demanding task requires a vast knowledge of the existing building stock, which can only be obtained through labor-intensive, time-consuming methodologies or new technologies, such as building information modeling (BIM), geographic information systems (GISs), artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), and machine learning.

2,document,"Heinrich, Matthias",Material flows of the German building sector,,,,"According to estimates of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, the German building stock contains around 10.5 billion tonnes of mineral building materials, around 220 million tonnes of timber products and around 100 million tonnes of metals. Due to continuous building activities, especially renovation and retrofit measures, it is estimated that this raw material stock will grow by a further 20 % until 2050 [1]. Every year more than 450 million tonnes (5.6 t/person) of mineral raw materials (e.g. sand, gravel) and more than 15.5 million tonnes (194 kg/person) of metals (e.g. steel, aluminium, copper) are required within the sector for maintaining and constructing new buildings. The focus of this paper is the analysis of construction related raw material flows using material flow analysis (MFA) in Germany. To provide system control options in a circular economy, a deeper knowledge about material flows and stocks is required. A large range of statistical data (e.g. production, import/export, waste etc.) was evaluated and disaggregated, to investigate the impact and self-supply potential through secondary materials, of the German building industry. Currently, the demand cannot be covered by recycled materials leaving the building sector and further primary raw materials are needed. Potentially, only 18 % of the mineral raw materials can be substituted by recycled construction waste. In contrast, for steel and aluminium the substitution rate has reached levels over 40 %.",,,,3.0,Introduction - Context Steel Reuse and Material Flows

Initially seen mostly	(if	not	only)	through	the	lens	of	energy	efficiency during the use phase, this concern is now being extended to include the whole life cycle of buildings	 and	their	 components.	 More	 specifically, the environmental impacts arising from the manufacturing of building materials have become a major point of attention. Since the production stage of the building materials can comprise up to 50% of all the environmental impacts of new and low energy buildings throughout their whole life-cycle [Douguet, 2021], this represents important leverage to minimise the environmental damage of the construction industry. In this regard, reusing1 building materials and components	 is	a	particularly	 efficient	 strategy	 for cutting down these impacts. Indeed, reusing existing elements prevents having to produce new ones and, therefore, avoids all the impacts related to their manufacture. Most of the time, the operations needed to reclaim a material (cleaning, sorting,	 restoring,	 etc.)	 are	quite	 light	 and	mostly	 labour-intensive (rather than energy-intensive). Reuse also fosters a local economy and enables the preservation of the cultural value embedded in building materials. Over the last few years, various organisations have	 developed	 different	 tools	 aimed	 at	assisting	 project developers in assessing (and by extension improving) the environmental impact of their building, including regarding the choice of building materials and components. In this report, we analyse environmental impact assessment (EIA) tools from a triple perspective: Introduction 1. Set the general context and understand how they work. 2. Understand if and how they model the environmental	 impacts	 and	 benefits	 of	 reusing building materials. 3. Learn from good practices to foster the further adoption of reuse practices by construction professionals. The report is a deliverable of the FCRBE project, an Interreg NWE project aiming at developing reuse practices within the construction industry.	 More	 specifically,	 it	is	part	 of	a	facet	 of	 this project addressing the roll-out of reuse practices in the long term. For the construction industry to adopt more systematically reuse practices, it needs a general context favourable to reuse. This entails, among other things: • The development and implementation of reuse-friendly public policies (addressed in the FCRBE deliverable LT 1.1) • An	acknowledgement	 of	the	benefits	 of	 reuse strategies in green building rating systems (addressed in the FCRBE deliverable LT 1.3) • A close incorporation of reuse considerations in environmental-impact modelling and decision-making tools used by project developers (the topic of the present report).",,,,3.0,Introduction - Why Reuse is important and it's impact

9,conferencePaper,"Durmisevic, Elma",Systemic view on Reuse Potential of building elements components and systems - Comprehensive Framework for assessing Reuse Potential of Building Elements,,,,"The physical impact of the increasing building mass in industrial and developing parts of the world is undeniable. In Europe, the building industry accounts for 38 percent of the total waste production, 40 percent of the CO2 emissions and 50 percent of all natural resources used within the building sector. (EIB 2015) Such negative impact of the construction sector is primarily related to the fact that built environment has been optimized for a linear system and one end of life option, demolition. The design of building products with high reuse potential is a necessity to move towards a construction industry that (1) creates building products with an increasing resource productivity; (2) is less dependent on virgin resources and; (3) contributes to the elimination of the concept of waste. As part of the EU Buildings as Material Banks project this paper will discuss the broader framework of a tool that will be able to assess reuse potential of building and its components and enhance their future environmental and economic value propositions. Due to the systemic nature of the tool the paper will showcase several case projects and the assessment of reuse potential indicators, measuring functional, technical and material dependences on three levels of a building’s composition (i.e. building, system, and component). Further to this the relation will be made between indicators of reuse potential with different value propositions based on which the framework for measuring environmental and economic impact of different reuse options will be established. Finally the paper will elaborate on gaps between design related data and existing capacity of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for the purpose of integrating the Reuse Potential Tool with BIM .",2017-06-23,,,1.0,Reusability

12,conferencePaper,"Hobbs, Gilli; Adams, Katherine",Reuse of building products and materials – barriers and opportunities,,,,"BRE have been working with the reclamation sector in the UK for around 20 years to promote the reuse of end-of-life building products and materials in preference to recycling and recovery. Much of this has been dedicated to the promotion of pre-demolition and prerefurbishment audits to facilitate targets being set and markets for reusable resources sourced prior to work commencing. Against this backdrop the surveys undertaken to measure levels of reclamation in the UK over a 15 year period showed a significant decline. The cause of this decline was investigated and revealed a number of challenges which were affecting both the supply and demand for reclaimed products and materials. Many of the challenges to reuse are connected to the availability and robustness of data. Therefore, the work currently being undertaken as part of the H2020 funded project BAMB (Building As Material Banks) provides a great opportunity to address such gaps in buildings of the future. However, since the existing built environment will have a major impact on resource flows for many years, it is also important to consider approaches to improve data in this context also. Therefore, this presentation will summarise the challenges for reuse of building products and materials in existing and future buildings. It will then briefly describe the opportunities and solutions to address these challenges in the context of improved data access, management and evaluation. Finally, the BAMB research which should contribute to providing solutions will be explored.",,,,1.0,Reuse - why it is important and connection to data
13,conferencePaper,"Henrotay, C.",How do current policies support a transition towards a circular economy in the built environment?,,,,"Building and construction industry consumes huge quantities of materials in an unsustainable way. As a result of a linear design approach and economic model, at the end of use, but also throughout the cycle, buildings or parts of buildings are demolished and remnants treated as waste or –best case– down-cycled. This creation of waste as well as the use of virgin resources leads to an important environmental, economic and societal impact. To create a sustainable build environment, the building sector needs to move towards a circular economy in which circular and dynamic buildings as well as their component and materials preserve value. Policies and regulations in member states and across the EU will influence the ability to transition to a circular economy – positively and negatively. Within the H2020 Buildings As Materials Banks (BAMB) Project work is underway to understand where the opportunities and barriers lie in a complex and, sometimes contradictory, regulatory landscape. This paper presents an overview of the current policy instruments that are considered to have relevance in relation to promoting, or possibly hindering, the adoption of circular economy opportunities in the built environment. The analysis of the current policy instruments has been done on a European level and on a member state level for 4 different countries being: Belgium, Portugal, Sweden and UK.

Within the H2020 project “Building as Material Banks” (BAMB), two innovative solutions are being forward to support this transition: i.e. Materials Passports and Reversible Building Design Protocols. Based on desk research and interviews with frontrunners, key opportunities and barriers have been identified related to the implementation of both innovative solutions within policy, commercial, societal and R&D realms. In order to better understand these opportunities and barriers five emerging trends putting the current socio-technical system under pressure are explained. In addition, value chain and value network analyses of business-as-usual and stateof-the-art practices have been examined over major building phases: conceptualisation & design, construction, usage/operation, demolition/deconstruction & repurposing. We observed that that it is unlikely that an actor will be involved within all phases of the building and that the availability of building (product) information over all building phases is restricted. By supporting the development of Materials Passports and Reversible Building Design Protocols actors involves within the conceptualisation, design and construction stages will better understand why circular and change-supporting building design strategies are necessary. Moreover, the development of Materials Passport IT Platform and a BIM prototype will serve as a proof-of-concept on exchanging information on building products and the building's operation to actors involved within reverse logistics.",,,,2.0,Look into the Material Passport IT Platform and BIM-Prototype

Components that make up the existing building stock must be better characterised to prevent them becoming waste. The first record of materials in an existing building is often the waste report, which classifies materials for waste management and gathers information after the opportunity for higher-value reuse of components has passed. Policy at various levels aims to increase reuse, but an understanding of ‘existing buildings as material banks’ (E-BAMB) is a necessary precursor to overcoming other barriers. This paper reviews the current means of understanding E-BAMB and identifies its shortfalls. This analysis leads to the conception of a strategy in which the various approaches are organised as an information system. The future role of technology and mandatory provision of E-BAMB information at the planning stage are explored. The proposed system would enable specifiers, manufacturers and academics to assess the wealth of materials that can be reused, repurposed or upcycled in new projects or businesses.

Data availability about the material contents of buildings is significant challenge for planning future re-use potentials. Compiling material intensity (MI) data is time and resource intensive. Often studies end up with only a handful of datapoints. In order to adequately cover the diversity of buildings and materials found in cities, and accurately assess material stocks at detailed spatial scopes, many more MI datapoints are needed. In this work, we present a database on the material intensity of the Dutch building stock, containing 61 large-scale demolition projects with a total of 781 datapoints, representing more than 306,000 square meters of built floor space. This dataset is representative of the types of buildings being demolished in the Netherlands. Our data were empirically sourced in collaboration with a demolition company that explicitly focuses on re-using and recycling materials and components. The dataset includes both the structural building materials and component materials, and covers a wide range of building types, sizes, and construction years. Compared to the existing literature, this paper adds significantly more datapoints, and more detail to the different types of materials found in demolition streams. This increase in data volume is a necessary step toward enabling big data methods, such as data mining and machine learning.

Reuse of building elements can, accordingly, reduce both new production and waste. Before any element can be reused, demolition contractors ﬁrst need to recover it. Previous research has not yet explored why such ﬁrms opt to recover some elements and destruct other ones. This research therefore attempts to understand the (socio-technical) conditions which lead to the recovery of a building element for reuse. Data collection consisted of approximately 250 h of (ethnographic) participant observations during the course of a partial selective demolition project in the Netherlands, complemented with semi-structured interviews and project documentation. An analytic induction method was adopted to analyze the data collected. This resulted in a proposition strongly grounded in the data: a building element will be recovered for reuse only when the demolition contractor: (1) identiﬁes an economic demand for the element; (2) distinguishes appropriate routines to disassemble it; and (3) can control the performance until integration in a new building. In-depth insights and practical strategies are provided for each of the three recovery conditions that this proposition captures.

The RFCS-funded project PROGRESS (PROvisions for GREater reuse of Steel Structures) focused on single-storey buildings, and it identified various reuse scenarios, depending on the form of construction. It also showed how these structures can be designed to facilitate reuse of the structure or its primary components. The scope of physical reuse of structural steel is limited to: • Members to be reused should not be subject to localised corrosion or damage, • All members to be reused should come from a building structure first constructed after 1970, which is about the time when the Limit State design became common practice, • All salvaged primary members are rolled steel sections.

Still, they contribute the most to the material weight and embodied impacts of buildings and infrastructures. The reuse of structural components therefore offers great potential to save materials, energy and resources. While historic and contemporary projects highlight the environmental, time or cost benefits of building with reclaimed elements, many technological challenges remain. This paper gives an overview of buildings that efficiently reuse structural components as well as a review of current research efforts addressing structural reuse. The first case study is the design process of an elastic gridshell made from reclaimed skis. This project demonstrates the potential of ensuring structural performance while working with uncharacterized and heterogeneous materials. In general, designing structures from a stock of reclaimed elements entails reversing the conventional structural design process. The synthesis of structures has to follow the availability of elements and their mechanical and geometric properties. Developed tools that facilitate such design from reused elements while minimizing embodied environmental impacts are presented in this paper. A second case study demonstrates the relevance of such tools through a conceptual train station roof made from electric pylon elements. Lastly, some key challenges related to the design of structural systems from reused elements are presented. These research initiatives constitute a first step to understand and support the design of load-bearing systems from reused elements and hence to bring the construction industry closer to circular economy.",2019-02-24 00:00:00,,,1.0,Reuse of Load bearing components - Steel beam reuse - information

Rather, reused steel is somewhat more expensive than new elements, except in certain circumstances such as when the reused elements are available from a nearby site, or when testing elements can be avoided. Further, we show that neither the costs of steel reuse, nor the risks, nor its beneﬁts are spread equitably throughout the construction industry supply chain: most of the substantial and capital-intensive changes required for the widespread adoption of steel reuse are concentrated on steelwork contractors and stockists.

We’re talking of course, about metal products. Next to “virgin” metal (metal from primary resources, e.g. iron ore), recycled or ‘scrap’ metal is used to create products. Whilst the use of recycled metals saves a lot of energy and processes compared to virgin metals production, the use of virgin metal is still a necessity. This is due to the demand of metal products exceeding the supply of scrap, and because desired composition of metal products is achieved by diluting recycled metal with virgin material. Moving toward using 100% recycled, healthy metals for products will require a more symbiotic and collaborative approach from all players within the field. In this report, the challenges of the metals recycling industry moving towards a circular economy are detailed.

Adaptive reuse has the potential to maximize the residual utility and value of existing assets through green design methods such as selective disassembly planning. Studies in the ﬁeld of selective disassembly are scarce and there is no evidence of established methodologies for the optimization of the environmental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts. A multi-objective analysis is key to obtaining several eﬀective selective disassembly plans for the adaptive reuse of an existing asset through the combination of diﬀerent deconstruction methods. The analysis is carried out in terms of the physical, environmental, and economic constraints of the deconstruction methods per building component. The Sequential Disassembly Planning for Buildings (SDPB) method is used in order to generate the optimized disassembly plans for retrieving target components. At the end, a weighted multi-objective optimization analysis is incorporated to generate the set of noninferior solutions that minimizes environmental impacts and building cost. The results show that diﬀerent complete disassembly plans exist for all the possible combinations. The possible combinations are driven by the deconstruction methods per component, as well as the dismantling interdependence. The method described in this study can be used to improve the project outcomes according to speciﬁc goals and constraints (e.g. environmental, economic, technical).

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables.

Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts’ opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study.

Results indicate that addressing the economic, social and regulatory barriers should be prioritized. Although the impact of barriers under perception, risk, compliance and market subcategories are very pronounced, the highest inter-dependency among the sub-categories is found between perception and risk.

It consumes more than half of the total global resources; it is responsible for more than a third of the total global energy use and associated emissions; and generates the greatest and most voluminous waste stream globally. Reuse is considered to be a material and carbon saving practice highly recommended in the construction sector as it can address both waste and carbon emission regulatory targets. This practice offers the possibility to conserve resources through the reclamation of structural components and the carbon embedded in them, as well as opportunities for the development of new business models and the creation of environmental, economic, technical and social value. This paper focuses on the identiﬁcation and analysis of existing interventions that can promote the reuse of construction components, and outlines the barriers and opportunities arising from this practice as depicted from the global literature. The main conclusions that derive from this study are that the combination of incentives that promote reuse of construction components and recycling of the rest of the construction materials with the provision of specialised education, skills and training would transform the way construction sector currently operates and create opportunities for new business development. Moreover, a typology system developed based on the properties and lifetime of construction components is required in order to provide transparency and guidance in the way construction components are used and reused, in order to make them readily available to designers and contractors.

The most evident effect is that landfill capacity is being used up. Therefore, a systematic approach to recycling is both urgent and imperative. It has been also recognized that appropriate disassembly of used products is necessary in order to make recycling economically and environmentally viable in the current state of the art reprocessing technology. This paper proposes a graph-based heuristic approach to the disassembly model. The model is embedded on a graph representation and object-oriented modeling, which is obtained by generating disassembly sequences. Information exchange within the disassembly model is done through three phases: (1) disassembly analysis, (2) database and data management, and (3) recycling cost minimization. With graph representation, the problem of identifying the optimal disassembly and recycling strategy is transformed into a graph search problem.

The integration of IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) data as a general building information standard is one of the indispensable functions in collaborative work. The most practical approach of merging IFC data depends on GUID (Global Universal Identifier) comparison at present. However, GUID is not stable in current applications and often changes when exported. The intact representation of relationships between IFC entities is an essential prerequisite for proper association of IFC entities in IFC mergence. This paper proposes a graph-based method for IFC data merging. The IFC data are represented as a graphical data structure, which completely preserves the relationship between IFC entities. IFC mergence is accomplished by associating other data with an isomorphic graph that is obtained by mining the IFC graph. The feasibility of the method is proven by a program, and the method can ignore the impacts of GUID and other factors.",2020-07-26,,,3.0,Look at conclusion. Pro for using GraphBased DB?

61,thesis,"Nahar, Ahmed",Applying graph theory concepts for analyzing BIM models based on IFC standards,,,,"Labeled property graph models are a suitable way for representing and describing the vast amount of information inside Building Information Models (BIMs). Where graph models can be automatically generated based on data extracted from Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) models. The aim of this master thesis is to study the potential of using graph databases and the concepts of graph theory to manage, visualize and analyze the information inside BIMs. This can be done through for example through applying data retrieval queries, applying pathfinding algorithms and analyzing the complex relationships between the BIM model entities. The IFC data model is used in the present study to build the graph database; therefore, a brief background on IFC data schema architecture is presented to build-up basic understanding on how IFC models are encoded. This is followed by an introduction to graph theory concepts and graph databases, with the aim to investigate the capabilities of graph models in representing complex and rich datasets such as BIM models. The research proposes a generic approach to create two kinds of graph models: (1) IFC Meta Graph (IMG) model based on the IFC EXPRESS schema and (2) IFC Objects Graph (IOG) model based on STEP physical file format. The IFC EXPRESS schema is used as data source to generate the IMG model to graphically represent the IFC classes and the relationships. The IMG model expresses the classes and their attributes as nodes, and the relationships between them as edges. While, the IFC objects model files are used to build the IOG models, where IFC data are extracted through an IFC data model server and then imported into graph database management system (www.neo4j.com). In both cases of graph modeling, there is a need for a third-party system to enable the data transmission process from the IFC schema/models to Neo4j database. Therefore, the IFC data model server www.ifcwebserver.org has been used to generate the graph query statements scripts and extract the IFC data in form of comma-separated values (CSV) data files for exportation into the Neo4j graph database. This is following by application of graph queries and filters to visualize and analyze building information and to explore the capabilities of graph database in answering realistic questions in building projects particularly. And secondly, to provide a tool for a comparison study of different IFC standard releases or different IFC model versions, when a single graph database is used to storage various IFC models. Finally, the graph model is used for indoor navigation applications in buildings using spatial and geometric information extracted from the IFC model.",2017,,,1.0,Understanding of IFC and Graph-Databases / Graph-Theory.

The framework for materials passports includes contributions of BAMB partners and was mainly developed by EPEA and SundaHus. Components In order to understand how the framework fits together, brief descriptions of its main components are provided below: Materials passports (MP) are (digital) sets of data describing defined characteristics of materials and components in products and systems that give them value for present use, recovery, and reuse. Materials passport platform (MPP) is a software platform to create materials passports. The proof of concept (PoC) is the software platform developed as the first version of the MPP. It was developed in deliverable D6 and some aspects of it will be optimised as part of other tasks to aid the production of 300 MP mandated in deliverable D7. Development Process & Content Based on Value for Users The guiding objective of MP and the MPP is to provide value for users, a primary way this is reflected is in the data MP are developed to support. Value is described here as “value propositions.” Value propositions were created through a consultative process that included:  Identifying a total of 21 stakeholder groups as potential users across the building cycle, including for example manufacturers, contractors, occupants, regulators, and recyclers. Surveying a selection of users about their preferences, or user requirements, and conducting an investigation into related platforms and tools in WP1 D1 Synthesis of the state-of-the-art.  Crafting results into value propositions. A main learning was that priorities differ depending on the user, so the platform has to be adaptable for each user’s preference.  Integrating results into a MP input workbook with questions designed to identify those values, and then developing examples of how the system will be used, referred to here as system use cases. Tagging the input fields was started in order to connect value propositions to each input, so users see which input relates to which value.  Using the workbook and system use cases as a basis for the D6 team to develop the PoC platform and for the D5 team to generate this report. A priority identified by many users is that MP must deliver immediate and short-term value additional to providing tools to estimate long term value of materials. Value propositions like reduced construction waste disposal costs, improved environmental performance, quicker maintenance, more cost-effective data management, and healthier buildings rank alongside long-term recoverability of materials. For example, as healthy buildings and productivity of occupants increase in importance, materials health ranks higher for owners and occupants. Materials health also contributes to improving residual value of those materials so they are not liabilities when recovered. Calculating materials health involves more than just totaling the contents of buildings. Those types of values have basic impacts on the type of data gathered for MP and how the MPP is designed.",,,,2.0,Challenges and Requirements for MPP (Material Passport Plattform).

It examines the need of NoSQL and how they have become an important alternative to relational databases. NoSQL databases can be categorized into four major classifications which are: key value stores, graph databases, wide column stores, and document stores. These categories are compared on the basis of functional features and non-functional features. The non-functional features include performance, scalability, flexibility, structure and complexity. The functional features include de-normalization, joins, atomicity, aggregation and keys. Then for further analysis, one database is selected from each of these categories that is, MongoDB (document stores), Cassandra (wide column stores), Redis (key value stores), and Neo4j (graph databases). Selected databases are compared on their data model, CAP theorem, distributive properties and other factors. By performing the comparison on non-functional features, it has been found that a document store can be used if high performance, flexibility and scalability are required and if we have represented the data in JSON format. Column store can be used for semi structured data which requires high performance and scalability. Redis is aninmemory store and performs exceptionally fast in the case of single shard operation. Graph databases can be used when it comes to highly interconnected data and continuously evolving data models. The comparison between MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis and Neo4j concluded that all of them follow horizontal scaling and are schema free. Except Neo4j, others don’t have complete ACID properties. Write and delete operations are fast for databases MongoDB, Redis and Cassandra, whereas read operation is comparatively slow in Cassandra. In case of Neo4j, REST performance is similar to MongoDB, whereas embedded is comparatively slow.

As the construction industry transitions to a circular economy, adequate information flow is necessary to keep products in the value chain for as long as possible. Industrialized construction firms show high potential for a successful transition to a circular economy because of optimized information flow through the use of product platforms, the use of information communication technologies, and the integration of actors. However, there is no current framework to assess whether construction firms using industrialized construction methods have a circular information flow. In this research, four characteristics are identified as main descriptors of a circular information flow framework: Completeness, Availability, Accessibility, and Incorporation of Information into Business Strategy. Using the framework, industrialized construction firms are asked to self-assess their performance through pre-defined survey questions. The findings from sixteen industrialized construction firms reveal the need for more complete data about recyclability potentials of products and unique materials and product identifiers, with 47% of firms indicating they have insufficient information. The survey of companies also indicates a need for more feedback about the reuse, recycling, and remanufacturing phases to be available, with only 20% of firms gathering feedback about reuse, 13% about recycling, and 20% about remanufacturing. The stakeholders with the most consistent access to information about design and materials of a project are the manufacturer, engineer, architect, and assemblers. 13% of firms employed RFID tags.

For upcoming, new approaches to store building data, such as the Semantic Web, no universal common agreement exists on the combination of geometric and non-geometric data. It can therefore be unclear to users on how to represent their geometries, leading to a decelerated application and advancement of making building data available over the web. This gap can only be bridged if a common approach on the representation of geometries on the web is achieved. To first generate a common understanding of geometry representations, an overview of existing and developing geometry (web) standards needs to be given and discussed, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), CityGML, GeoSPARQL, and the OntoBREP and GEOM ontologies. This discussion needs to consider general contexts, e.g., 2D, 3D, detailed, or tessellated geometries, and specific use cases of the construction industry. Based on these discussions, this paper aims to propose a general recommendation for web-based geometry representations to enhance future applications of building data on the web. Due to the variety of use cases and their requirements, as well as technical constraints based on deviant interpretations of geometry descriptions from different geometry kernels, it became clear, that no approach or standard is generally superior to others. The biggest distinction identified in this paper is posed between the context of visualizing, where simplified, tessellated geometry holds the highest advantage, and (parametric) modeling, which requires semantically detailed geometry representations. Hence, we recommend to interlink non-geometric data with multiple geometry representations, to address all relevant contexts and use cases appropriately. The individual geometry representations should be chosen based on the relevant use cases for an optimal experience when using and exchanging geometry on the web. With this recommendation, the benefits of all discussed approaches can be exploited while avoiding their respective challenges.",2019-07-01 00:00:00,,,3.0,Read Conclusion. Purely out of interest.

One of the central concepts in this area is the Semantic Web, with the vision of providing a well-deﬁned meaning to information and services on the Web through a set of standards. Particularly, linked data and ontologies have been quite essential for data sharing, discovery, integration, and reuse. In this paper, we provide a systematic literature review on knowledge graph creation from structured and semi-structured data sources using Semantic Web technologies. The review takes into account four prominent publication venues, namely, Extended Semantic Web Conference, International Semantic Web Conference, Journal of Web Semantics, and Semantic Web Journal. The review highlights the tools, methods, types of data sources, ontologies, and publication methods, together with the challenges, limitations, and lessons learned in the knowledge graph creation processes.",2022-04-24 00:00:00,,,1.0,Semantics and Knowledge Graphs

These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry deﬁned through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology. In making this analysis, we present our implementations of an EXPRESS-to-OWL converter and the key features of the resulting ifcOWL ontology.",2016-03-01 00:00:00,,,2.0,"Ontologies, Semantics and linked Open Data (LOD) - defintions and better/ deeper understanding"

The conversion from EXPRESS to OWL is of particular use to the architectural design and construction industry, because one of the key data models in this domain, namely the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), is represented using the EXPRESS information modelling language. These conversion efforts have by now resulted in a recommended ifcOWL ontology that stays semantically close to the EXPRESS schema. Two major improvements could be made in addition to this ifcOWL basis. First, the ontology could be split into diverse modules, making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology. Second, geometric aggregated data (e.g. lists of coordinates) could be serialised into alternative, less complex semantic structures. The purpose of both improvements is to make ifcOWL data smaller in size and complexity. In this article, we focus entirely on the second topic, namely the optimization of geometric data in the semantic representation. We outline and discuss the diverse available options in optimizing the data representations used. We quantify the impact of these measures on the ifcOWL ontology and instance model size. We conclude with an explicit recommendation and give an indication of how this recommendation might be implemented in combination with the already available ifcOWL ontology.",2017-08-01 00:00:00,,,3.0,"Ontologies, Semantics and linked Open Data (LOD) - definitions, read conclusion otherwise discard"
