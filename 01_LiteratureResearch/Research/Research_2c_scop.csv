International relations literature has studied order from a simple and classical perspective and the international system is perceived as a linear system, while this is a complex and chaotic. Complexity theory offers a new set of conceptual tools to help explain the global order. It constitutes a challenge to more traditional forms of theorizing in international politics and offers new ways of thinking about it. A new pattern of order is emerging, which can be conceptualized as the dissipative and bifurcated order. Methodology The most prominent methodological aspect of achieving this goal is to utilize the abductive model in theoretical inference and to utilize the complexity-chaos theory assumptions and its conceptualization in the complex international relations. The abduction methodology refers to some form of explanatory reasoning. It refers to the place of explanatory reasoning in generating hypotheses, and also in justifying them. Abduction is finding the best explanation. Chaos and complexity as two important characteristics of the international system lead to dissipative and bifurcated order as the best explanation of the new world order. Results and discussion Complexity theory offers a new set of conceptual tools to help explain the global order. It constitutes a challenge to more traditional forms of theorizing in international politics and offers new ways of thinking about it. A new pattern of order is emerging, which can be conceptualized as the dissipative and bifurcated order. This article seeks to provide a theoretical model for explaining the new order based on the element of complexity and its theories. In this regard, the author pioneers the dissipative and bifurcated order as an innovative theoretical model to the scientific community of international relations. This model is based on the ontology and epistemological foundations of complexity theory. Conclusions The article provides a new theoretical model in the framework of dissipative and bifurcated order by establishing a link between multibody and complex systems theory and international order. The model has the essential features as follows: The multibody system as main construction of new international order; Systemic pressures as the cause of bifurcation, and formation of dissipative structures and processes; Bifurcating and dissipation as the main response to systemic pressures; Feedback strategic stability and feedback strategic deadlock as a new concept to explain the balance of power and dynamic equilibrium; The layered hierarchy as one of the most important theoretical concepts to explain the new order. In this model, polarity is replaced by centrality. The order has two properties, including circularity, centrality-based and layered, nested hierarchy; The convergence of different sub-networks and their dynamics and forming a global nested network along with differentiated clusters; The dissipative and bifurcated control system as the main model of control; The equation of internal order and external disorder. This type of control system provides order by using internal capacities and creating branches in the external Oscillational equilibrium as the main route to evolution. © 2022, Iranian Association of Geopolitics.

This paper uses established ontological criteria to review and improve the CE definition and (assessment) frameworks. The review reveals that mainstream CE definitions and assessments are fuzzy, shift problems, oversimplified and not synchronized. This causes many loopholes that not lead towards sustainability. Therefore, an improved definition and framework is proposed, specifically for CE of XL to XS regions (scales from planetary to neighborhoods). A CE should strive towards self-sufficiency on each scale to avoid problems shifting to other regions or future society. The framework elaborates on a comprehensive systems-approach, which connects the triple bottom line across nine ecosystem processes, eight societal processes, and six economic production processes. The proposed definition and framework are demonstrated in an assessment of regional pressures and their impacts of Australia with 2020 data. The framework aims to better inform decision-makers on trade-offs between vital processes to minimize unintended problem shifting. The definition and framework have improved universal application for meaningful comparisons and optimization towards a sustainable CE in any region. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Assessments; Circular economy; Planetary boundaries; Problem shifting; Regional; Self-sufficiency; System boundaries","Economic and social effects; Ontology; Assessment; Australia; Circular economy; Comprehensive assessment; Neighbourhood; Planetary boundary; Problem shifting; Regional; Self-sufficiency; System boundary; Decision making; economic system; ecosystem management; self sufficiency; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; article; Australia; economic aspect; ecosystem; neighborhood; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135693805

With the high stakes associated with achievements in the field, an increasing emphasis on evaluation, transparency and accountability are to be expected. All require high-quality data, methodologies and tools that are able to improve results and to assess and document the implementation processes and outcomes. A challenging key issue in the implementation of a circular economy is ensuring coordination, control and transparency within a network of parties. Traceability models and systems are vital pillars of such an endeavor, but a preliminary search of the available literature revealed a rather unstable and fragmented research field and practice. The objective of this systematic review was to examine those studies discussing traceability models and traceability systems while connecting traceability capacities and outputs to implement the principles of the circular economy. The literature databases were searched on 6 January 2020, with an update for the entire year of 2020. Overall, 49 studies were included. By addressing eight specific research questions, we found that a link between traceability and the circular economy is yet to be established. Sound research and practice documentation are required to establish evidence regarding this connection, including methodologies that are able to support the design and implementation of business-and lifecycle-oriented, value-based traceability models and traceability systems, along with thorough evaluation methods and tools incorporating economic, social and environmental perspectives. © 2022 by the authors.

Circular economy (CE) which is regenerative and restorative by design is recommended as the business model for resource efficiency. While there is a need for businesses and organisations to switch from linear to CE, there are several challenges that needs addressing such as business models and the criticism of CE projects often being small scale. Technology can be an enabler toward scaling up CE; however, the prime challenge is to identify technologies that can allow predicting, tracking and proactively monitoring product's residual value to motivate businesses to pursue circularity decisions. In this paper, we propose an IoT-enabled decision support system (DSS) for CE business model that effectively allows tracking, monitoring, and analysing products in real time with the focus on residual value. The business model is implemented using an ontological model. This model is complemented by a semantic decision support system. The semantic ontological model, first of its kind, is evaluated for technical compliance. We applied DSS and the ontological model in a real-world use case and demonstrate viability and applicability of our approach. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","circular economy; circular supply chain management; decision support systems; Industry 4.0; Internet of Things; semantic technology; zero waste","Environmental impact; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Ontology; Semantics; Supply chain management; Waste management; Adverse environmental impacts; Business modeling; Circular economy; Decision support system (dss); Ontological modeling; Resource efficiencies; Semantic technologies; Zero waste; Decision support systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082935791

An ontology-based approach is used to manage and centralize the knowledge across the different stages of this methodology. Feasible combinations of operations lead to processing routes connecting waste with products and the paths are assessed to pre-select the most suitable ones. Then, the network is optimized, and a set of configurations are obtained in order to maximize economic profit and minimize environmental impact. The performance of the proposed framework is illustrated through a case study for the treatment of mixed plastic waste. Results show how pyrolysis-based treatments lead to suitable options according to some specified objectives but also reveal the main drawbacks and conditions that these treatments should improve. The work also demonstrates how to efficiently assess a large number of options, and discusses how to build and improve new processing networks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","circular economy; integrated modeling; plastic waste; pyrolysis; sustainable development",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135332675

Implementation, however, is often controversial. In 2018, a Swedish governmental inquiry was commissioned to propose a complete ban on land application of sewage sludge to reduce soil pollution and increase phosphorus recovery. In 2020, the inquiry suggested two pathways, one to ban all land application, and one where agricultural land use should continuously be allowed. This paper is based on interviews with experts tied to the inquiry where they reference to sewage sludge, related objects, and future management. The inquiry’s inability to propose a coherent suggestion is analysed inspired by the concept of multiple ontology. Several ontological versions of sewage sludge emerge that unveil tensions between concepts of danger and cleanliness, pollution and naturalness, often captured in previous studies of waste. Some versions of sewage sludge conflict, which can explain the difficulty to establish an ontologically singular knowledge base for a transformation of sewage sludge from waste to resource. Though most of the experts agree that circular economy and nutrient recycling are good things, policymaking is caught in an ontological conundrum. © 2022 The Author(s).

The main novelties are the introduction of a set of specific dependency patterns and the introduction of a partially revised TRIZ (Russian acronym for “Theory of Inventive Problem Solving”) ontology to classify the retrieved information. The proposed dependency patterns were manually extracted from a sample patents pool about waste recycling and reuse. The classification of the information is based on different classes: (1) what transformations can be carried out on the waste, (2) what technologies can be used to carry out these transformations, (3) what products can be obtained by transforming the waste, (4) what functions can be carried out by the waste, (5) with which technologies, and (6) on which entities. An automatic implementation of the proposed method, involving the manual check of the retrieved results, was tested through a case study about wood chip recycling and reuse. Compared to the dependency patterns from the literature, the proposed ones allowed to retrieve 28 % more pertinent information. This results mainly depends by better ability of the proposed patterns to better discriminate the relevant sentences from which to extract information, compared to the other patterns (i.e. + 40 %).

I first analyze Husserl’s account of the body as a “two-fold unity” and demonstrate the problematic nature of its four implications, namely, the ambiguous ontological status of the body as subject-object, the view of “my body” as “my object,” the preconstitutive character of the unity of the body, and the restriction of the constitution of the body to touch alone. Building on this analysis, I explain how Merleau-Ponty resolves the difficulties raised by Husserl’s account by reversing it. According to Merleau-Ponty, “flesh” is not a two-fold reality comprising subjective and objective aspects, but an ontological dimension from which these aspects can be abstracted through specific cognitive operations. Consequently, all subjective and objective aspects, even beyond the boundaries of one’s body, must be understood as founded in the indivisible unity of flesh. I argue that a thorough phenomenological description of the human body requires abandoning Husserl’s concept of Leib because it contributes to perpetuating subject-object dualism. In contrast, Merleau-Ponty’s notion of flesh reveals the circularity between subject and object and its general ontological significance. © 2021 The University of Memphis",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105085814

The circRNAs are important in virus infection process, but whether circRNAs regulated RABV infection remains largely unknown. Here, mice brain with or without the RABV CVS-11 strain were subjected to RNA sequencing and a total of 30,985 circRNAs were obtained. Among these, 9021 candidates were shared in both groups, and 14,610 and 7354 circRNAs were expressed specifically to the control and experimental groups, indicating that certain circRNAs were specifically inhibited or induced on RABV infection. The circRNAs mainly derived from coding exons. In total, 636 circRNAs were dif-ferentially expressed in RABV infection, of which 426 significantly upregulated and 210 significantly downregulated (p < 0.05 and fold change ≥2). The expression of randomly selected 6 upregulated and 6 downregulated circRNAs was tested by RT-qPCR, and the expression trend of the 11 out of 12 circRNAs was consistent in RT-qPCR and RNA-seq analysis. Rnase R-resistant assay and Sanger sequencing were conducted to verify the circularity of circRNAs. GO analysis demonstrated that source genes of all differentially regulated circRNAs were mainly related to cell plasticity and synapse function. Both KEGG and GSEA analysis revealed that these source genes were engaged in the cGMP–PKG and MAPK signaling pathway, and HTLV-I infection. Also, pathways related to glucose metabolism and synaptic functions were enriched in KEGG analysis. The circRNA–miRNA–mRNA network was built with 25 of 636 differentially expressed circRNAs, 264 mRNAs involved in RABV infection, and 29 miRNAs. Several miRNAs and many mRNAs in the network were reported to be related to viral infection and the immune response, suggesting that circRNAs could regulate RABV infection via interacting with miRNAs and mRNAs. Taken together, this study first characterized the transcriptomic pattern of circRNAs, and signaling pathways and function that circRNAs are involved in, which may indicate directions for further research to understand mechanisms of RABV pathogenesis. © 2021 by the authors.

Valproic acid (VPA) can protect against ischemic damage and promote recovery. In this study, we first determined whether a single dose of VPA after stroke could decrease infarction area or improve functional recovery. Next, we investigated the number and morphological characteristic of peri-infarct microglia at different time points and elucidated the mechanism of microglial response by VPA treatment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAo) for 90 min, followed by reperfusion. Some received a single injection of VPA (200 mg/kg) 90 min after the induction of ischemia, while vehicle-treated animals underwent the same procedure with physiological saline. Infarction volume was calculated at 48 h after reperfusion, and neurological symptoms were evaluated. VPA didn’t significantly reduce infarct volume but did ameliorate neurological deficit at least partially compared with vehicle. Meanwhile, VPA reduced dMCAo-induced elevation of IL-6 at 24 h post-stroke and significantly decreased the number of CD11b-positive microglia within peri-infarct cortex at 7 days. Morphological analysis revealed that VPA therapy leads to higher fractal dimensions, smaller soma size and lower circularity index of CD11b-positive cells within peri-infarct cortex at both 2 and 7 days, suggesting that VPA has core effects on microglial morphology. The modulation of microglia morphology caused by VPA might involve HDAC inhibition-mediated suppression of galectin-3 production. Furthermore, qPCR analysis of CD11b-positive cells at 3 days post-stroke suggested that VPA could partially enhance M2 subset polarization of microglia in peri-infarct cortex. Analysis of VPA-induced changes to gene expressions at 3 days post-stroke implies that these alternations of the biomarkers and microglial responses are implicated in the upregulation of wound healing, collagen trimmer, and extracellular matrix genes within peri-infarct cortex. Our results are the first to show that a low dose of VPA promotes short-term functional recovery but does not alter infarct volume. The decreases in the expression of both IL-6 and galectin-3 might influence the morphological characteristics and transcriptional profiles of microglia and extracellular matrix remodeling, which could contribute to the improved recovery. © Copyright © 2021 Kuo, Wang, Wu, Chen and Tseng.","distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO); galectin-3 (Gal-3); ischemic stroke; microglia activation; valproic acid (VPA)","4 diphenylacetoxy 1 methylpiperidine; activin A; adiponectin; advanced glycation end product receptor; arginine; B7 antigen; beta actin; biological marker; C type lectin domain containing 10A; cadherin; CD11b antigen; CD163 antigen; CD48 antigen; CD86 antigen; chloral hydrate; ciliary neurotrophic factor; CINC2 protein; collagen; collagen 6a2; cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; cytokine; cytokine induced neutrophil chemoattractant; deoxyuridine triphosphate pyrophosphatase; ephrin receptor A5; erythropoietin; fibroblast growth factor; fractalkine; galectin 3; gamma interferon; gelatinase B; glycoprotein gp 130; heat shock protein 70; hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1; histone deacetylase; histone H3; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 2 receptor; interleukin 3; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; junctional adhesion molecule A; lidocaine; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; nerve growth factor receptor; neuropilin 1; Notch2 receptor; pentobarbital; prolactin; prolactin receptor; RANTES; scatter factor receptor; thrombomodulin; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; valproic acid; vasculotropin; vasculotropin receptor; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autoradiography; bioinformatics; blood brain barrier; body temperature; brain cortex; brain infarction size; brain slice; calcium current; cell density; centrifugation; cerebrovascular accident; chemiluminescence immunoassay; circularity index; common carotid artery; controlled study; craniotomy; cytokine production; differentially expressed gene; dorsal striatum; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; excitotoxicity; experimental behavioral test; extracellular matrix; fractal analysis; fractal dimension; functional status; gene expression; gene ontology; genotype phenotype correlation; heart muscle reperfusion; hemisphere; high throughput sequencing; immunofluorescence assay; immunoreactivity; infarct volume; ischemic stroke; locomotion; low drug dose; male; maximum intensity projection; microarray analysis; microglia; microglial cell culture; microscopy; middle cerebral artery occlusion; modified Bedersons score; morphological adaptation; motor activity; neurologic disease; neuroprotection; nonhuman; particle size; periinfarct microglia; polarization; protein degradation; protein expression; protein microarray; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; receptor upregulation; reperfusion; RNA extraction; sequence analysis; single drug dose; stereometry; TGF beta signaling; transcription initiation; ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry; Western blotting; wound healing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107781993

We do this by focusing on the concept of Circular Economy. Circular Economy is often presented as a solution to the problems of a globalized economy in the form of over-exploitation of resources, climate change and pollution of the environment. Within the mainstream economics paradigm, the aim is how to increase the effectiveness of resource extraction and utilization in order to maintain growth. We contrast this with the paradigm of Ecological Economics where the goal of the economy is to achieve and secure a higher quality of life. Circular Economy often side steps the deep ontological and epistemological questions we need to answer if we are to address the complex and interrelated environmental, economic and social problems we face today. This can be a limiting factor in the search for creative and long-term solutions. However, within the Circular Economy discourse, we find strands that critically engage with the foundations of mainstream Economics and so, innovative solutions for the society of the future are a possibility. We argue that to bring about a lasting solution to the interconnected social, economic and environmental problems, Circular Economy must engage with the ontological, epistemological and axiological foundations of mainstream economics. To further this argument, we apply Imre Lakatos’ ‘research program’ model to philosophy of science as our framework of analysis and draw lessons for business and communities. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Circular economy; Ecological economics; Lakatos; Quality of life",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064495686

We aimed to study the circRNAs expression profiles and their functions in osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Firstly, we established osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs displaying increased mRNA expression of osteogenic differentiation marker (RUNX2, OPN, and OCN), increased ALP activity and protein expression, and increased mineralized nodules formation, as well as morphological alteration. Then, we employed high-throughput sequencing to analyze circRNA expression and found that 3440 and 3893 circRNAs in non-induced and induced groups, respectively. We further validated the 10 differentially expressed circRNAs with the most significant difference between induced and non-induced groups. Among these ten circRNAs, five of them with more than one miRNA binding site were used to construct a ceRNA network exhibiting 81 miRNAs and 182 target mRNAs. Furthermore, among these five circRNAs, we found only circ_0005564 significantly reduced the mRNA expression of RUNX2, OPN, and OCN. The circularity of circ_0005564 was verified. Our results showed that knockdown of circ_0005564 inhibited osteoblast differentiation in BMSCs. Taken together, our study demonstrates that circ_0005564 is a potential positive regulator of osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. © 2021 The Author(s).

A vast amount of primary resources is spent during the construction of buildings, which uses 50% of raw materials taken from earth. The energy needed to heat, cool, illuminate, connect the fabric of the built environment contributes 36% to global energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions. At the same time, the building industry is one of the most fragmented, decen-tralized and diverse industries with nearly 3 million workers organized in 800.000 predominantly small enterprises. The vast spectrum of trades and sub-domains along with the diversity of its products ranging from residential buildings to tun-nels and bridges leads to a wide spectrum of information exchanged in temporary processes with fragile value chains. At the same time, the building sector as a whole is trailing in many productivity indices and in its state of digitalization. The potential to save energy and to contribute to the reduction of the car-bon footprint from the sector can be approached from a number of different angles: Improved design and planning for the few new and the many existing buildings; re-use and circular economy for the materials involved and synergetic effects through increased vertical and horizontal integration of processes, and subsystems. All this requires the integration of knowledge domains. 1.2 Semantic DTs in the Built Environment The individual cyberphysical sub-systems that comprise the built environment from individual buildings to vast and highly connected infrastructure networks including traffic, energy, water and waste networks, are designed, operated and maintained in completely separated, heterogeneous information silos with a very low rate of digitalization. Representing, monitoring, simulating and optimizing even of single nodes in these interconnected, multi-layered networks using dig-ital twins has only just begun. Within a single domain of these networks such as an individual building, a road-network or bridge, the current and past sys-tem states, their long-term monitoring and improvement requires comprehensive semantic models digital twin models. Such models are still in their infancy. Cur-rent and evolving information models are still mostly designed to capture static as-planned individual lifecycle stages, have bespoke and disparate insular solu-tions and little to no vertical and horizontal connectivity with other nodes in the network. Information exchange models for different aspects at various levels of granularity from geospatial superstructures (GIS) to building components (BIM) often have hundreds or even thousands of semantic entities and the sheer size of the structured vocabularies to describe products range in the tens of thousands of concepts which often differ on national or even regional levels. 1.3 Use cases and examples In the presentation an overview of ongoing research, development and standard-ization efforts regarding the creation, integration and interoperability of seman-tic Digital Twins for the built environment is provided. Concrete challenges and solution approaches of past and ongoing research from different use cases and application domains of Semantic Digital Twins for-the assessment and energy refurbishing of residential buildings-monitoring and predictive maintenance of bridges-road network interoperability with Linked Data across European borders are used to illustrate these challenges. These include the semantic lifting of legacy data models, the alignment and integration of vast domain vocabularies, multi-modal integration of heterogeneous status information (sensor, images, measure-ments) and ongoing efforts to create reference frameworks for semantically rich Digital Twins in the built environment.

In particular, I argue that neither of the recently identified regress or circularity problems are troublesome for the supporter of easy ontology if they adopt a holistic account of application conditions. This is not intended to be a defence of easy ontology from all possible objections, but rather to compare holistic and non-holistic versions of the view. This discussion is also significant in that it serves to highlight two distinct forms of easy ontology, which, I argue, need to be distinguished when assessing the merits of the easy approach in future work. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107610108

We highlight the need to recognize that any investigation, particularly one into language, is always a concretely situated and self-grounding activity; our attitude as researchers is one of knowing as engagement with our subject matter. Our task, formulating the missing categories that can bridge embodied cognitive science with language research, requires avoiding premature abstractions and clarifying the multiple circularities at play. Our chosen method is dialectical, which has prompted several interesting observations that we respond to, particularly with respect to what this method means for enactive epistemology and ontology. We also clarify the important question of how best to conceive of the variety of social skills we progressively identify with our method and are at play in human languaging. Are these skills socially constituted or just socially learned? The difference, again, leads to a clarification that acts, skills, actors, and interactions are to be conceived as co-emerging categories. We illustrate some of these points with a discussion of an example of aspects of the model at play in a study of gift giving in China. © 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

However, there are challenges and barriers that are keeping businesses from this transition despite the benefits. One of such challenge is uncertainty regarding the residual value of used products which often lead to incentives misalignment among others. While research efforts are being made to proffer solutions by proposing circular business models, the question of how reliable the new models are remains unanswered. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model of domain experts and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for evaluating and validating CE Business Model (CEBM) ontology.

Moreover, I note how Searle fails to observe language in reciprocal relation to the institutions which not only are shaped by it but also shape language’s practical applications. According to Searle, social theorists that tried to show a connection between society, culture, and language all failed to see the constitutive role of language in the making of social reality. Consequently, I believe that Searle is himself guilty of a certain kind of blind presumption, and argue that Hegel’s philosophy of culture, which Searle dismisses as implausible, offers a more cohesive account of the normative transactions between human beings and their social world. © 2020 IJSCL.

Linked to the circularity of economic processes, it combines the promise of (regional) economic development with a sustainable, bio-based transition focused on increased and novel utilisation of aquatic resources. Nonetheless, portrayed as a holistic approach, the political visions of blue bioeconomy reside predominantly in marine environments with little integration of freshwater perspectives or alternative development paths. Rooted in concepts of policy mobility, assembling processes and the positionalities of involved entities, this paper displays two regionally embedded blue bioeconomy developments – Norwegian coastal seaweed farming and Finnish lake fisheries – and their spatially diverse reconnections with national and international policy narratives. By framing a freshwater and a coastal marine case, and their spatial reconnections with an overarching yet diversely translated policy realm, the paper taps into the multiple ontologies of water in blue bioeconomy governance and presents initial empirical and methodological steps towards a relational understanding of its governance processes. Based on four key topical reconnections, the article points to a variety of challenging mismatches between policy narratives, local development processes and potentials. It also suggests conceptual and methodological implications of this approach for further research into “blue” resource governance. © The Author(s) 2020.","Blue bioeconomy; policy mobility; positionality; seaweed; small-scale fisheries","European Union; fishery economics; fishery management; fishery policy; governance approach; resource management; seaweed; small scale industry; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086726794

To ensure smooth functioning, businesses need to adhere to a set of guidelines and constraints which are efficiently represented by Business Rules(BRs). Due to the large number of inter-dependent BRs, anomalies such as inconsistencies, redundancies and circularities creep in to the rule base, which if not dealt with properly can cause the business to function improperly causing significant damage at multiple levels. Present state of the art methods identify such anomalies in BRs by converting the rules to knowledge representation (Ontology, SMT-LIBv2, etc.) and then running them on solvers. These approaches suffer from certain drawbacks, namely incomplete mappings and scalability of solvers. To overcome these shortcomings, in this paper we propose to represent the Business Rules(BRs) as Decision Diagrams (BDD, SDD, MDD, etc.) and use graph algorithms on top of their canonical representations to identify anomalies. Presently, business rules and processes are treated separately. We model rules as Decision Diagrams(DDs) to integrate with certain graphical representations of business processes (e.g., DCR Graphs, BPMN, etc.), enabling us to efficiently analyze a much more enriched set of business information. We show an initial set of mappings from business rules to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD's), integrate with processes, identify various anomalies and outline our vision and prospective reach of this ap. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Bdd; Business rules; Decision diagrams; Mdd; Ontology; Processes; Sbvr; Sdd; Smt; Test case","Boolean functions; Graph algorithms; Knowledge representation; Mapping; Ontology; Processing; Software engineering; Surface mount technology; Business information; Business rules; Canonical representations; Decision diagram; Graphical representations; Sbvr; State-of-the-art methods; Test case; Binary decision diagrams",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082726460

Here we attempt to situate dialectical thinking as a constructive meta-mediation of this opposition between deconstruction and metalanguage. Dialectical thinking offers us a way to think about the processual nature of reason itself as a force of thought mediating being. In this mode of understanding, we attempt to think the possibility of articulating the meaning and importance of ‘metaontology’ defined as the ontology of epistemology. In a metaontology, we treat the structure of concepts not as reflecting external territory (map is a territory), nor as existing at a distance from external territory (map is not the territory), but as having their own territory (geometry) (i.e. maps as territory). We attempt to approach metaontology by reflectively observing the singularity of the author’s own internal territorial map, revealing a ‘quadratic twisted circularity’; and also the movement of the symbolic order itself, revealing a possible invariant unsymbolizable real. From these reflections we dive into the foundations of dialectical thinking, starting with Plato, and then exploring modifications introduced by Hegel and Lacan. Finally, we offer a dialectical structure of knowledge for the twenty-first century.

Recent relational ontological shifts, evident in both secular and theological anthropology, risks unfortunate consequences. Like a snake eating its own tail, without proper circumspection, relational ontology is in danger of postulating a problematic circularity of persons creating persons out of nothing. This article explores these recent shifts, the possible pitfalls of relational ontology, and proposes certain theological desiderata. © Koninklijke Brill NV, leiden, 2020.","Human rights; Personhood; Relational ontology; Theological anthropology; Theological ethics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098087619

However, the practice of creating good definitions is not a trivial task, and the literature does not provide clear methodologies. This article aims to present a method, we called OntoDef, to establish principles for systematizing the process of creating standardized definitions, which can be capable to provide the expected communication between the medical information systems and, therefore, to foster better services for citizens. The creation and testing of such method was conducted in the field of leukemias in the scope of the Blood Ontology project. The results show that definitions of biomedical entities are defined in a variety of criteria, which do not always meet the ontological representation requirements for adequate communication between medical information systems. Some well-known issues already identified are the identification of essential features of an entity, in addition to involve circularity, intangibility as well as the complexity in diagnosing manifold diseases such leukemias. We hope this experience can contribute to improvements in research projects in which Information Science supports Medicine and Healthcare with the aim of providing a better service to the citizen. © 2020 Universidade Estadual de Campinas.

The ontology is instantiated, giving the possibility to generate and assess a list of transformation processes alternatives, according to the potentially available waste streams and resource requirements in a specific area and/or sector. The resulting list is then analyzed and classified according to pre-established parameters, thus presenting which are the potentially best alternatives to close the material loops and recover chemical resources from available waste.

Products and services are developed faster, hold a shorter shelf-life disrupted by new offerings, and exist within global challenges such as climate change and sustainability. We live in the Anthropocene Era with human-induced Climate Change and the sixth mass extinction. Design challenges for product/service creation are shifting from a paradigm of customer-centric focus linear system to a new paradigm that includes a broader planetary context with a circular economy. The Human-Centered Design Thinking process popularized by IDEO/Stanford d.school identifies human-centered design opportunities for products and services through five steps: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. Unfortunately, a mere customer-centric view of product or service is insufficient for planetary-scale challenges requiring a broader focus that includes all life forms and the planet’s health. Thus, moving forward, design for the 21st century requires broader perspectives; design educators are challenged to overcome the limitations of Human-Centered Design Thinking. The point of this paper is that Human-Centered Design Thinking needs to be used in conjunction with new design methods that take into account the larger planetary context over time. In this paper, I discuss how futures thinking methods can augment design thinking methods to overcome limiting human-centered worldviews, epistemologies, and ontologies. In particular, how Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) can augment designers’ creative responses to behavior change challenges such as rapid-decarbonization through four layers (e.g., litany, systems, worldview, myths/metaphors). We provide a case study on CLA from design courses taught to both undergraduate and graduate design students. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Case study; Causal Layered Analysis; Design pedagogy; Design Thinking; Dexign Futures; Futures thinking","Climate change; Curricula; Human computer interaction; Linear systems; Students; User experience; Behavior change; Circular economy; Customer-centric; Design challenges; Design thinking; Global challenges; Human-centered designs; Products and services; Product design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088741693

However, in order to increase the economic viability of the obtained microalgae biomass from a production plant coupled to a coal power plant, a proteomic approach was initiated by using fresh and atomized microalgae samples, as the main used commercial forms. Above 51,000 high quality spectra were obtained per sample in the MS/MS analysis of whole proteome of N. gaditana, yielding above 7,500 peptides, leading the identification of 1,950 proteins, from the N. gaditana protein database, where 655 proteins were presented in all the replicates. The identified proteins were categorized according to gene ontology classification by molecular function and biological process. In this study, it has been described the first proteomic analysis of the microalgae N. gaditana under industrial conditions containing an important number of identified proteins. A significative presence of proteins with a potential role in different agri-food and biomedical applications was detected and studied being the core of future N. gaditana research to expand the current biotechnological applications of this microalga. Significance of the study: Three quarters of the planet earth correspond to seas and oceans, however its potential biotechnological use is still unknown. We described the first proteomic description of the microalgae N. gaditana under industrial conditions. Following the spirit of the EU initiatives of blue growth and the statements of circular economy, CO 2 waste from a coal plant power has been transformed in a resource for microalgae biomass production, common product presentations were evaluated by proteomic, and its potential use of identified proteins in Agri-food and Biomedicine has been revealed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Microalgae; N. gaditana; Non-model organisms; Proteomics","peptide; proteome; peptide; proteome; Article; biomass production; classification; economic aspect; gene ontology; microbial biomass; Nannochloropsis gaditana; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein database; protein function; proteomics; tandem mass spectrometry; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microalga; protein database; stramenopile; Databases, Protein; Microalgae; Peptides; Proteome; Proteomics; Stramenopiles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056202393

The main philosophical positions I will discuss are Husserl's phenomenology of the ego in his later transcendental phase, the Heideggerean view of the nature of Dasein, and Sartre's approach of the Being-for-itself as mainly exposed in Being and Nothingness. The central idea defended throughout this article is that self-constituting temporality as immanently induced may serve as a common foundation of the nature of the transcendental ego both in the Husserlian phenomenology and in the Heideggerean and Sartrean alternative positions; further, I will hold that, as consequence, the ultimate question about the possibility of an ontology of the pure ego is transposed to the question of the origin and foundation of inner temporality. Yet, in this case one is set to face anew the circularity of an infinite regression in terms of reflecting-reflected and the inevitability of the subjective character of the origin of temporality. Besides this key question - a primary issue of this article - I will address the issue of the convergences and diff erences regarding aspects of the essential nature of the Husserlian ego, the Heideggerean Dasein, and the Sartrean Being-for-itself, especially regarding the widely debated topic of the 'exteriority' of the latter two 'egological' concepts with regard to the world in contrast to the 'interiority' of the Husserlian absolute ego. © STATHIS LIVADAS, 2019.","Absolute flux of consciousness; Being-for-itself; Being-in-itself; Dasein; Ecstatic; Infinite regression; Temporal unity; Transcendental ego","Absolute flux of consciousness; Being-for-itself; Being-in-itself; Dasein; Ecstatic; Infinite regression; Temporal unity; Transcendental ego; Philosophical aspects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079142306

In comparison to green-field construction projects, adaptive reuse projects require distinct stages, definition of interfaces, decision gates, and planning methods in order to secure the success of the building project. Unfortunately, little research has been done regarding establishing feasible systems for the planning, assessment, and management of adaptive reuse projects, leading to underperforming building projects outcomes. Interface management (IM) can improve renovation projects outcomes by defining appropriate ways to identify, record, monitor, and track project interfaces. IM has the potential of bringing cost and time benefits during adaptive reuse projects execution. The aim of this study is to develop a reference framework for implementing IM for adaptive reuse projects. First, the inefficiencies of redevelopment projects are explained inside of a circular economy (CE) context. Second, an ontology of IM for adaptive reuse projects is defined based on the current barriers to adaptive reuse and the most common interface problems in construction projects. Third, the defined ontology is expanded through a case study by showing examples of adaptive reuse barriers on a case project, and how IM could have been part of the solution for these problems. Finally, this study concludes with the suggestions on interface management systems (IMS) implementation for future adaptive reuse projects. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptive reuse of buildings; Barriers in adaptive reuse projects; Circular economy; Interface management system; Interface problems in construction projects",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071694534

Five steps describe the framework: the definition of the goal and the scope, the extraction of the relevant information from heterogeneous data source feeding ontologies, the life cycle inventory, the impact calculation assessment and the results ranking. A case study related to agricultural by-product valorization, in the biorefinery area, allows to validate the approach and the associated framework.

It suggests building material passports as a data source for the materials to be circulated and then integrates them by means of Linked Data.A common language is proposed to combine and re-use the material data in the CE with the creation of two ontologies: Circular Exchange Ontology (CEO) and the Circular Materials and Activities Ontology (CAMO). The ontologies annotate materials under a CE classification scheme and describe the elements required for material exchange to occur: actors, the activities they perform and the referents of these activities (resources, products, tools and waste).An evaluation of the ontologies is made by means of use case-driven SPARQL queries. Further, a wide-scale evaluation addresses how a decentralized data ecosystem can enable users to publish information and dynamically interact with different repositories to exchange materials. Results indicate that these ontologies can foster a circulation medium between diverse construction industry resources.

I argue that history gives us an exemplary form of a chiastic relation and that Merleau-Ponty presages his later ontology of flesh when he investigates the paradox of thinking history. In brief, the paradox is this: history takes on significance only in light of a given reflection on it (just as the world is disclosed only by means of a given body). At the same time, ""the given reflection"" is overlaid and shot through with historical meaning and is nothing but the result of a historical inheritance (just as the body is bound up with the world and is nothing apart from it). I claim that, for Merleau-Ponty, to think history is to think that which is external to oneself and that which one is, in a deferred simultaneity or ""circularity"" that can be called chiastic. © 2018.

However, the pathological mechanism underlying I/R injury is still not clear. Recent works showed that circular RNAs play critical roles in many human diseases. In this study, the occurrence of liver I/R injury was validated by an analysis of the blood samples and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of liver tissues. Total RNA was purified and followed by RNA-seq in the purpose of screening the circRNAs in significant differentially expression, which were validated by quantitative PCR. GO and KEGG analysis were performed to determine the function of these differentially expressed circular RNAs. The circular structure of the circRNA was validated with gel electrophoresis and RNase R treatment. We found that some circular RNAs were differentially expressed in Liver I/R mouse models through bioinformatics analysis. These circular RNAs play roles in biological process, cellular component, and molecular function through GO analysis. Meanwhile, Hippo signaling pathway was found to be correlated with circular RNAs function in I/R models by KEGG analysis. To further validate bioinformatics data, two up-regulated and three down-regulated circular RNAs were confirmed in I/R models.

From the biological perspective however, industrial systems are generally inefficient. Manufacturing systems from the biological perspective therefore require the incorporation of tools to support decision making, thereby enabling organizations to improve their functions and competitiveness in a global and integrated perspective. Accordingly, at meso level, eco-industrial parks are gaining importance as an approach towards ensuring CE. In this work, an ontological framework for CE, based on industrial metabolism, is developed as the technology for information and knowledge models to share the circularity of resources through industrial ecosystems, based on ecological, economic, and social criteria. The ontology developed is modelled using Ontology Web Language and integrated in an architecture based on bio-inspired Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Moreover, a quantitative method, Ecological Network Analysis, is incorporated into MAS knowledge to analyze and establish relationships and metabolic pathways between companies, which can increase the circularity of technical nutrients and reduce biological nutrient extraction. The integrated model is applied to a case study on the product life cycle for the establishment of its metabolic pathway through an eco-industrial park. The subsequent incorporation of MAS thereby establishes the Smart Eco-Industrial Park. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Ecological network analysis; Industrial metabolism; Multi-Agent system; Ontology; Sustainable manufacturing","Decision making; Ecosystems; Life cycle; Manufacture; Metabolism; Multi agent systems; Nutrients; Ontology; Physiology; Circular economy; Ecological network analysis; Industrial ecosystems; Industrial metabolism; Natural environments; Ontological frameworks; Ontology web language; Sustainable manufacturing; Industrial economics; environmental economics; manufacturing; nature conservation; network analysis; organizational framework; sustainability; Article; eco industrial park; economic aspect; economic model; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; life cycle assessment; quantitative analysis; recreational park; resource management; social aspect; technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029209987

I focus on the relation between transcendental and metaphysical deductions in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, and on the problem of “epistemic foundationalism” and categoriality in Husserl’s Sixth Logical Investigation. I propose that the strategy of circularity is manifested through the peculiar self-enclosure of the categories of transcendental deduction vis-à-vis metaphysical deduction (Kant) and categorial intuition vis-à-vis sensuous intuition (Husserl). Although it is usually regarded as a deficient and damaging occurrence in argumentation, circularity appears to be a crucial component in the analysis of both thinkers. The analytical realms recognized by both these thinkers, is acknowledged as continually dependent upon the self-evidential “contingency” of the realms they are supposed to hierarchically overarch. The strict separation between the transcendental and phenomenological realms and their addressees appears to be founded on mutual circularity, where the relation between investigator and investigated extends beyond their separation and reconciliation. Both Kant and Husserl, through the circular relationship with empiricism-rationalism and psychologism radically re-articulated the logic-ontology and founding-founded polarities. © VEDRAN GRAHOVAC, 2018.","Categorial intuition; Categoriality; Circularity; Husserl; Kant; Metaphysical deduction; Transcendental deduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052026703

This combinatory approach argues for reflexivity as an epistemic criterion of ontological coherence, which suggests that social ontologies should account for the possibility of self-reflective subjectivity – for otherwise they result in a paradoxical conclusion according to which a social scientist reflects on her or his ontological commitments even though these commitments deny her or him the capacity for self-reflection. This analysis presupposes that all human sciences are categorically premised on social ontologies; and it argues for an analytical distinction between self-reflection, which refers to the agential capacity for reflecting on one’s own commitments, and the epistemic criterion of reflexivity hereby proposed.

This research focuses on how an ontology can be materialized as monumental architecture by presenting a case study of the Belle Glade archaeological culture, located in the Kissimmee-Okeechobee-Everglades (KOE) watershed of southern Florida. I argue that Belle Glade monumental architecture is the materialization of three principles-relatedness, circularity, and place-centeredness-exhibited in Native American ontologies. These principles are embodied in the form of the monuments, which invoke citations to the relatedness between the earth, sky, and water through their emplacement in flowing water, alignments to celestial events, and alignments to other places on the landscape. © 2017 by The University of New Mexico.

Then the extracted features are normalized and employed for multi-class support vector machine either for learning or retrieving processes. The retrieving process relies on three main tasks which namely Query Engine, Matching Module and Ontology Manger, respectively. Query Engine is to build the input text or image query using SPARQL language. The matching module extracts the shape and geometric features of image’s objects and employ them to Ontology Manger which in turn inserts them in ontology knowledge base.

If we apply this conception to Husserl's example of two mutually-touching hands of one body we must then state not that we perceive here a coincidence of certain subjective sensations with certain objective qualities, but rather that my body, in the sense of an object, results from a restructuralisation of the whole field of the body accomplished by the body as the performer of perceptual intentions. The body-object, and for the same reasons also the body-subject, is therefore the product of the analysis of the body in the sense of a field of structuralisation or polarisation, not its original phenomenological ""stratum"", as in Husserl. If the body grasps itself as perceptible only by a change of its own structure, inasmuch as it is a certain field of structuralisation, then an ""external"" thing, which is likewise a pole of such grasping, must belong to the same ontological ""field"" as the body. Merleau-Ponty's ""flesh"", that is the circularity between questioning of perception and answering of the perceived, is thus a phenomenon taking place beyond the boundary of the body as a singular being. Tis fact allows the concept of flesh to be extended and to be understood as an ""element"", that is, as a dimension in which individual beings only appear.","Body (corps); Edmund Husserl; Flesh (chair); Maurice Merleau-Ponty; Ontology; Perception; Phenomenology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025134636

The inseparability of these two aspects of the body he calls flesh (chair). According to Husserl, I perceive my body such that in a certain perceived object I also understand sensations roused by the perception of that object -1 observe the ""consequential parallel"" between two series of objective and subjective phenomena. Husserl argues that the unity of the body should be expressed as a double unity, and the body as subject-object. In this article I analyse Husserl's example of two hands of the same body touching each other and, in agreement with Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, I attempt to show that the body can appear to itself as an object only on the basis of a differentiation of the body as of a certain field of perceiving.

While Althusser self-consciously undertook to defend the scientific character of Marxism and so permanently establish it on a firm footing, many of his closest followers eventually exited the Marxian paradigm for a post-structuralism post-Marxism. We will argue that this development was rooted in Althusser's initial procedure as he attempted to ground Marxism's scientificity in an epistemological argument whose main referent was Marxism itself. This initiated a circularity which was ultimately to prove fatal to Althusser's project. Less remarked upon, however, is a further legacy of the Althusserian oeuvre, the critical realist conception of Marxism initiated by Roy Bhaskar. Bhaskar found part of his inspiration in Althusser's successful posing of the question of Marx's science. On the one hand, Althusser's work can legitimately be seen as a bridge into the post-modern challenge to Marxism. On the other hand, it can be seen as clearing the ground and establishing some of the foundation for critical realism's successful recuperation of the scientific character of Marxism. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Epistemology; Ideology; Marxism; Ontology; Philosophy; Science",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84918822481

The thesis defended in this paper is that knowledge of these axioms may be gained by recourse to judgments of probability. While considerations of probability have come to the forefront in recent epistemology, it seems safe to say that the thesis defended here is heterodox from the vantage point of traditional philosophy of mathematics. So this paper focuses on providing a preliminary defense of this thesis, in that it focuses on responding to several objections. Some of these objections are from the classical literature, such as Frege's concern about indiscernibility and circularity (Section 2.1), while other are more recent, such as Baker's concern about the unreliability of small samplings in the setting of arithmetic (Section 2.2). Another family of objections suggests that we simply do not have access to probability assignments in the setting of arithmetic, either due to issues related to the ω-rule (Section 3.1) or to the non-computability and non-continuity of probability assignments (Section 3.2). Articulating these objections and the responses to them involves developing some non-trivial results on probability assignments (Appendix A-Appendix C), such as a forcing argument to establish the existence of continuous probability assignments that may be computably approximated (Theorem 4 Appendix B). In the concluding section, two problems for future work are discussed: developing the source of arithmetical confirmation and responding to the probabilistic liar. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Inductive logic; Peano arithmetic; Philosophy of mathematics","Ontology; Indiscernibility; Inductive logic; Natural number; Non-trivial; Peano arithmetic; Philosophy of mathematics; Probability assignment; Small sampling; Probability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904052809

This book takes up this perennial question, defending the view that philosophy consists of conceptual analysis, construed broadly. Conceptual analysis is understood to involve the search for de re essences, but the book takes up various challenges to this meta-philosophy: that some concepts are merely family resemblance concepts with no definition in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions (""game"", ""language""); that it is impossible to provide sufficient conditions for some philosophically important concepts without circularity (""knowledge"", ""intentional action""); that there exists an unsolved paradox of analysis; that there is no well-defined analytic-synthetic distinction; that names have no definition; and that conceptual analysis is not properly naturalistic. Ultimately, the text finds none of these objections convincing: analysis emerges as both possible and fruitful. At the same time, it rejects the idea of the ""linguistic turn"", arguing that analysis is not directed to language as such, but at reality. Going on to distinguish several types of analysis, with an emphasis on classical decompositional analysis, this book shows different philosophical traditions to be engaged in conceptual analysis when properly understood. Philosophical activity has the kind of value possessed by play, the text claims, which differs from the kind of value possessed by scientific activity. The book concludes with an analytic discussion of the prospects for traditional ontology and the nature of instantiation. © 2012 Oxford University Press.

Different automatic or semiautomatic extraction techniques have been proposed for building domain ontology in recent years. The correctness of the extracted ontology, however, has often been ignored or not verified formally. With increasingly complex and sophisticated realworld domains, the issue of correctness and verification of ontology is becoming more important. This chapter proposes a formal technique for ontology representation and its verification, based on State Controlled Coloured Petri Net (SCCPN), which is a high level net combining Coloured Petri Net and State Controlled Petri Net. It provides the capability of detection and identification of potential anomalies in ontology. We first describe the formal representation of ontology by SCCPN. The definition of SCCPN for modeling ontologies and the mapping between them are presented in detail. Moreover, the ontology inference in SCCPN is also formulated with specified inference mechanisms. After modeling ontology by SCCPN, the formal verification of potential anomalies (including redundancy, circularity and contradiction) is discussed. It is based on the reachable markings generated by transition firings in the Petri nets. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

Krakowska 71-79, 71-004 Szczecin, Poland","In the paper I consider the prospects of interpreting late Carnap views on ontology as being in part a sort of epistemism. More precisely, I argue that the theses that he maintained in the Empirism, Semantics, and Onotology and the volume of The Library of Living Philosophers devoted to his philosophy put him close to proponents of epistemicism, according to which ontological debates over truth-values of metaphysical theses need not to be verbal disputes, but the prospects of resolving them are meager, since there are no evidences that could support either given metaphysical thesis or its negation. Most likely, Carnap should be read as a proponent of a more radical version of this view, since he maintained that in principle there are no such evidences. I find this view fit well with Carnap's argumentative strategy against substantial character of metaphysical debates, since he stresses the lack of evidences in favour of or against metaphysical claims as the main reason for his deflationism in ontology. However, what is the most worrisome in taking this route of interpreting late Carnap views on ontology is that among the presuppositions of epistemicism is the thesis that one can make sense of the talk about truth-values of metaphysical claims, whereas Carnap maintained they lack truth-values due to lack of cognitive contents. But taking the change of his view on the nature of semantic values in the volume of The Library of Living Philosophers devoted to his philosophy, where he claimed that extralinguistic entities should serve a role of semantic values and the notion of truth should be defined relatively to a given interpretation in a given model, I find his opinion on metaphysical claims unjustified, since one can define the the notion of truth for these claims relatively to models and hence make a talk about their truth values (relatively to models) sensible. It doesn't follow from that that one can also make a sense of a claim being absolutely true, since it would require to take one model to be special one in the sense that it fits the way reality is, which is something that the proponent of epistemicism deny on the ground that there are no evidences that could be taken to show that one of the models of a given language is special in this respect. I also discuss applications of the inference to the best explanation in argumentation in favour of various sorts of realism and argue that this kind of argumentation always leaves room for some ontological dispute between parties from which one deny the existence of entities that the other argued for through application of the inference to the best explanation and hence that no metaphysical debate can be resolved by application of the inference to the best explanation under the threat of circularity. The paper is the continuation of considerations made in my paper The Later Carnap and Contemporary Metaphysical Debates. Part I, in which I've argued that one can treat Carnap to be also a proponent of fictionalism. In effect, Carnap's deflationism in ontology seems to be a combination of fictionalism and epistemicism.","Carnap; Deflationism; Epistemicism; Fictionalism; Metaontology; Ontology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872070479

These conditions make constructive connections between Creole studies, historical linguistics and language-acquisition research. Here 'Cartesian' has a mentalist sense, as in Chomsky (1966): I consider the formation of so-called 'Creole' languages to be ultimately reducible to the creation, in certain sociohistorical contexts, of certain idiolects (i.e., individual internal, or 'I-', languages) in the minds of the 'first ""Creole"" speakers'. To avoid circularity, my use of the term 'Creole' in the phrase 'first ""Creole"" speakers' combines some of its original ethno-historical senses: I use the word 'Creole', in this particular context, to refer to the non-indigenous people of African or European descent that were born and raised in the colonial New World, in opposition to those that were born and raised in the Old Worlds of Africa and Europe. The term 'Uniformitarian' evokes Neogrammarian approaches to language change, as advocated, for example, by Osthoff and Brugmann (1878) and Paul (1890). It summarizes my fundamental working assumption that no sui generis or exceptional linguistic processes need to be postulated in order to explain the creation of these languages that have come to be labeled 'Creole': these languages were created by the same psycholinguistic mechanisms that are responsible for the creation of (I-)languages, and for linguistic diachronic patterns, everywhere else. Therefore, 'Creole' languages cannot be distinguished a priori from non-'Creole' languages on any linguistic-theoretical criteria - and 'Creole' languages can be genetically classified by the Comparative Method, on a par with non-'Creole' languages. Such assumptions go against popular claims about Creole genesis such as those in, for example, Thomason and Kaufman (1988), Lefebvre (1998) and Bickerton (1999). In establishing these Cartesian-Uniformitarian guidelines, I correct category mistakes that fail to distinguish explanations that apply to I-languages from explanations that apply to E(xternal)-languages and other social-group phenomena that I-languages are implicated in. One such category mistake concerns the ontology and time course of innovations in specific I-languages vs. their spread across populations of I-languages and into E-language communal norms. Then I investigate the possible - and impossible - contributions of first-language acquisition and second-language acquisition to 'creolization'. In particular, I take my cues from: (i) studies of language- and dialect-contact situations where children and adults seem to play observably distinct roles; and (ii) recent discoveries about instances of Sign Language acquisition and creation where the Primary Linguistic Data seem remarkably restricted. As for elucidating the limits on the restructuring capacities of children and adults, and their respective contributions to language creation and change, it is epistemologically safer to investigate instances of diachronic development that are more recent than the now unobservable early stages of 'creolization'. Throughout this essay, I use the term 'creolization' strictly as an a-theoretical abbreviation for the longer phrase 'development of these languages that, for sociohistorical reasons, have been labeled ""Creole"" '. In the perspective sketched here, creolization is just another instance of language change - or 'language evolution', in Mufwene's (2001, 2008) sense - the investigation of which is to shed light on Universal Grammar. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73649112051

However, it is still unclear which is the best approach to semantic similarity in this context, since there is no conclusive evaluation of the various measures. Another issue, is whether electronic annotations should or not be used in semantic similarity calculations. Results: We conducted a systematic evaluation of GO-based semantic similarity measures using the relationship with sequence similarity as a means to quantify their performance, and assessed the influence of electronic annotations by testing the measures in the presence and absence of these annotations. We verified that the relationship between semantic and sequence similarity is not linear, but can be well approximated by a rescaled Normal cumulative distribution function. Given that the majority of the semantic similarity measures capture an identical behaviour, but differ in resolution, we used the latter as the main criterion of evaluation. Conclusions: This work has provided a basis for the comparison of several semantic similarity measures, and can aid researchers in choosing the most adequate measure for their work. We have found that the hybrid simGIC was the measure with the best overall performance, followed by Resnik's measure using a best-match average combination approach. We have also found that the average and maximum combination approaches are problematic since both are inherently influenced by the number of terms being combined. We suspect that there may be a direct influence of data circularity in the behaviour of the results including electronic annotations, as a result of functional inference from sequence similarity. © 2008 Pesquita et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Combination approaches; Electronic annotations; Gene ontology terms; Normal cumulative distribution function; Semantic similarity; Semantic similarity measures; Sequence similarity; Systematic evaluation; Semantics; article; computer program; controlled study; data analysis; genetic analysis; genetic similarity; information processing; intermethod comparison; molecular biology; quantitative analysis; sequence homology; system analysis; algorithm; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biology; classification; gene expression profiling; genetics; linguistics; methodology; normal distribution; protein database; reference value; semantics; sensitivity and specificity; sequence homology; standard; statistics; structure activity relation; ultrastructure; protein; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Expression Profiling; Normal Distribution; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Proteins; Reference Standards; Reference Values; Semantics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sequence Homology; Structure-Activity Relationship; Vocabulary, Controlled",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47149083877

This involves the formal semantics of these languages which is typically based on a limited set of abstract mathematical notions. In this paper, we discuss the interplay between formal semantics and the intended role of ontologies as semantic foundation. In this connection a circularity is identified if ontologies are to determine the conceptual equivalence of expressions. This is particularly relevant for ontologies which are to be provided in multiple formalisms. In order to overcome this situation, ontological semantics is generally defined as a novel kind of semantics which is purely and directly based on ontological entities. We sketch a specific application of this semantics to the syntax of first order logic. In order to beneficially rely on theoretical results and reasoning systems, an approximation of the proposed semantics in terms of the conventional approach is established. This results in a formalization method for first order logic and a translation-based variant of ontological semantics. Both variants involve an ontology for their application. In the context of developing a top-level ontology, we outline an ontology which serves as a meta-ontology in applying ontological semantics to the formalization of ontologies. Finally, resolved and remaining issues as well as related approaches are briefly discussed. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

We investigate the LbL formation of multilayer films composed of polymers of biological origin (poly(l-lysine) (PLL) and dextran sulfate (DS)), the adsorption of fibronectin (Fn)-a matrix protein known to promote cell adhesion-onto these films, and the subsequent spreading behavior of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We employ optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) and quartz crystal microgravimetry with dissipation (QCMD) to characterize multilayer assembly in situ, and find adsorbed Fn mass on PLL-terminated films to exceed that on DS terminated films by 40%, correlating with the positive charge and lower degree of hydration of PLL terminated films. The extent and initial rate of Fn adsorption to both PLL and DS-terminated films exceed those onto the bare substrate, indicating the important role of electrostatic complexation between negatively charged protein and positively charged PLL at or near the film surface. We use phase-contrast optical microscopy to investigate the time-dependent morphological changes of HUVEC as a function of layer number, charge of terminal layer, and the presence of Fn. We observe HUVEC to attach, spread, and lose circularity on all surfaces. Positively charged PLL-terminated films exhibit a greater extent of cell spreading than do (negatively charged) DS-terminated films, and spreading is enhanced while circularity loss is suppressed by the presence of adsorbed Fn. The number of layers plays a significant role only for DS-terminated films with Fn, where spreading on a bilayer greatly exceeds that on a multilayer, and PLL-terminated films without Fn, where initial spreading is significantly higher on a monolayer. We observe initial cell spreading to be followed by retraction (i.e. decreased cell area and circularity with time) for films without Fn, and for DS-terminated films with Fn. Overall, the Fn-coated PLL monolayer and the Fn-coated PLL-terminated multilayer are the best performing films in promoting cell spreading. We conclude the presence of Fn to be an important factor (more so than film charge or layer number) in controlling the interaction between multilayer films and living cells, and thus to represent a promising strategy toward in vivo applications such as tissue engineering. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These ontologies are different from each others in the part of instances of classes and properties. A variety of methods can be used for the similarity of these ontologies. Basically they apply pair-wise comparison of entities from each of the ontologies and select the most similar pair. These entities include class, property, instance, data type and so on. However, this task can be restricted in the comparison of instances and relations. A similarity measure is introduced for the similarity of restricted ontologies, which makes use of the specialty of inference in ontology and is a 2-grade ontology similarity technique. Moreover, the 2-grade ontology similarity technique can resolve the problem of circularities in similarity definition.","Ontology retrieval; Ontology similarity; Restricted ontology; Semantic Web","Data mining; Semantics; World Wide Web; XML; Information index; Ontology retrieval; Ontology similarity; Restricted ontology; Semantic Web; Information retrieval",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746575089

The triangle suggests the circularity of the widespread view that math arises from the mind, the mind arises out of matter, and that matter can be explained in terms of math. Non-physicists should be wary of any claim that modern physics leads us to any particular resolution of this circularity, since even the sample of three theoretical physicists writing this paper hold three divergent views. Some physicists believe that current physics has already found the basic framework for a complete description of reality, and only has to fill in the details. Others suspect that no single framework, from physics or other sources, will ever capture reality. Yet others guess that reality might be approached arbitrarily closely by some form of future physics, but probably based on completely different frameworks. We will designate these three approaches as the fundamentalist, secular and mystic views of the world, as seen by practicing physicists. We present and contrast each of these views, which arguably form broad categories capturing most if not all interpretations of physics. We argue that this diversity in the physics community is more useful than an ontological monoculture, since it motivates physicists to tackle unsolved problems with a wide variety of approaches. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.","Consciousness; Mathematics; Ontology; Physics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646039691

Both deficiencies create problems in fields, such as laboratory medicine, which have to report results of all types of property, preferably in a unified systematic format. The present text aims at forming a domain ontology around ""property"", with intensional definitions and systematic terms, mainly using the terminological tools - with some additions - provided by the International Standards ISO 704, 1087-1, and 10241. ""System"" and ""component"" are defined, ""quantity"" is discussed, and the generic concept ""property"" is given as 'inherent state- or process-descriptive feature of a system including any pertinent components'. Previously, the term 'kind-of-quantity' and quasisynonyms have been used as primitives; the proposed definition of ""kind-of-property"" is 'common defining aspect of mutually comparable properties'. ""Examination procedure"", ""examination method"", ""examination principle"", and ""examination"" are defined, avoiding the term 'test'. The need to distinguish between instances of ""characteristic"", ""property"", ""type of characteristic"", ""kind-of- property"", and ""property value"" is emphasized; the latter is defined together with ""property value scale"". These fundamental concepts are presented in a diagram, and the effect of adding essential characteristics to give expanded definitions is exemplified. Substitution usually leads to unwieldy definitions, but reveals circularity as does exhaustive consecutive listing of defining concepts. The top concept 〈property〉 may be generically divided according to many terminological dimensions, especially regarding which operators are allowed among the four sets =, #; <, >; +, -; and x,:. The coordinate concepts defined are termed by the modifiers 'nominal', 'ordinal', 'differential', and 'rational' before '... property'. Other possibilities are given, based on the literature, especially the stepwise division into ""nominal property"" and ""quantity""; ""ordinal quantity"" and ""unitary quantity""; ""differential unitary quantity"" and ""rational unitary quantity"". As top concepts, 〈kind-of-property〉, 〈examination procedure〉, 〈examination〉, 〈property value〉, and 〈property value scale〉 are i.a. divided homologously to 〈property〉. The term 'observation' and the modifiers 'qualitative', 'semi-quantitative', and 'quantitative' are avoided. ""Metrological unit"" and ""system of metrological units"" are defined together with a number of specific concepts. Some problems with characteristics of ""SI unit"" are discussed and an alternative system shown. The conceptions of ""metrological dimension"" are outlined, leading to a definition and specific concepts. The generally accepted IUPAC/IFCC syntax for designations of instantiated properties is 'System (specification)- Component(specification); kind-of-property(specification)', and""dedicatedkind-of-property"" is defined as 'kind-of-property with given sort of system and any pertinent sorts of component'. The related systematic terms may be generated according to ENV 1614 using generative patterns from ENV 12264. The elements of the appellation and examination result of a singular rational property are diagrammed.

The exact methodological principles and systematic rules for a linkage between philosophical theories and neuroscientific hypothesis, however, remain to be clarified. The present contribution focuses on these principles, as well as on the relation between ontology and epistemology and the characterization of hypothesis in neurophilosophy. Principles of transdisciplinary methodology include the ‘principle of asymmetry’, the ‘principle of bi-directionality’ and the ‘principle of transdisciplinary circularity’. The ‘principle of asymmetry’ points to an asymmetric relationship between logical and natural conditions. The ‘principle of bi-directionality’ claims for the necessity of bi-directional linkage between natural and logical conditions. The ‘principle of transdisciplinary circularity’ describes systematic rules for mutual comparison and cross-conditional exchange between philosophical theory and neuroscientific hypotheses. The relation between ontology and epistemology no longer is determined by ontological presuppositions i.e. “ontological primacy”. Instead, there is correspondence between different ‘epistemological capacities’ and different kinds of ontology which consecutively results in “epistemic primacy” and “ontological pluralism”. The present contribution concludes by rejecting some so-called ‘standard-arguments’ including the ‘argument of circularity’, the ‘argument of categorical fallacy’, the ‘argument of validity’ and the ‘argument of necessity’. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This paper presents a brief summary of previous work done on evaluating ontologies and the criteria (consistency, completeness, conciseness, expandability, and sensitiveness) used to evaluate and to assess ontologies. It also addresses the possible types of errors made when domain knowledge is structured in taxonomies in an ontology and in knowledge bases: circularity errors, exhaustive and nonexhaustive class partition errors, redundancy errors, grammatical errors, semantic errors, and incompleteness errors. It also describes the process followed to evaluate the standard-units ontology already published at the Ontology Server.",,"Computational complexity; Computational linguistics; Computer programming languages; Errors; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge sharing; Ontology; Ontology server; Knowledge based systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0035278980
