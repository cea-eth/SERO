This study proposes a methodology based on a chain of tools to enable structural engineers to anticipate future reuse. This methodology describes the design of reversible assemblies, the addition of complementary information in the building information modeling (BIM), reinforced traceability, and the development of a material bank. At the same time, controlling the environmental impacts of reuse is planned by carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) at all stages of the project. Two scenarios for reuse design are applied with the toolchain proposed. A. ""design from a stock"" scenario, which leads to 100% of elements being reused, using only elements from stock. B. ""design with a stock"" scenario, which seeks to integrate as many reused elements available in the stock as possible. The case study of a high-rise building deconstructed to rebuild a medium-rise building demonstrated that the developed toolchain allowed the inclusion of all reuse elements in a new structural calculation model. © 2020 by the authors.",Building circular economy; Building information modeling (BIM); Design for reuse; Embodied energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Reuse of materials; Sustainable construction,bearing capacity; building construction; database; design method; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; loading test; structural analysis,Article,,,,,,

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables. Therefore, the authors suggest utilizing the approach developed in this research to promote the circularity of materials in different subsectors of the construction industry. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Building structure; Economic reusability; Gaussian process regression; K-nearest neighbors; Random forest; Supervised machine learning,Bearings (machine parts); Building components; Construction industry; Economic analysis; Predictive analytics; Probability; Reusability; Sensitivity analysis; Supervised learning; Wages; Building structural; Economic factors; Predictive modeling; Probability theory; Procurement process; Structural elements; Supervised machine learning; Visualization technique; Learning systems,Article,,,,,,

Adaptive reuse has the potential to maximize the residual utility and value of existing assets through green design methods such as selective disassembly planning. Studies in the field of selective disassembly are scarce and there is no evidence of established methodologies for the optimization of the environmental and financial benefits. A multi-objective analysis is key to obtaining several effective selective disassembly plans for the adaptive reuse of an existing asset through the combination of different deconstruction methods. The analysis is carried out in terms of the physical, environmental, and economic constraints of the deconstruction methods per building component. The Sequential Disassembly Planning for Buildings (SDPB) method is used in order to generate the optimized disassembly plans for retrieving target components. At the end, a weighted multi-objective optimization analysis is incorporated to generate the set of noninferior solutions that minimizes environmental impacts and building cost. The results show that different complete disassembly plans exist for all the possible combinations. The possible combinations are driven by the deconstruction methods per component, as well as the dismantling interdependence. The method described in this study can be used to improve the project outcomes according to specific goals and constraints (e.g. environmental, economic, technical).

A potential path to increase sustainability is to integrate circular economy principles in structural design, which advocate for prioritizing the reuse of structural materials to extend their service life, limiting their physical transformation to locational and functional changes. In this way, structural projects of the past can not only serve as an inspiration for the future, but the material itself can also be reappropriated.

Once the model is established, further benefits can be reaped, such as the analysis of complex technical correlations within the system. Various insights can be gained by displaying the model as a formal graph and querying it. To enable such queries, a graph schema is necessary, which allows to transfer the model into a graph database. In the course of this paper, we discuss the design of a graph schema and MBSE modeling approach, enabling deep going system analysis and anomaly resolution in complex embedded systems with a focus on testing and anomaly resolution. The schema and modeling approach are designed to answer questions such as What happens if there is an electrical short in a component? Which other components are now offline and which data cannot be gathered anymore? If a component becomes unresponsive, which alternative routes can be established to obtain data processed by it. We build on the use case of qualification and operations of a small spacecraft. Structural elements of the MBSE model are transferred to a graph database where analyses are conducted on the system.

Structural work and foundations represent the majority of the embodied energy of a building. The research effort is therefore focused on the structural elements. Reuse is here defined as the reuse of an element without transformation, unlike recycling which induces a new industrial cycle. It is therefore about reducing the consumption of materials and lowering GHG emissions. Today, it is impossible in France to reuse structures because of responsibilities, insurance and lack of traceability. How to make possible the reuse of structural components in order to reach a low carbon building? The challenge of this work is to find the best structural configuration making the components reuse easier at the EOL. The methodology we are implementing aims to design the structural elements by increasing the BIM parameters (6D, LCA), to attach the mechanical information, material durability, ageing to each object of the digital mock-up. A digital and physical traceability makes it possible to follow the evolution of the element over the years and to feed a database. At the end of its life the database is accessible and searchable for the design of a future building. A development of tools and gateways will then allow from a model of calculation to go to query the database to find an element resulting from the deconstruction that can be reused in the future structure. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Still little explored, the reuse of structural components over multiple service lives has the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of building structures. Structural design and construction based on reuse avoids sourcing new material, it reduces superfluous waste, and requires little energy. However, designing a structure from a stock of reclaimed elements entails a change of design paradigm: in contrast to conventional design practice, the structural geometry and topology depends on element stock characteristics, e.g. available cross sections and lengths. This paper presents discrete structural optimization formulations to design truss systems from stock elements. The approach taken in this work is iterative: 1) element assignment and topology optimization are carried out, and 2) geometry optimization follows thereafter to best-fit the system geometry to the length of assigned stock elements, for instance to reduce cut-off waste. Two case studies are presented: a) a cantilever of simple layout used to explain the details of the design methodology, and b) a train station roof structure of complex layout made from elements reused from disassembled electric pylons. For these case studies, Life Cycle Assessment confirms that an up to 63% environmental impact reduction is possible when comparing structures obtained with the proposed method against weight-optimized solutions made of new elements. © 2018 The Authors",Circular economy; Life-Cycle Assessment; Reuse; Structural optimization; Truss structures,,Article,,,,,,

By contrasting their building-specific features, it demonstrates the benefits and drawbacks of particular structural elements and envelope solutions and ecological aspects using various system boundaries of life-cycle assessment (LCA). Following a careful consideration of ecological factors and sustainable circular economy criteria, a structural component that is sustainably optimized is defined. This component should be chosen based on external conditions. By selecting environmentally friendly building materials and proper connecting procedures that enable separability, resource-efficient and sustainable buildings can be achieved. Both the selection of load-bearing elements and the necessary insulating material have a significant impact on the ecological performance and reusability options of the components. The elements of homogeneity, separability, and pollutantfreeness play a significant influence in the reuse process, namely in terms of details and construction type in general, as well as the ways of reusing and recycling them. Sustainable solutions for load-bearing building components can be created by simultaneously investigating environmentally friendly building materials and the structure of the components. This paper illustrates how the natural resources can be used both optimally and sustainably. It presents a conceptual framework for scenario development of the LCA of load-bearing structures, their effect on the design and decision-making process. There is a potential of increasing total resource efficiency at the building level with a suitable combination of the material components employed at the component level. Because of this, the overall energy efficiency and its consequent ecological impacts are the main topics of this study. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

First, a lower bound of structural material quantities is estimated for a typical steel frame structure in a low-rise office building. The embodied carbon of this conventional design is then compared with values collected from a series of similar existing steel buildings (deQo database) as benchmark. Various scenarios regarding the impact of selective deconstruction, transportation, and cross-section oversizing are modelled and parameterized. The study eventually computes carbon savings over one life cycle of the building project. Results show that reuse remains beneficial for long transport and high oversizing.

Compared to traditional constructions built from first-use material, a fictitious reuse of undamaged load-bearing components over three consecutive use cycles would reduce the global warming potential indicator by 25%.

The purpose of the current research was the assessment of the environmental impact caused by different end-of-life scenarios as can be applied to steel buildings. An existing residential steel building is used for the calculations, while the results allow for the comparison between the different end scenarios concerning the main structural materials used, namely the structural steel. Conclusions drawn include the formation of a clear perspective on the environmental impact benefits that can be achieved at the end of a steel buildings life cycle and the positive effects of the steel construction technology as applied to building projects in terms of environmental sustainability.

Reuse of structural elements made of concrete is of particular interest, given the large use of this material worldwide and its high environmental impact. Reusing constructive concrete elements is however challenging, particularly because connections between concrete structural elements are difficult to disassemble. It is then worth designing reuse techniques for concrete load-bearing elements and to verify their environmental performance using comprehensive methods such as Life Cycle Assessment. Based on the Design for Reuse concept, this article assesses the environmental impacts of a reusable structural portal frame constitutive of a concrete building and compares it to a traditional design with new materials. It relies on data collected through an experimental protocol of reinforced concrete structures construction/deconstruction/reconstruction using hydrodemolition. Impact scores are significantly reduced for all environmental categories after a first reuse cycle, both at the scale of a portal frame or a building. Concrete, and particularly high performance concrete, has durability qualities allowing to undergo several usage cycles. The effectiveness of environmental benefits however depends on functional downgrading and material losses. Guidance should then be provided to insure that future reuse practices will actually provide the expected benefits. This has to be conducted in parallel to full-scale experiments of load-bearing elements disassembly to estimate the realistic rates that can be obtained when deconstructing a building. © 2022",Buildings; Circular economy; Concrete structures; Deconstruction; Design for reuse; Life cycle assessment,Architectural design; Carbon footprint; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Construction industry; Ecodesign; Emission control; Environmental management; High performance concrete; Reinforced concrete; Buildings sector; Circular economy; Construction sectors; Deconstruction; Design for reuse; Load-bearing elements; Portal frame; Reuse; Reuse practices; Structural elements; Life cycle,Article,,,,,,

Reusing structural elements reduces the environmental impacts of building structures because it avoids sourcing new material, it reduces waste and it requires little energy. Designing structures from reused elements is unlike conventional structural design because stock element availability is a design input. In other words, structures must be designed to fit given element characteristics, e.g. cross-sections and lengths. Stock constraints such as number of elements and element lengths, have a major influence on the optimal structure layout and form. In this new paradigm structural form follows availability. This work formulates new computational methods for the synthesis of reticular structures through reuse. Two scenarios are presented: a) reuse of reclaimed elements from a given stock, and b) design of a common stock which is used as a kit-of-parts to build diverse structures. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methods. It is shown that structures produced by these methods have a significantly lower environmental impact than minimum weight structures made of new elements. Copyright © 2019 by S: GABRIELE, F.

This causes global warming and waste problems. The demand for the reuse of construction materials is increasing, although it is not the convention, to reduce the environmental impact. Although the sustainable effect of the reuse of materials has been proven in several studies, materials are not always reused in practice, owing to the lack of an information system for reusable materials and the economic uncertainty. In this study, we propose a framework for designing structures using reusable steel beams. The design framework consists of a material bank and a design support tool. The material bank provides information on reusable materials based on the building information modeling. The design support tool generates efficient material procurement plans and provides information about the environmental and economic impact of the project. In a case study used to verify the framework, CO2 emissions were reduced by up to 77% through material reuse, which was consistent with the results of previous studies. However, owing to the cost of processing reusable materials, the overall cost was found to increase by up to about 40%. Therefore, an economic analysis over the entire life cycle when using reusable materials needs to be done. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper addresses the approach of the reuse of steel structure without melting which allows for savings in steel mass and the reduction of waste amounts offering moreover an opportunity to avoid environmental burdens related to the recycling process. Recent studies have stressed the technical feasibility of this strategy, which appears particularly effective in those countries in which a building's life is rather short, such as in Japan and US, though its application encounters more difficulties in most European countries, owing to longer building use. Besides stressing the architectural and structural feasibility of the above-mentioned strategy, this research work aims to quantify the mass savings that are achievable in this manner by presenting a real case study set in Italy. It consists in a railway station, which has been designed keeping in mind the partial employment of structural elements recovered from an old industrial building that is no longer in use. To estimate the amount of steel saved, two different structural models for the designed building have been carried out and compared. In the first one, the structure has been designed on the assumption of the reusing of recovered structural elements; in the second one, the same structure has been designed considering the use of new elements only. The final result of the analysis shows that steel reuse allowed for savings of up to 30% of steel. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Continuous strain data was collected during the entire erecting process of the new building using a wireless sensor network to obtain novel information on construction-induced stresses. The collected data will be used to assess the magnitude of construction induced stresses.

It consumes more than half of the total global resources; it is responsible for more than a third of the total global energy use and associated emissions; and generates the greatest and most voluminous waste stream globally. Reuse is considered to be a material and carbon saving practice highly recommended in the construction sector as it can address both waste and carbon emission regulatory targets. This practice offers the possibility to conserve resources through the reclamation of structural components and the carbon embedded in them, as well as opportunities for the development of new business models and the creation of environmental, economic, technical and social value. This paper focuses on the identification and analysis of existing interventions that can promote the reuse of construction components, and outlines the barriers and opportunities arising from this practice as depicted from the global literature. The main conclusions that derive from this study are that the combination of incentives that promote reuse of construction components and recycling of the rest of the construction materials with the provision of specialised education, skills and training would transform the way construction sector currently operates and create opportunities for new business development. Moreover, a typology system developed based on the properties and lifetime of construction components is required in order to provide transparency and guidance in the way construction components are used and reused, in order to make them readily available to designers and contractors. Smart technologies carry the potential to aid the development and uptake of this system by enabling efficient tracking, storage and archiving, while providing information relevant to the environmental and economic savings that can be regained, enabling also better decision-making during construction and deconstruction works. However, further research is required in order to investigate the opportunities and constraints of the use of these technologies. © 2015 The Authors.",Construction and demolition waste (CDW); Construction components; Infrastructure; Interventions; Reuse,Construction industry; Decision making; Demolition; Construction and demolition waste; Construction sectors; Infrastructure; Interventions; New business development; New business models; Reuse; Structural component; Environmental technology; construction; demolition; infrastructure; recycling; structural component; waste; building industry; building material; commercial phenomena; construction work; cost control; decision making; environmental health; environmental protection; priority journal; professional development; recycling; Review; solid waste management; technology,Review,,,,,,

Although it is obvious that the construction industry has been crucial for realizing building and civil infrastructures, it is also clear that building activities have a big impact on the environment. Still growing and developing societies and economies do need even more buildings, more roads etc. The question is how all these needs can be accomplished without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs (Brundtland Report). In this contribution the urgency of a sustainable construction industry is explained. The need for a change from building in the service of growth to building in the service of sustainability is emphasized. Comprehensive models, with which the entire building cycle can be simulated, would enable engineers to analyse the building and construction process with respect to the demand for raw materials and energy, maintenance and repair, renovation and retrofitting and, finally, recycling and reuse of materials and/or structural components. The option of developing a serious game for sustainable construction is discussed and recommended. With such a game the whole building cycle is simulated, ranging from decision making by stakeholders to execution on the site, curing, maintenance and repair in the service life phase, decommissioning, recycling and reuse. © 2019 Delft University of Technology.

A third strategy is currently (re)emerging: The reuse of structural components over multiple service lives and in new layouts. Still in its infancy, this circular economy strategy disrupts structural design practice in many ways: Rather than manufacturing components after the design of a system, the system is synthesised from a given stock of reclaimed components; versatility, reversibility and transformability become hard requirements for all loadbearing systems and components; costs, performance and environmental assessments span multiple service lifecycles. There is consequently a sudden lack of expertise, design tools, technological solutions and relevant metrics.

Load-bearing systems have a particularly large environmental impact because of their material and energy intensive manufacturing process. This paper aims to address the reduction of building structures environmental impacts through reusing structural elements for multiple service lives. Reuse avoids sourcing raw materials and requires little energy for reprocessing. However, to design a new structure reusing elements available from a stock is a challenging problem of combinatorial nature. This is because the structural system layout is a result of the available elements’ mechanical and geometric properties. In this paper, structural optimization formulations are proposed to design truss systems from available stock elements. Minimization of weight, cut-off waste and embodied energy are the objective functions subject to ultimate and serviceability constraints. Case studies focusing on embodied energy minimization are presented for: (1) three roof systems with predefined geometry and topology; (2) a bridge structure whose topology is optimized using the ground structure approach; (3) a geometry optimization to better match the optimal topology from 2 and available stock element lengths. In order to benchmark the energy savings through reuse, the optimal layouts obtained with the proposed methods are compared to weight-optimized solutions made of new material. For these case studies, the methods proposed in this work enable reusing stock elements to design structures embodying up to 71% less energy and hence having a significantly lower environmental impact with respect to structures made of new material. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Embodied energy; Reuse; Stock assignment; Structural optimization,Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Geometry; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent computing; Roofs; Shape optimization; Topology; Embodied energy; Energy intensive manufacturing; Geometric properties; Geometry optimization; Load-bearing systems; Optimization formulations; Reuse; Stock assignment; Structural optimization,Conference Paper,,,,,,

These methods are relevant when reusing structural elements over multiple service lives. Reuse has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of building structures because it avoids sourcing new material, it reduces waste and it requires little energy. When reusing elements, cross-section and length availability have a major influence on the structural design. In previous own work, design of truss structures from a stock of elements was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. It was shown that this method produces solutions which are global optima in terms of stock utilization. This work extends previous formulations to stock-constrained optimization of frame structures subject to ultimate and serviceability limit states hence expanding the range of structural typologies that can be designed through reuse. Fundamental to this method is the globally optimal assignment of available stock elements to member positions in the frame structure. Two scenarios are considered: (A) the use of individual stock elements for each member of the frame, and (B) a cutting stock approach, where multiple members of the frame are cut from a single stock element. Numerical case studies are presented to show the applicability of the proposed method to practical designs. To carry out the case studies, a stock of elements was inventoried from shop drawings of deconstructed buildings. Results show that through reusing structural elements a significant reduction of embodied greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved compared to optimized structures made of new elements. © Copyright © 2020 Brütting, Senatore, Schevenels and Fivet.",assignment problem; cutting stock problem; frame structures; greenhouse gas emissions; Life Cycle Assessment; reuse; structural optimization,,Article,,,,,,

Besides, construction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. According to the waste hierarchies, reuse is preferred to recycling; however, most of the recovery of construction and demolition wastes happens in the form of recycling and not reuse. Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts’ opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study. Furthermore, the results of the survey are used to develop an easy-to-understand learner for assessing the technical reusability of the structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. The results indicate that the most significant factors affecting the reuse of building structural components are design-related including, matching the design of the new building with the strength of the recovered element. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Building structure; Gaussian process; K-nearest neighbours; Random forest; Reuse; Supervised machine learning,Construction industry; Decision trees; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Machine components; Nearest neighbor search; Structural design; Support vector machines; Surveys; Building structure; End of lives; Gaussian Processes; K-near neighbor; Load-bearing; Probabilistics approach; Random forests; Reuse; Structural elements; Supervised machine learning; Recycling,Article,,,,,,

In particular, our intent was that of giving the idea of the incipient motion retained in buds. This concept has been rendered in a trivalent way. The most evident interpretation is formal and is represented by the shape given to the structure, which depicts a bud. The mechanical behavior of bent raw bamboo culms that are in the process of releasing their elastic energy and spread upwards is used to symbolize the retained vital energy included in buds. Finally, the building material, chosen to be left almost untouched after harvesting, and the design of structural details, which foster to reuse of structural elements, actualize the reference to the nature given by the contest theme. The design process started from the conceptualization and admiration for raw bamboo culms that are taken as the main and determinant elements of the project. The design choices take advantage of the several aspects connected with the use of this building material such as its strength and weathering, ease of use, assembly, and dismantling costs. We were also concerned about emphasizing the ecological, economical, aesthetic, and mechanical properties of the raw material such as the high specific resistance to traction and bending and the natural cylindrical shape of culms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Active-bending; Bamboo culm; Reusable joints,,Book Chapter,,,,,,

The fabrication boundaries of the material are constantly stretching: visible metal connections are minimized and glass surfaces are maximized, resulting to pure all-glass structures. Still, due to the prevalence of the float glass industry, all-glass structures are currently confined to the limited forms and shapes that can be generated by planar, 2D glass elements. Moreover, despite the fact that glass is fully recyclable, most of the glass currently employed in buildings is neither reused nor recycled due to its perplexed disassembly and its contamination from coatings and adhesives. Cast glass can be the answer to the above restraints, as it can escape the design limitations generated from the 2-dimensional nature of float glass. By pouring molten glass into moulds, solid 3-dimensional glass components can be attained of considerably larger cross-sections and of virtually any shape. These monolithic glass objects can form repetitive units for large all glass-structures that do not buckle due to slender proportions and thus can take full advantage of the stated compressive strength of glass. Such components can be accordingly shaped to interlock towards easily assembled structures that do not require the use of adhesives for further bonding. In addition, cast glass units–due to their increased cross section– can tolerate a higher degree of impurities and thus can be produced by using waste glass as a raw source. © 2019, TU Delft Open.

Design problems form an essential component of experiments in creativity research. However, the formulation of a design problem for an experiment is still a challenging task. An opportunity for the design community is leverage existing design problems to reduce a source of difference between experiments and increase the validity of new method and tools. To answer this question, fifty-five design problems, published over the past fifteen years, were collected and analyzed using two approaches. First, the information content of the design problems was assessed based on five structural elements. A protocol study was developed with four independent evaluators, who were asked to identify the five elements in a set of design problems. A high correlation was observed for the characteristics: goal of a problem, functional requirements, non-functional requirement and reference to an existing product. A low correlation was observed for the characteristics information about end user. The results suggest that this approach could serve as a useful tool in comparing and selecting problems with a desired number of elements. In the second approach, latent semantic analysis was used to compare the design problems. Latent semantic analysis enables design problem similarity to be computed prior to solving the problem. However, this method cannot identify the nuances in problem representations, which could potentially affect solution development. The paper concludes with an appeal to research community of using similar or benchmarked design problems, and postulate other means to enable comparison or development of problems in creativity research.

This paper gives an overview of buildings that efficiently reuse structural components as well as a review of current research efforts addressing structural reuse. The first case study is the design process of an elastic gridshell made from reclaimed skis. This project demonstrates the potential of ensuring structural performance while working with uncharacterized and heterogeneous materials. In general, designing structures from a stock of reclaimed elements entails reversing the conventional structural design process. The synthesis of structures has to follow the availability of elements and their mechanical and geometric properties. Developed tools that facilitate such design from reused elements while minimizing embodied environmental impacts are presented in this paper. A second case study demonstrates the relevance of such tools through a conceptual train station roof made from electric pylon elements. Lastly, some key challenges related to the design of structural systems from reused elements are presented. These research initiatives constitute a first step to understand and support the design of load-bearing systems from reused elements and hence to bring the construction industry closer to circular economy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Availability; Buildings; Construction industry; Electric tools; Environmental impact; Inflatable structures; Obsolescence; Reclamation; Embodied environmental impact; Geometric properties; Heterogeneous materials; Load-bearing components; Research initiatives; Structural component; Structural performance; Technological challenges; Structural analysis,Conference Paper,,,,,,

The greatest scope for the structural engineer to influence the sustainability of a scheme is found in the choice and specification of the structural components and materials. The structural engineer can directly achieve a reduction in the embodied energy of the structure and the financial cost, along with additional advantages associated with a reduced demand on finite resources by reusing components and materials. Some of the challenges facing an increase in the reuse of structural components include the lack of a mature secondary market, health and safety issues surrounding the dismantling of buildings, along with problems with the processing and assurance of the components before reuse. It has been observed that it is possible to procure and use reclaimed structural components in new projects the challenges to reuse such structural materials.",,Embodied energy; Financial costs; Health and safety; New projects; Secondary market; Structural component; Structural engineer; Structural materials; Engineers; Materials,Short Survey,,,,,,

One underexploited option to reduce embodied carbon is the reuse of structural steel. However, in the UK, work by Sansom and Avery (2014) suggests a picture of declining levels of reuse. This paper explores why this is the case by identifying the practical barriers to structural steel reuse through a series of semi-structured interviews with UK construction industry members. Whilst there were many identified barriers, five practical barriers were prioritised as being most significant: cost, availability/storage, no client demand, traceability and supply chain gaps/lack of integration. These contrast with those most commonly identified in global literature: cost, supply chain gaps/integration, risk, jointing technique, composite construction and time for deconstruction; with only two overlaps: cost and supply chain gaps/integration. Many of the barriers from literature have a technical focus (reducing salvage yield rather than completely preventing reuse) differing from the largely systemic barriers that the interviews prioritised. These systemic barriers will need to be dealt with first to increase reuse rates. This will require a coordinated approach across the UK construction supply chain. Building on interview insights, this paper proposes four mechanisms to overcome these systemic barriers: (1) the creation of a database of suppliers/reused section availability, (2) a demonstration of client demand (3) technical guidance and education for the construction industry and (4) government leadership. Together these mechanisms would improve reuse rates in the UK, reduce the embodied emissions of the built environment and play a crucial role in meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Barriers; Circular economy; Construction; Embodied carbon; Steel reuse; Sustainability,Building materials; Concrete slabs; Construction; Construction industry; Costs; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Steel construction; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Barriers; Circular economy; Composite construction; Embodied carbons; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Semi structured interviews; Technical guidances; UK construction industry; Gas emissions,Article,,,,,,

In spite of the potential benefits, and in a time when “sustainability” and “climate change” are critical societal issues, the question arises: why are greater rates of structural steel reuse not being observed? One of the major factors in the rate of structural steel reuse is how decision-makers understand the life cycle implications of their choice to recycle steel rather than reuse it. This paper contributes towards our understanding of these implications, particularly the cost implications, of reuse as an alternative to recycling by presenting a streamlined life cycle analysis and identifying the major contributors to each process. The results of a case study indicate that a significant reduction in some life cycle impact metrics (greenhouse gas emissions, water use) can result from reusing structural steel rather than recycling it. The largest contributors to the life cycle impact of recycling were the shredding, melting, and forming sub-processes. The largest contributor to reuse was the deconstruction sub-process. A total life cycle cost analysis is performed to understand the cost of damages to the environment and human health in combination with the cost of construction activities. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are also conducted to quantify variability in the results and determine economic conditions where the two processes have an equal cost. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Construction; Deconstruction; Life cycle analysis; Life cycle costing; Recycling; Reuse; Structural steel,construction method; cost analysis; decision making; economic conditions; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; life cycle analysis; recycling; steel; sustainability,Article,,,,,,
