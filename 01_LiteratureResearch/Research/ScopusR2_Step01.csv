However, there is uncertainty about which urban heat mitigation strategies (UHMSs) can provide better solutions for a specific urban context. There is a compelling need for local governments to automate the decision-making process and optimise the combination of UHMSs to maximise the mitigation outcomes for their cities. We develop a novel decision-making framework that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into urban heat mitigation in the built environment to enable an automated process of decision making. The novel decision-making framework comprises: the ontology-based knowledge representation of UHMSs and their relationships with urban contexts and performance assessment to share knowledge in urban heat mitigation domain; sensitivity analysis of the environmental, social and economic performance of UHMSs to get key variables for UHMSs; and genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimisation of UHMSs. The novel decision-making framework enables generating the context-based optimised UHMS combinations to support local governments’ decision-making. The research outcomes will advance interdisciplinary knowledge about using AI techniques in the decision-making process for urban heat mitigation. © 2022","Multi-objective optimisation; Sensitive planning and design variables; Urban contexts, Ontology; Urban heat mitigation strategies","Automation; Behavioral research; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Sensitivity analysis; Context ontology; Decision-making frameworks; Design variables; Mitigation strategy; Multi-objectives optimization; Planning and design; Sensitive planning and design variable; Urban context; Urban context, ontology; Urban heat mitigation strategy; Multiobjective optimization; artificial intelligence; decision making; genetic algorithm; knowledge; local government; optimization; planning process; urban design; urban planning; article; built environment; decision making; genetic algorithm; government; heat; human; multiobjective optimization; ontology; sensitivity analysis",Article

The ontology can be useful to create a knowledge management system for different experts involved in the process of the building renovation, to extend the information and stretch the domain from the individual building to the environment. Knowledge about what entities and attributes to select is captured based on literature and investigating the pilot demonstration sites. Such an ontology can help to structure the surrounding data to support processes in different stages of the renovation. The final goal is to support planners in decision making process namely in site planning and pre-data collection phase, energy modeling, comfort analysis and so on to control cost and quality. Moreover, it can be valuable in further studies of integrating data of various sources for construction purposes.

However, BIM has predominantly generated value in the design phase of a project, while the potential benefits in the construction phase have been disregarded for many years and are now gaining importance. Trending advancements try to utilize existing BIM data, e.g by linking a digital building model with planning efforts of the construction project and create new knowledge to improve construction. In this paper, we are interested in exploring how semantic models and Linked Building Data (LBD) can support value creation in the construction phase. The presented use case tries to answer the question how the planning of Temporary Construction Items (TCIs) can be improved by semantically describing and classifying TCIs in an ontology that allows to utilize TCI information with BIM data. TCIs only experience little attention in the current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the outcome of a project. Thus, the creation of an ontology in this field shall lead to a better and more automated consideration of TCIs in construction planning. Here, we follow the recommendation of the W3C - LBD community group to extend or develop new ontologies and propose the TCI ontology3 as the main contribution. We first introduce the TCI ontology and its relation to other ontologies. Then we demonstrate the value of the ontology by answering competency questions and finally provide a proof of concept of planning TCIs by utilizing the new ontology. The proposal of the TCI ontology is accompanied by a second ontology for Location-Based Scheduling (LBS) to consider the time dimension of planning. The main focus, however, lies on the development and presentation of the TCI ontology whereas the LBS ontology will be further developed in future research. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",BIM; Linked building data; Ontology; Temporary construction items,Architectural design; Classification (of information); Construction; Construction industry; Semantics; Building Information Modelling; Construction phase; Design phase; Linked building data; Location based; Modeling data; Ontology's; Site planning; Temporary construction; Temporary construction item; Ontology,Conference Paper

The goal of this research is to provide a new methodology to handle the data-heterogeneity problems encountered in a construction project. This research proposes a tree-structured product model, which binds design knowledge, cost data and schedule data together, as a feasible solution for the data integration problem in construction projects. The methodology uses the knowledge representation of construction projects based on an ontology. Meta-data are used to describe the conceptual structure of the project knowledge. The concept of views is used to answer particular queries from different domains. A general methodology is under development to support queries about a particular construction project from different user perspectives based on heterogeneous construction data sources in a dynamic environment. The research is composed of two major parts: (1) organize the heterogeneous construction data into a tree structure; and (2) retrieve information and obtain domain views by specifying the ways of traversing the tree. The future goal is to develop a prototype that will support some of the major functions needed in today's construction projects.

To better support structural designers in achieving a balance between structural requirements and environmental protection, this paper builds an ontology framework for assessing the embodied EI of building structures. The ontology is based on a building environmental performance assessment model-BEPAS, and takes account of EI related both to material consumption and construction activities.

Here we attempt to situate dialectical thinking as a constructive meta-mediation of this opposition between deconstruction and metalanguage. Dialectical thinking offers us a way to think about the processual nature of reason itself as a force of thought mediating being. In this mode of understanding, we attempt to think the possibility of articulating the meaning and importance of ‘metaontology’ defined as the ontology of epistemology. In a metaontology, we treat the structure of concepts not as reflecting external territory (map is a territory), nor as existing at a distance from external territory (map is not the territory), but as having their own territory (geometry) (i.e. maps as territory). We attempt to approach metaontology by reflectively observing the singularity of the author’s own internal territorial map, revealing a ‘quadratic twisted circularity’; and also the movement of the symbolic order itself, revealing a possible invariant unsymbolizable real. From these reflections we dive into the foundations of dialectical thinking, starting with Plato, and then exploring modifications introduced by Hegel and Lacan. Finally, we offer a dialectical structure of knowledge for the twenty-first century. This offering is meant only as an offer, a consideration, for how dialectics can be deployed at the location of key antagonisms in the contemporary field. The hope is that future dialecticians will be able to utilize this logic to engage in crucial intellectual interventions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book Chapter

However, in the application process of forward design, there is a lack of standardized implementation guidance and mature technical support, leading to many problems such as a redundancy of model information, heterogeneity of data information, and low efficiency of transmission. Based on this, this paper proposes a model view delivery method of forward design for prefabricated buildings. Firstly, a simplified assembly model and an assembly knowledge model are designed and extended with IFC (Industry Foundation Classes), then we realize the knowledge visualization expression by combining with an ontology semantic system. For the model view of a prefabricated building domain, this paper realizes the reusable concept module by ontology IDM (Information Delivery Manual) and properties selection of knowledge graphs, and then completes the model view delivery through data mapping and IfcDoc (Ifc Documentation Generator) tool output. Finally, the implementation model of information delivery management for forward design is built with model view delivery as the central link. © 2022 by the authors.",assembly model; BIM; forward design; knowledge graph; model view definition,,Article

This interest is also fostered at a district scale with new technological solutions being developed to achieve more efficient designs. In response to this challenge, a web-based platform for district energy-efficient retrofitting design projects has been proposed in the context of OptEEmAL research project. In order to provide data integration and interoperability between BIM/GIS models and energy simulation tools through this platform, a District Data Model (DDM) has been devised. In this model, fields for urban sustainable regeneration (energy, social, environment, comfort, urban morphology and economic) are related to existing ontological models based on the CityGML and IFC schemas. This paper discusses how the semantic representation from IFC and CityGML files with different levels of detail can be integrated to obtain consistent description of the district in the proposed district data model. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,Architectural design; Construction industry; Data integration; Ontology; Process engineering; Retrofitting; Semantics; Construction sectors; Efficient designs; Energy simulation; Levels of detail; Ontological models; Semantic representation; Technological solution; Web based platform; Energy efficiency,Conference Paper

The system is designed as a distributed information and service platform. The backbone of the system is a layered ontology framework. Along with the information system, a novel approach to process and multi-model driven construction management is developed that allows for sharing distributed, yet interrelated, engineering and management application models in so called multi-models. A major challenge of the system is the management of the information and model logistics as well as the interdependencies among the application models. In order to support the retrieval of information from different project phases, domains and organizations and their combination in coherent multi-models, an ontology framework is developed. It defines the overall information space of the application models describing the application models content and their links in multi-models as well as the collaboration processes within the virtual organization of the project. The proposed system represents a paradigm shift. The information space is no longer product-model-centric. Central to the model-based information space is the process model that interrelates application model views contained in multi-models required for specific planning, production and analysis tasks. The activities are considered the enabler to semi-automatically combine dedicated information pieces of existing application models in new multi-models. Therefore we have identified the instantiation of activities and their combination to valid process chains to be the bottleneck to make the process and multi-model driven construction management efficient. As a consequence, we develop a new process and multi-model generation method, which is based on process modules formalized in description logics. The process modules combine distinct methods of Reference Process Modelling and Business Process Objects. In the generated processes, related application models, and populated multi-models are hierarchically structured (1) to support the utilization of project information by different actors of the hierarchical project organization and (2) to handle engineering and management knowledge and decisions piecewise during process generation in accordance to the hierarchy levels of the involved decision makers, thereby reducing the overall complexity of decision making. The paper discusses: (1) the main components of the system for interlinking and sharing models and information, (2) the ontology-based multi-model framework and the basics for the hierarchical structuring of the models, and (3) the generation of integrated process models. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However, within the context of information system practice in BIM, knowledge of cost estimation has not been represented, nor has it been integrated into the processes based on BIM. This paper intends to establish an innovative means of taking data from the BIM linked to a project, and using it to create the necessary items for a bill of quantity that will enable cost estimation to be undertaken for the project. Our framework is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implementation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). In order to achieve this, a prototype is created that allows a cost item for the bill of quantity to be spontaneously generated, by means of the semantic web ontology and a forward chain algorithm. Within this paper, ‘cost items’ signify the elements included in a bill of quantity, including details of their description, quantity and price. As a means of authenticating the process being developed, the authors of this work effectively implemented it in the production of cost items. In addition, the items created were contrasted with those produced by specialists. For this reason, this innovative framework introduces the possibility of a new means of applying semantic web ontology and forward chain algorithm to construction professional practice resulting in automatic cost estimation. These key outcomes demonstrate that, decoupling the professional practice into three key components of syntax, semantics and pragmatics can provide tangible benefits to domain user. © 2016",BIM; Computer-aided professional practice; Cost estimation; Expert system; IFC; Ontology; Rule-based; Semantic,Architectural design; Chains; Construction industry; Costs; Expert systems; Knowledge based systems; Ontology; Professional aspects; Semantic Web; Semantics; Syntactics; Bill of quantities; Collaborative process; Construction professionals; Cost estimations; Information types; Professional practices; Rule based; Semantic Web ontologies; Cost estimating,Article

This paper aims to develop a new information management method to cope with the risk problems involved in dealing with such data, based on domain ontologies of the construction industry, to help manage PPP risks, share and reuse risk knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: Risk knowledge concepts are acquired and summarized through PPP failure cases and an extensive literature review to establish a domain framework for risk knowledge using ontology technology to help manage PPP risks. Findings: The results indicate that the risk ontology is capable of capturing key concepts and relationships involved in managing PPP risks and can be used to facilitate knowledge reuse and storage beneficial to risk management. Research limitations/implications: The classes in the risk knowledge ontology model constructed in this research do not yet cover all the information in PPP project risks and need to be further extended. Moreover, only the framework and basic methods needed are developed, while the construction of a working ontology model and the relationship between implicit and explicit knowledge is a complicated process that requires repeated modifications and evaluations before it can be implemented. Practical implications: The ontology provides a basis for turning PPP risk information into risk knowledge to allow the effective sharing and communication of project risks between different project stakeholders. It can also have the potential to help reduce the dependence on subjectivity by mining, using and storing tacit knowledge in the risk management process. Originality/value: The apparent suitability of the nine classes of PPP risk knowledge (project model, risk type, risk occurrence stage, risk source, risk consequence, risk likelihood, risk carrier, risk management measures and risk case) is identified, and the proposed construction method and steps for a complete domain ontology for PPP risk management are unique.

An ontology is a conceptual semantic model that attempts to capture human knowledge (both explicit and tacit) in a consistent manner. Ontologies include three main elements: a taxonomy (common vocabulary presented in concept trees), set of relationships (linking concepts across trees) and axioms (limitation/constraints on the behavior of concepts). The ontology was used to develop a portal for broadcasting highway design features to local communities.

The study aims to assess recent safety technologies which can be used to control the risk of FFH on construction sites, especially in urban building construction projects. A scoping review was conducted to identify such technologies and provide insight into their application in the construction industry.

Project information is composed by several documents among which graphical drawings traditionally represent a fundamental component. The fragmentation of this information along the construction process can be addressed with the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM). One of the fundamental components of BIM is the development of information models. These models contain a defined and shared semantic structure that allows the simulation of real entities in a digital environment. However, the quality of this simulation is bounded by the limits of the instruments used for its development. The work presented in this paper is the development a rules-based system that makes inference upon ontologies obtained from IFC models to recognise real estates units and their destination of uses starting from building information models. The proposed application aims to overcome the limits imposed by the IFC schema focusing both the reasoning process and the resulting enriching information on ontologies. © 2019 IEEE.",Building Information Modelling (BIM); Expert System; IfcOWL; Inference Engine; Prolog; Semantics,Construction; Construction industry; Engines; Expert systems; Inference engines; Information theory; Knowledge engineering; Ontology; Semantics; Building Information Model - BIM; Building Information Modelling; Construction process; Construction sectors; Fundamental component; IfcOWL; Prolog; Rule-based techniques; Architectural design,Conference Paper

Using semantic systems in building these tools (along with database and/or AI-based systems) allows for more efficient representation of tacit knowledge. Such systems are based on a common ontology of the subject domain, where entities (such as actors, processes and products) are interlinked to represent the essence of the knowledge in the domain. The paper presents a taxonomy for building construction. The taxonomy includes 6000 concepts and was developed using OWL. It maps to existing classification systems to assure better coverage. The taxonomy is the first attempt to present building construction knowledge in a semantic way. It also represents the foundations developing ontology-based corporate memory systems. To demonstrate the role and contribution of the proposed taxonomy a prototypical ontology for building construction was developed. Furthermore, a framework for agent-based system for supporting semi-automatic generation of reports such as lessons learned, work forms, and meeting agendas. Such agents allow organizations to capture and document its knowledge (in a taxonomy-complaint format) and to feed back post-project knowledge into new ones through access to lessons learned and through pre-defined meeting agendas. Access to these reports is done through semantic search according to the proposed taxonomy. Future research will develop a formal ontology and further develop the framework and implement it in actual organizations. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Similarly, in the construction industry, logistics operations are a crucial part that directly influence the construction operations. Construction operations management requires various stakeholders to collaborate through effective communication and prompt information sharing. However, logistics management in construction is often challenged by insufficient information management, lack of formalized information standards and poor information interoperability among heterogeneous systems. Semantic Web technologies advance information management support and improve information interoperability. In this research, we present a domain-level ontology as a common information reference for standardizing and integrating construction logistics information, and finally to improve the efficiency and transparency of logistics information management. The proposed ontology provides information interoperability between logistics management and construction workflow management. The ontology was evaluated by automatic consistency checking and answering the competency questions (CQs) via SPARQL queries. Furthermore, we used actual schedule and material delivery data of a construction project to evaluate the proposed ontology to see if it could support the material kitting logistics practice. We provide a valid ontology that is able support the logistics information management for the construction. The research is limited to providing a single example application of the ontology. Future research should focus on extending the ontology for different specific solutions to yield standardized information management for construction operations. © 2020 Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot.

Most of them on this issue have been emphasized the necessity and utilization of information, rather than how to exchange, share and transfer safety data efficiently in the construction industry. With this regard, this paper proposes the Social Network System for Sharing Construction Safety & Health Knowledge (SNSS), which utilizes state-of-the-art of semantic wiki web and ontology construction technologies for better communication and representation for construction safety information. The SNSS is developed on the basis of safety semantic wiki template (SSWT), which consists of the following three modules: 1) A Safety information module (SIM) which upload common accident and hazard information for sharing; 2) A Safety knowledge module (SKM) where the safety information is refined, confirmed and transferred to safety knowledge; 3) A Safety dissemination module (SDM) which allows its users to monitor, manage and retrieve safety information and knowledge easily. The SNSS is tested by a scenario of using falling accident information by which the potentials and limitations of the system were addressed.

0,Ghasemi F.,A step towards the theoretical model of dissipated and bifurcated order in the new international politics,2022,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85117532167&partnerID=40&md5=c4248b4862cf1105caec4c47ff5c1b2a,"Introduction There are developments that can change the world order. The transition of the international system from simple and linear to a complex and chaotic system, in the context of international multi-body systems, has brought new challenges to explain its order. International relations literature has studied order from a simple and classical perspective and the international system is perceived as a linear system, while this is a complex and chaotic. Complexity theory offers a new set of conceptual tools to help explain the global order. It constitutes a challenge to more traditional forms of theorizing in international politics and offers new ways of thinking about it. A new pattern of order is emerging, which can be conceptualized as the dissipative and bifurcated order. Methodology The most prominent methodological aspect of achieving this goal is to utilize the abductive model in theoretical inference and to utilize the complexity-chaos theory assumptions and its conceptualization in the complex international relations. The abduction methodology refers to some form of explanatory reasoning. It refers to the place of explanatory reasoning in generating hypotheses, and also in justifying them. Abduction is finding the best explanation. Chaos and complexity as two important characteristics of the international system lead to dissipative and bifurcated order as the best explanation of the new world order. Results and discussion Complexity theory offers a new set of conceptual tools to help explain the global order. It constitutes a challenge to more traditional forms of theorizing in international politics and offers new ways of thinking about it. A new pattern of order is emerging, which can be conceptualized as the dissipative and bifurcated order. This article seeks to provide a theoretical model for explaining the new order based on the element of complexity and its theories. In this regard, the author pioneers the dissipative and bifurcated order as an innovative theoretical model to the scientific community of international relations. This model is based on the ontology and epistemological foundations of complexity theory. Conclusions The article provides a new theoretical model in the framework of dissipative and bifurcated order by establishing a link between multibody and complex systems theory and international order. The model has the essential features as follows: The multibody system as main construction of new international order; Systemic pressures as the cause of bifurcation, and formation of dissipative structures and processes; Bifurcating and dissipation as the main response to systemic pressures; Feedback strategic stability and feedback strategic deadlock as a new concept to explain the balance of power and dynamic equilibrium; The layered hierarchy as one of the most important theoretical concepts to explain the new order. In this model, polarity is replaced by centrality. The order has two properties, including circularity, centrality-based and layered, nested hierarchy; The convergence of different sub-networks and their dynamics and forming a global nested network along with differentiated clusters; The dissipative and bifurcated control system as the main model of control; The equation of internal order and external disorder. This type of control system provides order by using internal capacities and creating branches in the external Oscillational equilibrium as the main route to evolution. © 2022, Iranian Association of Geopolitics.

In the case of healthcare facilities, where the policy environment is characterized by change on several fronts, fixed requirements could constrain their evolvability and sustainability. Future-proofing is a response to uncertainty whereby a physical structure is designed to respond to future changes in requirements, change of use, strategic perspectives, business drivers, new policies and changing climate. The paper investigates the causal powers that explain how and why future-proofing decisions achieve a sustainable outcome. A critical realist lens is adopted to develop a configurational perspective of future-proofing design evolution. Critical Realism's open systems ontology of social reality can account for the fact that outcomes are not predictable and can better explain the nature of causation in complex social interactions such as construction projects. A case study research design was conducted comprising in-depth interviews with healthcare construction professionals in a UK setting. The study contributes to the sustainability literature by offering four generative mechanisms of future-proofing decision making and how they contingently lead - or fail to lead - to future-proof outcomes. Two change mechanisms and two problem mechanisms are presented, together with their configuration under the right conditions and context to lead to design decisions for construction projects capable of adapting to a range of possible futures. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Both two- and three-dimensional finite element models employing solid and shell elements with material, geometrical and interfacial non-linearity were established to examine the full range structural behaviour of composite beams. In this paper, two-dimensional finite element models employing plane stress elements are established to examine the structural behaviour of perforated composite beams, and shear connectors with non-linear deformation characteristics are incorporated into the models through the use of both vertical and horizontal springs. It is demonstrated that after careful calibration against test data, the finite element models are able to predict the load carrying capacities of composite beams with large rectangular web openings against 'Vierendeel' mechanism satisfactorily. Moreover, a number of important structural quantities such as local axial and shear forces together with local bending moments acting onto the composite and the steel tee sections at failure are obtained after data analyses. Together with the load carrying capacities, these quantities compare favourably with the values obtained from a design method proposed previously by the authors, and hence, this provides quantitative justification to the proposed design method. Furthermore, the finite element models provide detailed information on the structural behaviour of shear connectors along the beam length, such as the longitudinal shear forces, the pull-out forces as well as the slippage of the shear connectors. Based on the findings of the finite element modelling, a number of recommendations on the design and construction of perforated composite beams are suggested. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In contemplating the relationship between theory and practice throughout the life cycle of the built environment, along with the range of involved stakeholders; and illustrated by reference to the example of the contemporary 'workplace'; an ambivalent approach to theorizing at the local level of involved actors is proposed. In this approach, conceptualization of the built environment is based not upon early exclusive either/or choices between different theories and models, but rather upon inclusive both/and considerations. However, this does not mean that all are considered as equally valid in the outcomes of decision-making, and the role of power and politics is acknowledged within the process of negotiation of a 'good' outcome.

Circular economy (CE) which is regenerative and restorative by design is recommended as the business model for resource efficiency. While there is a need for businesses and organisations to switch from linear to CE, there are several challenges that needs addressing such as business models and the criticism of CE projects often being small scale. Technology can be an enabler toward scaling up CE; however, the prime challenge is to identify technologies that can allow predicting, tracking and proactively monitoring product's residual value to motivate businesses to pursue circularity decisions. In this paper, we propose an IoT-enabled decision support system (DSS) for CE business model that effectively allows tracking, monitoring, and analysing products in real time with the focus on residual value. The business model is implemented using an ontological model. This model is complemented by a semantic decision support system. The semantic ontological model, first of its kind, is evaluated for technical compliance.

This study analyzed existing integration strategies and developed an ontology for integrating the data modeling standards of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) CityGML, IndoorGML, and SensorThings API. To cope with the broad definition of 'things' in the IoT, the proposed ontology supports multiple views of things, including the a-building-as-a-thing, a-room-as-a-thing, an-opening-as-a-thing, and a-device-as-a-thing views. Thus, the proposed ontology relates information from these three standards and supports semantic queries. We demonstrated the proposed solution in smart home, smart security, smart health care, and fire evacuation systems. Overall, the proposed solution can facilitate the integration of standard-based IoT resources and city models to support smart city applications. © 2014 IEEE.",City models; Internet of Things (IoT); ontology; open standard; smart city,Automation; Data integration; Integration; Intelligent buildings; Internet of things; Ontology; Smart city; Built environment; City model; Digital system; Domain model; Human-systems; Ontology's; Open Standards; Physical systems; Smart city.; Semantics,Article

In prefabricated construction, there are exacting requirements for information sharing. Also, data in a prefabricated component supply chain tend to be dispersed in design, production, transportation and other stages. In other words, such data are significantly multi-source heterogeneous. Without an effective way of participating in supply chain dynamic collaboration, decision-making at various stages and resource allocation can be extremely challenging. This paper proposes a decision support framework for prefabricated component supply chain based on ontology and multi-agent. The framework comprises the ontology layer (i.e. provides data support for the model), the agent interaction layer (i.e. serves as the communication hub to coordinate the data transmission between modules), and the agent simulation layer (i.e. simulates interaction behavior of participants, and supports decision making). Using the Shanghai Chenxiang Road Station complex project as a case study, the paper demonstrates the validity of the proposed ontology and multi-agent based decision support framework. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Multi-agent; Ontology; Prefabricated components; Simulation; Supply chain,Construction industry; Decision making; Multi agent systems; Ontology; Prefabricated construction; Supply chains; Communication hub; Decision support framework; Information sharing; Interaction behavior; Multi agent; Prefabricated components; Simulation; Supply chain dynamics; Decision support systems,Article

However, research shows that HVAC systems only ensure occupants’ satisfaction in the 11% of the commercial buildings. The advancing spread of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the maturity of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) may contribute to develop accurate predictive models which address this challenge. But data analysts in charge of developing these predictive models may feel overwhelmed if they have insufficient domain expertise. In this article, the ontology-driven approach proposed by the EEPSA (Energy Efficiency Prediction Semantic Assistant) is presented, in which data analysts can benefit from previously captured domain knowledge. Therefore, this article proposes the exploitation of Semantic Technologies to support data analysts in the discovery of the variables that should be considered for making accurate predictive models for thermal comfort problems within buildings. Compared with the existing tools or methods, the EEPSA is able to suggest variables that may not necessarily be included in the set of data available. This fact has a big potential nowadays, where the Linked Open Data and the third-party repositories can be exploited to incorporate relevant information. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Buildings; Data Analysis; Ontology; Thermal Comfort,Internet of things; Office buildings; Ontology; Open Data; Semantics; Thermal comfort; Built environment; Commercial building; Data analysts; Domain expertise; Efficiency predictions; HVAC system; Knowledge discoveries in database; Occupant satisfaction; Ontology's; Predictive models; Energy efficiency,Conference Paper

Several alignment variants are usually created and each one is intensely scrutinized. Variants often have individual advantages and disadvantages and can lead to different constructive designs of a tunnel. In order to find the best alignment possible the variants have to be analyzed and evaluated based on requirements and evaluation criteria, such as safety, cost, built environment and operational requirements. To perform this evaluation and to enable comprehensive decision making, a holistic planning environment is examined that includes documents and models of different domains. In general, these domain specific data differ schematically and semantically, which consequently makes it challenging to combine and compare such diverse data. For this purpose, information from different sources must be linked and evaluated in a structured way. In particular, spatial relationships have to be investigated. Therefore, in this paper, ontology databases are utilized to merge BIM and GIS at data level to create an integrated model of the entire tunneling project. Relevant information for decision-making can then be derived, such as the location of private and public buildings that are in a certain vicinity of the planned alignment. On the one hand, the implementation of queries is a popular and frequently used approach to check for semantic properties. On the other hand, using a query language to derive information from geometric data can be challenging, due to the necessity of processing geometric data prior to and during query execution. Additionally, geometric definitions can differ in the considered coordinate reference system, the dimension or the structure. To handle geometry information by employing query languages, representations are methodically transformed to well-known text literals. A simplified and uniform geometric representation can be utilized for spatial reasoning, for example by adopting GeoSPARQL methods. © 2022 The Author(s)",Alignment planning; BIM; GIS; Mechanized tunneling; Querying; Spatial reasoning,Architectural design; Cost effectiveness; Data handling; Geographic information systems; Geometry; Query languages; Semantics; Tunnels; Alignment planning; BIM; Data querying; Decisions makings; Geometric data; Mechanized tunneling; Querying; Spatial reasoning; Tunnel alignments; Tunneling project; Decision making,Article

The innovations in digital technologies in Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) sector are not just related to the enhancement of consolidated processes, but they open new collaboration methods and integration with other Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as Internet of Things (IoT), additive manufacturing, automation, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. As domain-specific software solutions are expanding their features over different sources and datasets, the need for integration and standardization of information storage and exchange arises. Semantic Web technologies are one of the emerging solutions for solving such issues, as they offer the possibility to combine data from diverse data models and multiple domains using the web. Among the ontologies developed in the last decade for the construction sector, one specific reference should be made on the ifcOWL, an IFC-based ontology representing the most used data schema industry. Nonetheless, from the standardization point of view, so far ontologies have not been considered among the standard methods for information exchange in the AEC, unlike in other sectors (e.g. ISO 15926 was firstly developed for the integration of life cycle data for process plants of oil and gas facilities).

The rapid development of e-commerce offers efficient and effective solutions, however the large number of participants in the construction industry means that the data involved are complex, and problems arise related to volume, heterogeneity, and fragmentation. Thus, the sector lags behind others in the adoption of e-commerce. In particular, data integration has become a barrier preventing further development.

The three objectives of this paper are to: define eco assets explicitly to reach a common understanding of the terms; evaluate the ontology; and discuss a potential area of application. Design/methodology/approach: A seven-step methodology was used to develop the proposed ontology: define the scope; develop the eco asset meta model (EA_MM), define taxonomy, code ontology, capture ontology, evaluate ontology and document ontology. Findings: The EA_MM was developed to represent eco asset domain knowledge, which was further extended to develop the EA_Onto, explicitly defining the eco asset knowledge in asset management. As a part of evaluation, it was found that the knowledge representation is consistent, concise, clear, complete and correct. Practical implications: Theoretically, the proposed ontology is a significant contribution to the body of knowledge in asset management. Practically, the knowledge representation provides a common understanding of eco assets for asset management experts. In addition, it will be used in applications for effective eco asset management. Originality/value: The current literature lacks explicit declaration of eco assets, how they are related to built environment for effective integration and how asset management functions are to be applied to accomplish effective eco asset management. Presently, eco assets are managed on an ad hoc basis, which need to be explicitly defined through developing an EA_Onto for implementation in applications for effective eco asset management. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Asset management; Eco asset; Eco asset knowledge management; Eco asset management; Eco asset ontology; Natural asset,,Article

The proposed solution is relevant for several manufacturing environments. However, in dynamic, semi-structured manufacturing environments that the workstations are not fixed but dynamically change over time and in which the workers are mobile and not static to some predefined workstations, the utilisation of context-aware information delivery is considered as even more relevant.

Today, with the development of the IFC project model by the IAI, the product modelling paradigm is being rapidly introduced in commercial software as well. However, actual PDT application in the AEC domain is still limited to CAD data exchange and some basic project-centred data management facilities. There is a great need of human-centred product model services supporting the engineer with additional knowledge about the models, providing customisable user-friendly capabilities for management and modification of the data, and enabling structured access to the information on the project(s) he is working on. These issues have motivated the development of an ontology framework that can serve as advanced user gateway to product model data. The suggested approach draws upon recent ICT achievements, especially regarding IFC environments.

Often, however, traditional data collection methods lack information on the spatial distribution of slum-dwellers. Remote sensing based methods could be used for a rapid inventory of the location and physical composition of slums. (Semi-)automatic detection of slums in image data is challenging, owing to the high variability in appearance and definitions across different contexts. This paper develops an ontological framework to conceptualize slums using input from 50 domain-experts covering 16 different countries. This generic slum ontology (GSO) comprises concepts identified at three levels that refer to the morphology of the built environment: the environs level, the settlement level and the object level. It serves as a comprehensive basis for image-based classification of slums, in particular, using object-oriented image analysis (OOA) techniques. This is demonstrated by with an example of local adaptation of GSO and OOA parameterization for a study area in Kisumu, Kenya. At the object level, building and road characteristics are major components of the ontology. At the settlement level, texture measures can be potentially used to represent the contrast between planned and unplanned settlements. At the environs level, factors which extend beyond the site itself are important indicators, e.g. hazards due to floods plains and marshy conditions. The GSO provides a comprehensive framework that includes all potentially relevant indicators that can be used for image-based slum identification. These characteristics may be different for other study areas, but show the applicability of the developed framework. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",Classification; Informal settlement; Object-oriented image analysis (OOA); Ontology; Slums,Automatic Detection; Built environment; Data collection method; High variability; Image data; Image-based; Image-based classification; Informal settlements; Local adaptation; Object-oriented image analysis; Ontological frameworks; Physical composition; Slums; Study areas; Classification (of information); Image analysis; Ontology; Remote sensing; Housing; image analysis; image classification; informal settlement; parameterization; remote sensing; spatial distribution; Kenya; Kisumu; Nyanza,Article

Both deficiencies create problems in fields, such as laboratory medicine, which have to report results of all types of property, preferably in a unified systematic format. The present text aims at forming a domain ontology around ""property"", with intensional definitions and systematic terms, mainly using the terminological tools - with some additions - provided by the International Standards ISO 704, 1087-1, and 10241. ""System"" and ""component"" are defined, ""quantity"" is discussed, and the generic concept ""property"" is given as 'inherent state- or process-descriptive feature of a system including any pertinent components'. Previously, the term 'kind-of-quantity' and quasisynonyms have been used as primitives; the proposed definition of ""kind-of-property"" is 'common defining aspect of mutually comparable properties'. ""Examination procedure"", ""examination method"", ""examination principle"", and ""examination"" are defined, avoiding the term 'test'. The need to distinguish between instances of ""characteristic"", ""property"", ""type of characteristic"", ""kind-of- property"", and ""property value"" is emphasized; the latter is defined together with ""property value scale"". These fundamental concepts are presented in a diagram, and the effect of adding essential characteristics to give expanded definitions is exemplified. Substitution usually leads to unwieldy definitions, but reveals circularity as does exhaustive consecutive listing of defining concepts. The top concept 〈property〉 may be generically divided according to many terminological dimensions, especially regarding which operators are allowed among the four sets =, #; <, >; +, -; and x,:. The coordinate concepts defined are termed by the modifiers 'nominal', 'ordinal', 'differential', and 'rational' before '... property'. Other possibilities are given, based on the literature, especially the stepwise division into ""nominal property"" and ""quantity""; ""ordinal quantity"" and ""unitary quantity""; ""differential unitary quantity"" and ""rational unitary quantity"". As top concepts, 〈kind-of-property〉, 〈examination procedure〉, 〈examination〉, 〈property value〉, and 〈property value scale〉 are i.a. divided homologously to 〈property〉. The term 'observation' and the modifiers 'qualitative', 'semi-quantitative', and 'quantitative' are avoided. ""Metrological unit"" and ""system of metrological units"" are defined together with a number of specific concepts. Some problems with characteristics of ""SI unit"" are discussed and an alternative system shown. The conceptions of ""metrological dimension"" are outlined, leading to a definition and specific concepts. The generally accepted IUPAC/IFCC syntax for designations of instantiated properties is 'System (specification)- Component(specification); kind-of-property(specification)', and""dedicatedkind-of-property"" is defined as 'kind-of-property with given sort of system and any pertinent sorts of component'. The related systematic terms may be generated according to ENV 1614 using generative patterns from ENV 12264. The elements of the appellation and examination result of a singular rational property are diagrammed. Finally, the possibilities of representing properties and their results by the formalisms of relation and function from Set Theory and Object-Oriented Analysis are exemplified.",,"biochemistry; clinical chemistry; examination; laboratory test; mathematical analysis; measurement; metaphysics; nomenclature; normal value; philosophy; physical chemistry; priority journal; review; theory; human; methodology; nomenclature; standard; Chemistry, Clinical; Humans; Research Design; Terminology",Review

As matter of fact, few methods exist that can help designers in such task, despite its importance in the definition of the building quality; norms and regulations, personal designer's experience, post-occupancy evaluation have shown their limit to provide predictive models of the complex phenomenon of human behaviour in built environments. With the increasing of computing power, virtual simulation techniques have been introduced in building design to control, manage and predict complex systems of building performances such as its energy or structural behaviour, but not to representation of buildings while-in-use. The Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) paradigm has been applied in building design to simulation of specific aspects of human behaviour and in specific occurrences (for instance in fire egress simulations), while a more extensive representation of users actions, behaviours, and activities is still missing. In order to overcome this lack, in this paper we propose to support agent-based simulation with a knowledge base, developed by means of ontologies and able to provide a structured system of data about human-building interaction, useful as start hypotheses for Agent-based Simulation. For its development, we rely on the general template of building knowledge management already proposed by the research group (Carrara et al., 2009), extending it to representation of the whole system users-built environment. The proposed general template, configured by the meaning - properties - rules structure, allows the formalization of users/agents entities, whose parameter, attributes and behavioural rules can encode several 'aspects' of real users and their interactions with the other entities (building components, furniture, other people) in a built environment. Currently, a first application has been developed dealing with the virtually testing of a small hospital ward, in order to evaluate the reliability and the potentiality of such approach.

NoSQL database Cassandra is used for distributed data storage among construction supply chain stakeholders. Findings - Ontology can be used to support heterogeneous data transfer and integration through web services. Distributed data storage facilitates data sharing and enhances data control. Practical implications - This paper presents examples of two ontologies for expressing construction supply chain information - ontology for material and ontology for purchase order. An example scenario is presented to demonstrate the proposed web service framework for material procurement process involving three parties, namely, project manager, contractor, and material supplier.

Part of this data concerns performance metrics expressed among others in terms of cost, energy consumption or system reliability. Such performance values are the focus of project stakeholders who try to optimize them already in building design phase. These values are computed by simulation software that reuses a subpart of the BIM data as input. This provides a better view of building performances but less on threats and underperformances in the building life cycle. Moreover, despite the existence of different risk analysis methods, these are still quite difficult to integrate into a BIM design process. This research aims at closing this gap by first, integrating risk information as well as related uncertainty sources into the BIM process. Second, a method is developed for simulating uncertainty and computing risk metrics. Finally, the evaluation of risk levels is supported by the use of semantic web technologies through a risk ontology. © 2017 The Authors.",Building Information Modeling; Decision Making; Ontology; Risk; Uncertainty,Computer software; Construction industry; Decision making; Energy utilization; Information theory; Life cycle; Ontology; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risks; Uncertainty analysis; Building Information Model - BIM; Building performance; Project stakeholders; Risk analysis methods; Semantic Web technology; Simulation software; Uncertainty; Uncertainty sources; Architectural design,Conference Paper

To ensure smooth functioning, businesses need to adhere to a set of guidelines and constraints which are efficiently represented by Business Rules(BRs). Due to the large number of inter-dependent BRs, anomalies such as inconsistencies, redundancies and circularities creep in to the rule base, which if not dealt with properly can cause the business to function improperly causing significant damage at multiple levels. Present state of the art methods identify such anomalies in BRs by converting the rules to knowledge representation (Ontology, SMT-LIBv2, etc.) and then running them on solvers. These approaches suffer from certain drawbacks, namely incomplete mappings and scalability of solvers. To overcome these shortcomings, in this paper we propose to represent the Business Rules(BRs) as Decision Diagrams (BDD, SDD, MDD, etc.) and use graph algorithms on top of their canonical representations to identify anomalies. Presently, business rules and processes are treated separately. We model rules as Decision Diagrams(DDs) to integrate with certain graphical representations of business processes (e.g., DCR Graphs, BPMN, etc.), enabling us to efficiently analyze a much more enriched set of business information. We show an initial set of mappings from business rules to Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD's), integrate with processes, identify various anomalies and outline our vision and prospective reach of this ap. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Bdd; Business rules; Decision diagrams; Mdd; Ontology; Processes; Sbvr; Sdd; Smt; Test case,Boolean functions; Graph algorithms; Knowledge representation; Mapping; Ontology; Processing; Software engineering; Surface mount technology; Business information; Business rules; Canonical representations; Decision diagram; Graphical representations; Sbvr; State-of-the-art methods; Test case; Binary decision diagrams,Conference Paper

The effective management of knowledge is vital to the survival and prosperity of a company, particularly in project-based industries such as construction. As a result, construction companies have adopted Information Technology (IT)-based KM systems (KMSs). KMS refers to the technology platform and infrastructure that an organization employs to support KM. However, the increasing attention given to KM is targeted at Large Multi-national Construction companies (LMCs), with little attention given to Small and Medium-sized Construction companies (SMCs). Compared to LMCs, SMCs need different sources and types of knowledge and technology to remain nourished and healthy. In this context, this research attempts to facilitate KM activities within SMCs through the distribution of a set of KM technologies tailored to meet the requirements of SMCs. First, we analyze key obstacles to implement KM activities within SMCs through a survey. Based on this analysis, a set of KM technologies are then identified and adapted to support the KM activities of SMCs in a feasible fashion. In addition, we discuss the expected change of organizational behavior by the distribution of those KM technologies. In the end, these technologies are synthesized into a web-based Construction Knowledge Management Portal (CKMP) system that seeks the inter-organizational sharing of construction knowledge.

Such a framework can also improve the successful accomplishment of building projects. This paper aims to use Semantic Web technologies for facilitating information exchange within existing building projects. Design/methodology/approach: In real-world building projects, the construction industry’s information supply chain may initiate from near scratch when new building projects are started resulting in diverse data structures represented in unstructured data sources, like Excel spreadsheets and documents. Large-scale data generated throughout a building's life-cycle requires exchanging and processing during an asset's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase. Building information modelling (BIM) processes and related technologies can address some of the challenges and limitations of information exchange and interoperability within new building projects. However, the use of BIM in existing and retrofit assets has been hampered by the challenges surrounding the limitations of existing technologies. Findings: The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it briefly outlines the framework previously developed for generating semantically enriched 3D retrofit models. Secondly, a framework is proposed focussing on facilitating the information exchange and interoperability for existing buildings. Semantic Web technologies and standards, such as Web Ontology Language and existing AEC domain ontologies are used to enhance and improve the proposed framework.

It is designed to handle non-repetitive processes, where the course of actions has to be decided for each case individually, based on the assessment of the current situation. ACM uses domain-specific data and the analysis of rules to provide the relevant information at the right time to the business users. This supports their actions and decision making but does not dictate predefined workflows that are difficult or even impossible to define for knowledge-intensive work and prevent users from efficiently achieving their goals. Solutions for ACM implementations need to focus on business requirements to support business users rather than limit them by extending existing tools such as content management systems, BPM-based software suites, or collaboration tools with ad hoc development that all lack the ability to adapt flexibly to business level changes without requiring significant IT development efforts. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach by applying business architecture concepts for the definition of ACM applications in combination with domain-specific ontologies and business rules. Business domain analysts describe with the domain-specific ontology the complete value stream with its goals, activities and rules which use a formalized natural business language. The resulting business information model is mapped to an underlying data model and instantly enacted during case execution so that adaptations get immediately available to the business users. The behavioral business rules guide business users to guarantee case compliance which facilitates an easy and rapid adaptation of business applications. We apply this approach to a real life example from the construction industry where several parties from different trades have to collaborate in heterogeneous environments. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Adaptive Case Management; Behavioral Business Rules; Business Process Management; Data based execution; Ontology,Computer hardware description languages; Construction industry; Decision making; Ontology; Building construction projects; Business information modeling; Business process management; Business rules; Case management; Data based execution; Domain-specific ontologies; Heterogeneous environments; Human resource management,Conference Paper

However, building projects often suffer from deviations between planning and reality. In recent years, Building Information Modelling (BIM) has been extended to cover the whole building project life cycle, including the geometric modelling, collaboration mechanisms and building physics information. Although BIM enables the digitization of building planning and operation, the heterogeneity of supporting software, the different procedures of each company involved and the individuality of buildings themselves hinder a seamless collaboration between the parties, making it difficult to trace the impact of decisions. Adaptive Case Management (ACM) is a methodology to handle flexible business processes based on the achievement of business goals during case enactment, without defining strict process models. Therefore BIM management can take advantage of the ACM approach to support the accomplishment of business goals including the traceability between decision making and goal completion, such as compliance with energy-related KPIs. In this paper, we present the first results of applying business architecture principles to ACM for BIM project management that integrates domain-specific BIM tools for the content analysis.

Work space planning involves representing various types of spaces required by construction activities in three dimensions and across time. Since a construction schedule consists of hundreds of activities requiring multiple types of spaces, it is practically impossible to expect project managers to specify manually the spatiotemporal data necessary to represent work spaces in four dimensions. This paper presents mechanisms that automatically generate project-specific work spaces from a generic work space ontology and a project-specific IFC (industry foundation class) based 4D production model. The generation of these work spaces leads to a space-loaded production model. Within this model, work spaces are represented as being related to the relevant construction activities and methods and as having attributes that describe when, where, and how long they exist, and how much volume they occupy. These space-loaded production models enable richer 4D CAD simulations, time-space conflict analysis, and proactive work space planning prior to construction.",Construction methods; Project management; Scheduling; Workspace,Rolling scaffolding; Spatial conflict analysis; Workspace; Computer architecture; Computer simulation; Data acquisition; Mathematical models; Project management; Scheduling; Software prototyping; Construction industry,Article

The state of the art shows how information management can be carried out utilizing information containers employing Semantic Web technologies Resource Description Framework (RDF), SPARQL, and R2RML. The key output is developing a web-based platform that implements ICDD containers for asset management.

The use of existing domain-specific ontologies for infrastructure in combination with the linkage of domain knowledge to a three-dimensional BIM model is a step beyond the state of the art and practice in the construction industry.

But especially in the construction industry, products are often innovative and individually manufactured and previous attempts to depict them with ontologies failed to include meaningful alignments to already existing approaches. Thus, this paper gives an overview of existing product ontologies in general and analyses previous approaches in more detail to identify potential improvements that can be made. Based on this analysis, this paper presents the Building Product Ontology (BPO), including its concepts and alignments. To obtain a modular ontology, the BPO focuses on the non-geometric description without defining templates by determination of taxonomies and includes concepts to model assembly structures, interconnections of components, and complex properties and property values. The BPO enables manufacturers to freely model their products while still benefitting from the Semantic Web in respects of findability and availability of product data.

It enriches the discussion by focusing on one specific sub-domain – the application of digital methods in road design, construction and operation which involves the exchange, management and querying of spatio-semantic data that typically stems from different data sources and involves diverse software systems and data models. It argues that semantic web techniques significantly simplify the integration of heterogeneous data models. In a case study, the German road data exchange standard OKSTRA is linked with the Dutch CB-NL and RWS object type libraries. Doing so, it is shown how nationally well-established and widespread standards can be integrated in order to perform cross-country querying of road data.

In this context the paintings are read as an ontological statement about the complexity and ambiguity of the urban landscape, one which contrasts with historical and contemporary narratives of the urban built environment. The paper posits that knowledges which preserve the complexities and materialities of urban space have the potential to provide political interventions into both historical and contemporary narratives of the city. © The London Journal Trust 2020.",Building site; Frank Auerbach; Leon Kossoff; Painting; Post-War; Reconstruction; Urban Studies,art; complexity; historic building; landscape structure; material culture; memory; post-war; reconstruction; social history; urban area; urban geography; urban history; England; London [England]; United Kingdom,Article

While this method focuses on building data, the distribution of digital product models is still problematic, complicating uniform product searches and automated product data processing. Existing schemas, such as a subpart of the Industry Foundation Classes or the German VDI 3805, rely on rigid or template-driven schemas, that do not support the description of innovative or multi-functional products or impose a large schema overhead and complexity on manufacturers. Therefore, this article combines flexible and modular product descriptions with Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data. By applying Web-based technologies, the searchability of product data and the applicability of distributed data are expected to be enhanced. More precisely, this article proposes a concept for Linked Building Product Data and introduces the generic Building Product Ontology as a potential core schema of the concept. To demonstrate the feasibility of Linked Building Product Data and the Building Product Ontology, the authors apply both the concept and the data schema to innovative and multi-functional example products that cannot be described with the existing approaches for product descriptions. The evaluation demonstrates the flexibility, modularity and overall suitability of the presented concepts, meeting all collected requirements for digital product descriptions. Hence, Linked Building Product Data may solve existing issues with rigid product description schemas.

It suggests building material passports as a data source for the materials to be circulated and then integrates them by means of Linked Data.A common language is proposed to combine and re-use the material data in the CE with the creation of two ontologies: Circular Exchange Ontology (CEO) and the Circular Materials and Activities Ontology (CAMO). The ontologies annotate materials under a CE classification scheme and describe the elements required for material exchange to occur: actors, the activities they perform and the referents of these activities (resources, products, tools and waste).An evaluation of the ontologies is made by means of use case-driven SPARQL queries. Further, a wide-scale evaluation addresses how a decentralized data ecosystem can enable users to publish information and dynamically interact with different repositories to exchange materials.

The drawing of these representations is a time-consuming task, accomplished by manual work by skilled operators who often rely on in-situ analysis and on pictures. In this project three-dimensional an automated method for the condition survey of reinforced concrete spalling has been developed. To realize the automated image-based survey it has been exploited the Mask R-CNN neural network. The training phase has been executed over the original model, providing new examples of images with concrete cover detachments. At the same time, a photogrammetry process involved the images, in order to obtain a point cloud which acts as a reference to a Scan to BIM process. The BIM environment serves as a collector of information, as it owns the ontology to recreate entities and relationships. The information as extracted by neural network and photogrammetry serve to create the pictures which depict the concrete spalling in the BIM environment. A process of projecting information from the images to the BIM recreates the shapes of the pathology on the objects of the model, which becomes a decision support system for the built environment. A case study of a concrete beam bridge in northern Italy demonstrates the validity of the process. © 2019 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

The multifaceted causes of this performance gap are resulting from the misalignment between design assumptions and actual construction processes that take place on-site. In general, critical factors are rooted in the lack of interoperability around the building and work-environment information due to its heterogeneous nature. To overcome the interoperability challenge in safety management, this paper represents the development of an ontological model consisting of terms and relationships between these terms, creating a conceptual information model for construction safety management and linking that ontology to IfcOWL. The developed ontology, named Safety and Health Exchange (SHE), comprises eight concepts and their relationships required to identify and manage safety risks in the design and planning stages. The main concepts of the developed ontology are identified based on reviewing accident cases from 165 Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) and 31 Press Releases from the database of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in the United Kingdom. Consequently, a semantic mapping between the developed ontology and IfcOWL (the most popular ontology and schema for interoperability in the AEC sector) is proposed. Then several SPARQL queries were developed and implemented to evaluate the semantic consistency of the developed ontology and the cross-mapping. The proposed ontology and cross-mapping gained recognition for its innovation in utilising OpenBIM and won the BuildingSMART professional research award 2020. This work could facilitate developing a knowledge-based system in the BIM environment to assist designers in addressing health and safety issues during the design and planning phases in the construction sector. © 2022 The author(s).

We do this by focusing on the concept of Circular Economy. Circular Economy is often presented as a solution to the problems of a globalized economy in the form of over-exploitation of resources, climate change and pollution of the environment. Within the mainstream economics paradigm, the aim is how to increase the effectiveness of resource extraction and utilization in order to maintain growth. We contrast this with the paradigm of Ecological Economics where the goal of the economy is to achieve and secure a higher quality of life. Circular Economy often side steps the deep ontological and epistemological questions we need to answer if we are to address the complex and interrelated environmental, economic and social problems we face today. This can be a limiting factor in the search for creative and long-term solutions. However, within the Circular Economy discourse, we find strands that critically engage with the foundations of mainstream Economics and so, innovative solutions for the society of the future are a possibility. We argue that to bring about a lasting solution to the interconnected social, economic and environmental problems, Circular Economy must engage with the ontological, epistemological and axiological foundations of mainstream economics. To further this argument, we apply Imre Lakatos’ ‘research program’ model to philosophy of science as our framework of analysis and draw lessons for business and communities. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Circular economy; Ecological economics; Lakatos; Quality of life,,Article

We aimed to study the circRNAs expression profiles and their functions in osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Firstly, we established osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs displaying increased mRNA expression of osteogenic differentiation marker (RUNX2, OPN, and OCN), increased ALP activity and protein expression, and increased mineralized nodules formation, as well as morphological alteration. Then, we employed high-throughput sequencing to analyze circRNA expression and found that 3440 and 3893 circRNAs in non-induced and induced groups, respectively. We further validated the 10 differentially expressed circRNAs with the most significant difference between induced and non-induced groups. Among these ten circRNAs, five of them with more than one miRNA binding site were used to construct a ceRNA network exhibiting 81 miRNAs and 182 target mRNAs. Furthermore, among these five circRNAs, we found only circ_0005564 significantly reduced the mRNA expression of RUNX2, OPN, and OCN. The circularity of circ_0005564 was verified. Our results showed that knockdown of circ_0005564 inhibited osteoblast differentiation in BMSCs.

However, the pathological mechanism underlying I/R injury is still not clear. Recent works showed that circular RNAs play critical roles in many human diseases. In this study, the occurrence of liver I/R injury was validated by an analysis of the blood samples and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of liver tissues. Total RNA was purified and followed by RNA-seq in the purpose of screening the circRNAs in significant differentially expression, which were validated by quantitative PCR. GO and KEGG analysis were performed to determine the function of these differentially expressed circular RNAs. The circular structure of the circRNA was validated with gel electrophoresis and RNase R treatment. We found that some circular RNAs were differentially expressed in Liver I/R mouse models through bioinformatics analysis. These circular RNAs play roles in biological process, cellular component, and molecular function through GO analysis. Meanwhile, Hippo signaling pathway was found to be correlated with circular RNAs function in I/R models by KEGG analysis. To further validate bioinformatics data, two up-regulated and three down-regulated circular RNAs were confirmed in I/R models. The circularity of these differentially expressed circular RNAs was validated through gel electrophoresis and RNase R treatment.

Moreover, I note how Searle fails to observe language in reciprocal relation to the institutions which not only are shaped by it but also shape language’s practical applications. According to Searle, social theorists that tried to show a connection between society, culture, and language all failed to see the constitutive role of language in the making of social reality. Consequently, I believe that Searle is himself guilty of a certain kind of blind presumption, and argue that Hegel’s philosophy of culture, which Searle dismisses as implausible, offers a more cohesive account of the normative transactions between human beings and their social world. © 2020 IJSCL.

This paper uses established ontological criteria to review and improve the CE definition and (assessment) frameworks. The review reveals that mainstream CE definitions and assessments are fuzzy, shift problems, oversimplified and not synchronized. This causes many loopholes that not lead towards sustainability. Therefore, an improved definition and framework is proposed, specifically for CE of XL to XS regions (scales from planetary to neighborhoods). A CE should strive towards self-sufficiency on each scale to avoid problems shifting to other regions or future society. The framework elaborates on a comprehensive systems-approach, which connects the triple bottom line across nine ecosystem processes, eight societal processes, and six economic production processes. The proposed definition and framework are demonstrated in an assessment of regional pressures and their impacts of Australia with 2020 data. The framework aims to better inform decision-makers on trade-offs between vital processes to minimize unintended problem shifting.

The importance of classification is growing as building projects become more international, generating more data that rely on automated processes, which help in making better decisions and operating devices. Different classification systems have been developed around the world. Each national construction information classification system (NCICS) aims to classify information on the built environment and thus meet national needs and ensure compliance with the principles of regional and international building information systems. The research purpose of this paper is to present a comparative assessment of two construction information classification systems, CCI and Uniclass 2015. The following methods were used: the expert assessment of NCICS alternatives; the assessment of NCICS alternatives; and a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis of NCICS alternatives. We concluded that in the initial phase of NCICS development, CCI ontologies should be adopted as a base consisting of construction entities, spaces, and elements, with the gradual addition of complexes of buildings and infrastructure, along with roles and phases of the building life cycle (BLC).

In this article, principles of feng shui are selected and formulated to create an evaluation model showing entrance-courtyard relation, building shape, water element, room arrangement, and door alignment and circulation. Based on this evaluation model, the essential aspects of well-being have been revealed through the elements of architecture. In that sense, this article presents the opportunities and possibilies of an ideal plan layout by bringing an awareness to the cosmology and feng shui to achieve well-being.",Being/ontology; Cosmology; Courtyard house; Cyprus-China; Feng shui,,Article

One of the most complex forms in the built environment is tall building because of the scale, design considerations, and multidisciplinary nature. This article discusses development of ontological model for understanding, presenting, relating, and managing knowledge influencing architectural design of tall buildings. Ontology is a knowledge-based model that represents certain domain by abstraction of concepts, and a network of relationships and properties describing these concepts. By creating an architectural ontology, the factors, relations, and characteristics in the design process can be clearly defined and presented. The model incorporates physical systems such as structure, building elements, and geometry, as well as environmental effects, social aspects and other complex attributes. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Architectural design; Complexity; Ontology; Tall building,,Article

As the Inter-Connection Project was developed, the pipeline grew from 3,000 feet to over 12 miles. The modified project allows the transfer of water between two distinct service areas. This pipeline, both eliminated and delayed construction of additional reservoirs in both service areas. Through the utilization of a pipeline, the District optimized their storage capacity of potable water, and increased service reliability to their customers. The project has provided several opportunities for partnerships through the creativity of the District. The District developed a construction philosophy of ""Construction Manager/Constructor"" (CM/C) for the project. The CM/C philosophy employed the construction manager as the general contractor, in a not-at-risk relationship, who in turn was responsible for securing, through public bidding, subcontractors to complete specific aspects of the work. The project was divided into 54 distinct construction contracts, creating increased opportunities for small and local contractors to participate in what has become the single largest capital improvement project undertaken by the District. Since the project is located primarily through undeveloped area, another partnership was created to make the project feasible. An environmental partnership was created with the local, state and federal resource agencies at the project onset. By working closely with the respective agencies, several environmental hurdles, that have been the demise of other projects, were cleared. The District has seen a tremendous benefit from this project through the partnerships developed during design, with the contractors through the CM/C process, and with the community during outreach efforts. This project, which many viewed as impossible, stands as an example of what can be accomplished when partnerships are created to overcome the largest obstacles for projects today, no longer the engineering aspects, but the institutional factors.

Over the last decade corporate team philosophy has shifted the team paradigm away from a traditionally tactical purpose towards an increasingly strategic perspective. The research programme investigates the relationship between construction site management team efficiency and project performance. Ten construction project case-studies have been undertaken to assess levels of site management team working with the results evaluated against project performance. The case-study has two principle data collection methods. The team rating is assessed using an attitude questionnaire completed by all participating site team members. The individual responses are collated, averaged and presented as a percentage rating on a team radar chart. Project performance is calculated by applying Kaplan and Norton's balanced scorecard template together with seven key performance indicators endorsed by the DTi's Constructing Excellence initiative. The KPI's are collated, benchmarked and presented on the appropriate axis of a project radar chart. Analysis of the results suggests a significant strength of relationship between the construction site team rating and project performance. Various statistical configurations have also been identified, indicating possible weaknesses within the team dynamic that may be addressed in an effort to achieve improved project performance.

As such, the identification of pertinent turnaround strategies becomes increasingly important for senior management. Within the strategy-as-practice scholarly, there have been recent calls to move beyond empirical “isolationism” and to connect with other larger social phenomena; while across the turnaround literature there have been calls to explore the process and micro-structure of turnaround strategies in cyclical environments. To address this research gap, the purpose of the study is to adopt a tall ontology by blending the strategy-as-practice lens with the organizational decline and turnaround lens. By drawing on five exploratory case studies of large Irish construction contractors, the central objective is thus to explore firms’ turnaround strategizing practices during an environmental jolt. In order to advance our tall ontology, we developed a turnaround strategizing process model (and propositions) that integrates our findings, and which offers the fundamental building blocks of a new blended theory. We find that successful turnaround attempts entail the simultaneous interaction of non-aggressive cost retrenchment actions and non-extensive internationalization. The case studies further suggest that during a prolonged environmental jolt, cost retrenchment is more often a long-term strategy. Lastly, the findings provide valuable support for practitioners in developing a successful turnaround response, and in aiding the selection and timing of operational and strategic actions. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Internationalization; Ireland; organizational turnaround; retrenchment; strategy-as-practice,Blending; Ontology; Internationalization; Ireland; organizational turnaround; retrenchment; Strategy as practices; Contractors; construction industry; globalization; management; organization; Ireland,Article

Simultaneously, in contemporary architecture new frameworks emerged that have radically redefined the traditional conceptions of design, of the built environment, and of the role of architects. Cybernetic Architectures argues that such frameworks have been constructed in direct reference to cybernetic thinking, a thought model that emerged concurrently with the origins of informatics and that embodies the main assumptions, values, and ideals underlying the development of computer science. The book explains how the evolution of the computational perspective in architecture has been parallel to the construction of design issues in reference to the central ideas fostered by the cybernetic model. It unpacks and explains this crucial relationship, in the work of digital architects, between the use of information technology in design and the conception of architectural problems around an informational ontology.

Information from past mishaps provides an opportunity to acquire insights, gather lessons learned, and systematically improve safety outcomes. Advances in data science and industry 4.0 present new unprecedented opportunities for the industry to leverage, share, and reuse safety information more efficiently. However, potential benefits of information sharing are missed due to accident data being inconsistently formatted, non-machine-readable, and inaccessible. Hence, learning opportunities and insights cannot be captured and disseminated to proactively prevent accidents. To address these issues, a novel information sharing system is proposed utilizing linked data, ontologies, and knowledge graph technologies. An ontological approach is developed to semantically model safety information and formalize knowledge pertaining to accident cases. A multi-algorithmic approach is developed for automatically processing and converting accident case data to a resource description framework (RDF), and the SPARQL protocol is deployed to enable query functionalities. Trials and test scenarios utilizing a dataset of 200 real accident cases confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the system in improving information access, retrieval, and reusability.

Accordingly, an innovative simulation approach based on High Level Architecture (HLA), which is currently used by other industries, is proposed in order to facilitate the building of large-scale models. HLA supports the building of complex simulation models using distributed simulation technology. In this way a large-scale model can be decomposed to facilitate collaboration between various components. The components are independently modeled and executed based on an underlying common object model, which allows for these independent simulation components to become integrated. This underlying structure is known within HLA terminology as the Federation Object Model (FOM). The rules, interactions, and interfaces which are established in FOM allow the components to combine into a coherent simulation. The greater the extent to which FOM is generalized and standardized, the better it facilitates interoperability and reusability of the simulation components. In this paper, in order to realize this goal, the FOM for large-scale industrial construction simulation modeling has been extracted as a subset of multi-perspective domain ontology. Additional roles of domain ontology in the process of Federation development are also explained.",,Common object models; Complex simulations; Discrete-event simulations; Distributed simulations; Domain ontologies; Dynamic natures; Federation development; Federation Object Models; High-level architectures; Industrial constructions; Large-scale models; Multi perspectives; Shared objects; Simulation approaches; Simulation components; Simulation modeling; Civil engineering; Construction equipment; Construction industry; Discrete event simulation; Ontology; Reusability; Terminology; Innovation,Conference Paper

The BC is located approximately 210 m vertically below the lowest SLC level and approximately 1100 m below surface. Due to the mine layout containing a number of common pieces of key infrastructure the activities of both were interlinked. When investigating project construction options for the BC, a number of potential risks were identified including a conflict of priorities between operational and project deliverables and the varying safety and work methods between an owner mining approach in the SLC and a potential contractor workforce in the BC. This led to a review of the construction philosophy and the opportunity to utilise the existing SLC workforce as the basis of all activities in the mine. It was identified that a number of synergies existed with the current SLC operators and mine supervision including common work practices and the opportunity to build on the unique SLC skills of the operators and supervisors which could then be used at other Newcrest caving mines. With the commitment to this philosophy of building on the existing SLC crews and supervision the number of employees reporting through the superintendent underground operations grew from 95 to 245. This increase led to a restructuring of the reporting and work requirements of the superintendent, foremen and shift bosses. In order for the foreman and shift bosses to focus on running the larger crew numbers for the full 12 hour shift the mine superintendent became a pseudo human resources manager taking over all non-mine focused activities including overtime allocation and work and behavioural performance management. In simple terms, ensuring there were competent bums on seats when and where required. As the additional workers were recruited to top up the existing employee numbers, their employment history was used to place them in the most suitable roles. For example, those with building industry experience were placed on the civil construction crews and those with a farming background were used as truck drivers, nippers or on the service crews. To cope with the increased number of new starters a number of key personnel were seconded from the crews into the training group to act as on shift trainers. This initially caused a reduction in mine performance as the main operators were reassigned but it proved a valid move as the time for new operators to reach acceptable levels was significantly reduced with safe operating standards being maintained. This paper discusses how the Ridgeway Deeps Project was delivered on time and under budget whilst at the same time retaining its position globally as an operation to be benchmarked against.",,Building industry; Civil constructions; Operating standards; Performance management; Potential risks; Project construction; Underground operations; Work practices; Work requirements; Caves; Construction industry; Ontology; Personnel training; Truck drivers; Supervisory personnel,Conference Paper

The architecture presents highway knowledge on three levels: domain knowledge (an umbrella for infrastructure shared knowledge), application knowledge (representation of highway-specific knowledge), and user knowledge (an enterprise-specific representation of highway knowledge). The proposed architecture models highway concepts using six major root concepts: project, process, product, actor, resources, and technical topics (attributes and constraints).

However, traditional simulation modeling tools face many limitations in representing large and complex construction processes comprehensively.

Modeling these construction applications within HLA has brought many features to construction simulation; however, such simulation developments are more complicated and time-consuming compared to traditional visual modeling environments. In the present paper it is suggested that developing simulation models through customized environment and employing reusable elements is a more efficient approach for developing models in distributed simulation environments. Furthermore this paper discusses simulation elements identification and development which serve simulation process interaction world-view while providing communication and sharing requirements by distributed simulation modeling.

A comprehensive energy profile of a city, in fact, should work at the city, district, and building levels. At the same time and for each level, it should take into account both electrical and thermal consumptions, and gather these information from a plethora of different sensors and from various stakeholders (i.e., citizens, utilities, policy makers, and energy providers). Current modeling approaches for this context address each level and domain separately, thus preventing a structured and comprehensive approach to a unified energy representation. Moreover, current approaches make it difficult to keep the consistency between the energetic data through levels, sub-domains, and across stakeholders. Starting from an analysis of ontologies at the state-of-the-art, this paper shows how DogOnt can be used as a foundation towards a shared and unified model for such a context.

In particular, I argue that neither of the recently identified regress or circularity problems are troublesome for the supporter of easy ontology if they adopt a holistic account of application conditions. This is not intended to be a defence of easy ontology from all possible objections, but rather to compare holistic and non-holistic versions of the view. This discussion is also significant in that it serves to highlight two distinct forms of easy ontology, which, I argue, need to be distinguished when assessing the merits of the easy approach in future work. © 2021, The Author(s).",,,Article

The thesis defended in this paper is that knowledge of these axioms may be gained by recourse to judgments of probability. While considerations of probability have come to the forefront in recent epistemology, it seems safe to say that the thesis defended here is heterodox from the vantage point of traditional philosophy of mathematics. So this paper focuses on providing a preliminary defense of this thesis, in that it focuses on responding to several objections. Some of these objections are from the classical literature, such as Frege's concern about indiscernibility and circularity (Section 2.1), while other are more recent, such as Baker's concern about the unreliability of small samplings in the setting of arithmetic (Section 2.2). Another family of objections suggests that we simply do not have access to probability assignments in the setting of arithmetic, either due to issues related to the ω-rule (Section 3.1) or to the non-computability and non-continuity of probability assignments (Section 3.2). Articulating these objections and the responses to them involves developing some non-trivial results on probability assignments (Appendix A-Appendix C), such as a forcing argument to establish the existence of continuous probability assignments that may be computably approximated (Theorem 4 Appendix B). In the concluding section, two problems for future work are discussed: developing the source of arithmetical confirmation and responding to the probabilistic liar. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Inductive logic; Peano arithmetic; Philosophy of mathematics,Ontology; Indiscernibility; Inductive logic; Natural number; Non-trivial; Peano arithmetic; Philosophy of mathematics; Probability assignment; Small sampling; Probability,Article

The documents required for payment requests are related to various types of information generated from construction work items. Consequently, construction company needs to spend a lot of efforts to verify and approve the submitted documents in order to record accounts on the ledger. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been used to derive the information for various operations within the construction project. One of the important functions provided by BIM is quantity takeoff. With this capability, BIM can serve as an information platform to provide the information regarding various aggregated amounts of work required to be performed by subcontractors. However, detail information required to process payment requests is still hard to be obtained from the BIM model if no proper development specifications have been established. This study employs ontology and BIM to facilitate the information required to process payment requests and ledger. First, various work items performed by subcontractors are analyzed to identify the information required to process payment requests. Then the relationships between work items and BIM elements are determined through the ontology developed according to the required information identified. Next, a variety of Dynamo modules are applied to develop the BIM model that can provide various types of measurements required by work items.

After 1955, Empson emerged as a leading skeptic of literary “high” modernism by means of the novel analogy argued in his essay, “Donne the Space Man” (1957): namely, that literary depictions of space in Donne’s early poetry, athwart high Church doctrine, paralleled contemporary skepticism, in Empson’s own time, about interpretive orthodoxies within Eliotic criticism and among the American New Critics. With its focus upon what he calls “space travel,” Empson’s exegesis in “Donne the Space Man” (1957) pioneered what today one may call the scalar turn in literary modernist criticism. In Empson’s case, a scalar criticism endorsed Donne’s search for a more generous plurality of critical worlds and embraced cosmological scale irreducible to the more dogmatic worldview of Christian-inspired theorizations then prevailing. Re-reading the “Donne the Space Man” essay today–and when applying approaches inspired by the phenomenology of the contemporary built environment, object-oriented ontology, and unseen “lifeworlds”–allows for a more meaningful treatment of Empson’s criticism in its historical context, and when using scale as an heuristic to broaden our understandings of cosmologies, near and far, vastly different from our own. © 2017 The Author(s).

Explicit semantic analysis (ESA) is a method that automatically extracts concept-based features from human knowledge repositories for semantic retrieval. This avoids the requirement of constructing and maintaining an explicitly formalized ontology. However, since domain-specific knowledge repositories are relatively small, the available terminologies are insufficient and concepts have coarse granularity. In this paper, we propose an enhanced ESA method for product model retrieval in construction industry. The major enhancements for the original ESA method consist of two parts. First, a novel concept expansion algorithm is proposed to solve the problem caused by insufficient terminologies. Second, a reranking algorithm is developed to solve the problem caused by coarse granularity of concepts. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the performance of product model retrieval and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Our method is also applicable to product retrieval in other engineering domain if a specific knowledge repository is provided in that domain. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Building information modeling (BIM); domain knowledge; explicit semantic analysis (ESA); industry foundation classes (IFC); information retrieval (IR),Architectural design; Construction industry; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Terminology; Building Information Model - BIM; Domain knowledge; Domain-specific knowledge; Engineering domains; Explicit semantic analysis; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Specific knowledge; State-of-the-art methods; Semantics,Article

The conversion from EXPRESS to OWL is of particular use to the architectural design and construction industry, because one of the key data models in this domain, namely the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), is represented using the EXPRESS information modelling language. These conversion efforts have by now resulted in a recommended ifcOWL ontology that stays semantically close to the EXPRESS schema. Two major improvements could be made in addition to this ifcOWL basis. First, the ontology could be split into diverse modules, making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology. Second, geometric aggregated data (e.g. lists of coordinates) could be serialised into alternative, less complex semantic structures. The purpose of both improvements is to make ifcOWL data smaller in size and complexity. In this article, we focus entirely on the second topic, namely the optimization of geometric data in the semantic representation. We outline and discuss the diverse available options in optimizing the data representations used. We quantify the impact of these measures on the ifcOWL ontology and instance model size.

While Althusser self-consciously undertook to defend the scientific character of Marxism and so permanently establish it on a firm footing, many of his closest followers eventually exited the Marxian paradigm for a post-structuralism post-Marxism. We will argue that this development was rooted in Althusser's initial procedure as he attempted to ground Marxism's scientificity in an epistemological argument whose main referent was Marxism itself. This initiated a circularity which was ultimately to prove fatal to Althusser's project. Less remarked upon, however, is a further legacy of the Althusserian oeuvre, the critical realist conception of Marxism initiated by Roy Bhaskar. Bhaskar found part of his inspiration in Althusser's successful posing of the question of Marx's science. On the one hand, Althusser's work can legitimately be seen as a bridge into the post-modern challenge to Marxism. On the other hand, it can be seen as clearing the ground and establishing some of the foundation for critical realism's successful recuperation of the scientific character of Marxism. © 2014 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.",Epistemology; Ideology; Marxism; Ontology; Philosophy; Science,,Article

Knowledge management has been hailed as an enabler for tapping this knowledge to improve efficiency in the AEC industry. In this study, the main concepts and benefits of knowledge management, relationships between knowledge management and continuous improvement have been examined. Furthermore, emphasis has been laid on knowledge management through experience feedback processes which constitute valuable assets for the AEC industry. This is done through the employment of ontologies and graph-based reasoning operations in eliciting and visualizing knowledge concepts in the AEC domain. The proposed approach which consists of two main aspects provides the opportunity to examine the conceptual and ontological knowledge models with associated reasoning. In the first, the concepts of knowledge management, their significance and application in the AEC field are discussed. The second deals with a methodological framework for the modeling and reasoning in the domain ontology. To facilitate automation, an ontology graph-based editor, Conceptual Graphs User Interface (CoGui) was used to model knowledge and encoded reasoning in the knowledge base. CoGui encodes knowledge as conceptual graphs and reasoning as graph operations that can be visualized in a logically precise way, based on domain ontologies. It emerged that CoGui could be very useful in acquiring information that can be used in collaboration with others to continuously improve information sharing and re-use.

The circRNAs are important in virus infection process, but whether circRNAs regulated RABV infection remains largely unknown. Here, mice brain with or without the RABV CVS-11 strain were subjected to RNA sequencing and a total of 30,985 circRNAs were obtained. Among these, 9021 candidates were shared in both groups, and 14,610 and 7354 circRNAs were expressed specifically to the control and experimental groups, indicating that certain circRNAs were specifically inhibited or induced on RABV infection. The circRNAs mainly derived from coding exons. In total, 636 circRNAs were dif-ferentially expressed in RABV infection, of which 426 significantly upregulated and 210 significantly downregulated (p < 0.05 and fold change ≥2). The expression of randomly selected 6 upregulated and 6 downregulated circRNAs was tested by RT-qPCR, and the expression trend of the 11 out of 12 circRNAs was consistent in RT-qPCR and RNA-seq analysis. Rnase R-resistant assay and Sanger sequencing were conducted to verify the circularity of circRNAs. GO analysis demonstrated that source genes of all differentially regulated circRNAs were mainly related to cell plasticity and synapse function. Both KEGG and GSEA analysis revealed that these source genes were engaged in the cGMP–PKG and MAPK signaling pathway, and HTLV-I infection. Also, pathways related to glucose metabolism and synaptic functions were enriched in KEGG analysis. The circRNA–miRNA–mRNA network was built with 25 of 636 differentially expressed circRNAs, 264 mRNAs involved in RABV infection, and 29 miRNAs. Several miRNAs and many mRNAs in the network were reported to be related to viral infection and the immune response, suggesting that circRNAs could regulate RABV infection via interacting with miRNAs and mRNAs. Taken together, this study first characterized the transcriptomic pattern of circRNAs, and signaling pathways and function that circRNAs are involved in, which may indicate directions for further research to understand mechanisms of RABV pathogenesis. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, the IFC is extended to describe the geometric information and hierarchy for an MCSRS, based on which an automatic workflow for converting the original design data to the corresponding 3D BIM model complying with IFC standard is developed. To validate the methodology, a real-world case is used for testing the modeling result, in which several different modeling cases between two cross-sections are examined.

However, the little time available for proper project scheduling in the planning and design stage often impairs the quality of a schedule. Few efforts have been made to evaluate and maintain the schedule quality in the construction stage. Usually project teams need to put intensive manual efforts to conduct schedule quality diagnosis which is time-consuming and subjective to a large extent. One major challenge of diagnosing schedule quality is understanding the activity characteristics and construction logic. The multi-partite nature of construction projects (i.e. schedulers and project teams) further exacerbates the difficulty of diagnosis. This paper thus proposes a novel semantic-based logic reasoning and representation methodology to extract construction methods from the schedule to ensure a consistent project schedule. The intellectual contributions of this paper are twofold. First, this paper develops an ontology of tasks with hierarchies from the schedule to automatically extract the construction methods and activities. Second, this paper presents a novel dependency-based information representation schema for representing the logics between tasks and key constraints to facilitate the complete automation in construction logic reasoning from the schedule. To test the proposed system, this paper evaluates the average rate of recall and precision achieved by the system for extracting construction activities and logics in the schedule within one month and compared the results with the rate achieved by manual check. The developed system provides both academics and practitioners a method to detect the deficiencies of project schedules and assists project planners to produce and maintain good quality schedules starting from project initiation until its completion. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Automatic reasoning; Construction knowledge; Construction project; Ontology learning; Schedule quality,Computer circuits; Construction industry; Natural language processing systems; Quality control; Scheduling; Semantics; Automatic reasoning; Construction activities; Construction knowledge; Construction method; Construction projects; Logic reasoning; Ontology learning; Project schedules; Project team; Schedule quality; Ontology,Conference Paper

Active fall protection system (AFPS) is frequently a must in situations where working conditions are difficult and other controls are not feasible or inadequate. However, the design and selection of AFPS are still problematic in the construction industry. This paper aims to develop an online knowledge-based system, FPSWizard, to support the design and selection of AFPS. The hybrid system adopts a combination of case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule-based reasoning (RBR) to improve retrieval performance. FPSWizard is meant to recommend suitable AFPS based on similar past design cases. Potential end users, such as professional engineers and safety professionals, can use the system as a decision support system when they are selecting and designing a solution to the work-at-height problem at hand. A total of fifty stored cases were created based on actual work scenarios and AFPS designs in the construction industry. A case structure was also created using the AFPS-Ontology. The system was assessed using a leave-one-out cross validation approach, where fifty cases in the case base were used to test the retrieval performance of the system. The hybrid CBR-RBR approach had an average positive predictive value (PPV) (or precision) of 90%. In comparison, a pure CBR approach had an average PPV of 76%. FPSWizard forms an important part of an intelligent system which provides comprehensive solutions to fall from height.

In an attempt to do so, in 2011 the UK government made Building Information Modelling (BIM) level 2 a mandate for all public projects by 2016. Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) is a project delivery approach closely attributed to BIM. However, it does not seem to have received proportionate level of attention and uptake in the UK. The research into reciprocal impacts of BIM and IPD are few and far between and non-existent in the UK construction context. This research investigates if and how IPD can facilitate BIM implementation in the UK. Capitalizing on relativist ontology, the study uses a mixed methodology to gauge industry experts' perception of the barriers to BIM implementation and uptake and the barriers to what constitutes IPD principles based on what has been found in the literature. The research findings support the hypothesis that IPD does help overcome barriers to collaboration, improve early involvement of the key participants and enhance the level of trust among key stakeholders; thereby helping eliminate the barriers to implementation of BIM. The research has also identified the main barriers to implementing IPD, which if overcome, could improve construction performance in terms of cost, time, efficiency and productivity in the UK by defragmenting parties through its multi-party agreement structure, facilitating BIM, enhancing parties’ early involvement and collaboration through its inherent BIM contractual principles. The findings suggest that IPD can facilitate better and wider uptake of BIM in the UK construction industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",BIM implementation; Building information modelling; Integrated project delivery; IPD facilitation; Project delivery methods,Construction industry; Information theory; Project management; BIM implementation; Building Information Modelling; Integrated project deliveries; IPD facilitation; Project delivery method; Architectural design,Article

Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The building and construction domain is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information between actors. For example, semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, are problems fundamentally created through the employment of representations to map the ‘world’ into models in an endeavour to anticipate different actors’ views, vocabulary, and objectives. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work is the process of formalization and representation of document content, where most existing approaches are limited in their capability and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched by incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (the Semantic Associations) modelled by domain ontologies combined with the information presented in documents, thereby providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework for representation of knowledge sources, where each knowledge source is semantically represented (within its domain of use) by a Semantic Vector. This work contributes to the enrichment of Semantic Vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support, employing ontology concepts and their relations in the enrichment process. The test bed for the assessment of the approach is the Building and Construction industry, using an appropriateB&CdomainOntology. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications.

FEED phase scope generally covers the basic design and engineering of the facilities, development of the layout, vendor inputs for major packages, HSE impact assessment and refines the cost estimates of the conceptual design. The FEED cost estimates are used to obtain required management approvals and also serve as basis to review the proposal of the Engineering, Procurement & Construction (EPC) contractors. The FEED dossier, which is a compilation of basic design and engineering documents, is provided to the EPC contractor to serve as input data for further detailing during the EPC phase and forms a part of contract documentation. Historically, the EPC contractor scope included performing the detailed design and engineering based on the FEED documents and in case of any conflicts or changes in design philosophy, the issues were referred to FEED contractor for resolution. FEED Contractor's scope encompassed providing process guarantees on the system design and corrective engineering wherever applicable. More recently, with the emergence of the FEED endorsement concept, a single point responsibility is passed on to the EPC Contractor to be fully responsible for the delivery of the project, meeting all requirements and without any involvement of the FEED contractor. EPC contractors are required to endorse the FEED at the time of bidding and take full responsibility of the project including process guarantees, in addition to the normal warranties/guarantees associated with usual EPC project scope. This concept is quite advantageous in terms of Owner's project execution strategy, however, brings additional challenges and responsibilities to the EPC Contractors. In essence, the FEED Endorsement requires understanding of the complete design concept and complete verification of design without any face to face interaction with Owner or the FEED contractor. It is worth noting that FEED endorsement requires significant efforts for design verification and includes redoing many basic design activities such as process simulations, system hydraulics and other calculations within a short period. Often, additional requirements get added to the project scope during tender clarifications/FEED endorsement phase enlarging the original scope. Such requirements added through the tender bulletins are generally not engineered and sometimes are not even aligned with FEED documents. Resolution of such issues during tendering stage often remains inconclusive. Since Owners do not generally entertain ""exceptions"" to the scope of works during bidding stage, contractors have no option except to take an appropriate risk and accordingly price the project. Owner project teams including Project Management Consultant (PMC) involved during FEED phase do not essentially continue to the bidding/EPC phase. Due to this, the responses to the clarifications raised by EPC contractors are sometimes not consistent with FEED philosophy and are influenced by the new PMC team approach. Experience further indicates that sometimes the FEED is not complete and many vital design issues resulting from material and corrosion studies, pipeline design studies, critical safety studies etc, are not closed during the FEED stage. Even equipment layouts are without adequate project specific inputs particularly from safety and vendors. The specifications for long lead items which are vital for ever demanding schedules are not well defined to a stage where these can be ready for ordering. The utility packages are found often undersized and require significant re-work during EPC phase. It is impractical for EPC Contractors to fully verify and allow for such short falls during the brief EPC bidding period. National Petroleum Construction Company (NPCC) is a large EPC contracting company in the region, engaged in executing mega Oil & Gas projects, both onshore and offshore. NPCC have handled many onshore/offshore oil and gas projects and experienced a variety of challenges during FEED verification/endorsement stage. Based on these experiences, this paper attempts to discuss some of the challenges EPC Contractors face during the FEED verification process and proposes a way forward for effectively handling the same. The paper discusses these issues in detail with some typical examples from the projects executed in the recent past.

We investigate the LbL formation of multilayer films composed of polymers of biological origin (poly(l-lysine) (PLL) and dextran sulfate (DS)), the adsorption of fibronectin (Fn)-a matrix protein known to promote cell adhesion-onto these films, and the subsequent spreading behavior of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). We employ optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) and quartz crystal microgravimetry with dissipation (QCMD) to characterize multilayer assembly in situ, and find adsorbed Fn mass on PLL-terminated films to exceed that on DS terminated films by 40%, correlating with the positive charge and lower degree of hydration of PLL terminated films. The extent and initial rate of Fn adsorption to both PLL and DS-terminated films exceed those onto the bare substrate, indicating the important role of electrostatic complexation between negatively charged protein and positively charged PLL at or near the film surface. We use phase-contrast optical microscopy to investigate the time-dependent morphological changes of HUVEC as a function of layer number, charge of terminal layer, and the presence of Fn. We observe HUVEC to attach, spread, and lose circularity on all surfaces. Positively charged PLL-terminated films exhibit a greater extent of cell spreading than do (negatively charged) DS-terminated films, and spreading is enhanced while circularity loss is suppressed by the presence of adsorbed Fn. The number of layers plays a significant role only for DS-terminated films with Fn, where spreading on a bilayer greatly exceeds that on a multilayer, and PLL-terminated films without Fn, where initial spreading is significantly higher on a monolayer. We observe initial cell spreading to be followed by retraction (i.e. decreased cell area and circularity with time) for films without Fn, and for DS-terminated films with Fn. Overall, the Fn-coated PLL monolayer and the Fn-coated PLL-terminated multilayer are the best performing films in promoting cell spreading. We conclude the presence of Fn to be an important factor (more so than film charge or layer number) in controlling the interaction between multilayer films and living cells, and thus to represent a promising strategy toward in vivo applications such as tissue engineering. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This combinatory approach argues for reflexivity as an epistemic criterion of ontological coherence, which suggests that social ontologies should account for the possibility of self-reflective subjectivity – for otherwise they result in a paradoxical conclusion according to which a social scientist reflects on her or his ontological commitments even though these commitments deny her or him the capacity for self-reflection. This analysis presupposes that all human sciences are categorically premised on social ontologies; and it argues for an analytical distinction between self-reflection, which refers to the agential capacity for reflecting on one’s own commitments, and the epistemic criterion of reflexivity hereby proposed.

In its contextualism and critique of metanarratives, I approach postmodernism as a form of local knowledge, characterized as knowledge inevitably framed through the here of our collective presence and the now of our collective interests. Knowledge in short is group-centred, and chronocentric in its privileging of the current. This argument is extended to the idea and practice of modernism in the built environment, and contrasted with a postmodernism that reflexively works from an epistemology and ontology of the local. I suggest that lessons drawn from a critical postmodernism, emanating from the social movements of the 1965-75 period, have had constructive results in the built environment. As such, the legacy of postmodernism should not be forgotten as its life cycle seemingly draws to a close.",Built environment; Chronocentricity; Localism; Modernism; Postmodernism; Social space,human geography; post-modernism; social movement,Article

Different automatic or semiautomatic extraction techniques have been proposed for building domain ontology in recent years. The correctness of the extracted ontology, however, has often been ignored or not verified formally. With increasingly complex and sophisticated realworld domains, the issue of correctness and verification of ontology is becoming more important. This chapter proposes a formal technique for ontology representation and its verification, based on State Controlled Coloured Petri Net (SCCPN), which is a high level net combining Coloured Petri Net and State Controlled Petri Net. It provides the capability of detection and identification of potential anomalies in ontology. We first describe the formal representation of ontology by SCCPN. The definition of SCCPN for modeling ontologies and the mapping between them are presented in detail. Moreover, the ontology inference in SCCPN is also formulated with specified inference mechanisms. After modeling ontology by SCCPN, the formal verification of potential anomalies (including redundancy, circularity and contradiction) is discussed. It is based on the reachable markings generated by transition firings in the Petri nets. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

This involves the formal semantics of these languages which is typically based on a limited set of abstract mathematical notions. In this paper, we discuss the interplay between formal semantics and the intended role of ontologies as semantic foundation. In this connection a circularity is identified if ontologies are to determine the conceptual equivalence of expressions. This is particularly relevant for ontologies which are to be provided in multiple formalisms. In order to overcome this situation, ontological semantics is generally defined as a novel kind of semantics which is purely and directly based on ontological entities. We sketch a specific application of this semantics to the syntax of first order logic. In order to beneficially rely on theoretical results and reasoning systems, an approximation of the proposed semantics in terms of the conventional approach is established. This results in a formalization method for first order logic and a translation-based variant of ontological semantics. Both variants involve an ontology for their application. In the context of developing a top-level ontology, we outline an ontology which serves as a meta-ontology in applying ontological semantics to the formalization of ontologies. Finally, resolved and remaining issues as well as related approaches are briefly discussed. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

Resequencing activities require planners to determine the impact or ""role"" an activity has on successor activities. They also need to determine the status of activities, i.e., which activities may or may not be delayed. Distinguishing the role and status of activities in turn requires planners to understand the rationale for activity sequences. The current critical path method (CPM) framework, however, represents sequencing rationale using precedence relationships and distinguishes activities only with respect to their time-criticality. Thus, planners find it difficult to keep track of individual sequencing logic, and manually inferring the role and status of activities becomes practically prohibitive in complex project schedules. The research presented in this paper addressed this limitation of the CPM framework by formalizing a constraint ontology and classification mechanism. The ontology allows planners to describe their rationale for activity sequences in a consistent and intuitive way, whereas the classification mechanism leverages the ontology to automatically infer the role and status of activities. The ontology and mechanisms were implemented in a prototype tool. With this tool, users can quickly verify which activities to delay to expedite critical milestone or bottleneck activities, thus making it possible to quickly evaluate and generate sequencing alternatives in CPM-based schedules. © 2007 ASCE.",Computer Aided Scheduling; Constraints; Construction management; Critical Path Methods,Complex project schedules; Construction managements; Critical Path Methods; Successor activities; Computer aided software engineering; Constraint theory; Critical path analysis; Engineering research; Formal logic; Ontology; Project management; Software prototyping; Construction industry,Article

To create complete as-built models, these methods require the visual sensors to have proper line-of-sight and field-of-view to building elements. For reporting progress deviations, they also require Building Information Modeling (BIM) and schedule Work-Breakdown-Structure (WBS) with high Level of Development (LoD). While certain logics behind sequences of construction activities can augment 4D BIM with lower LoDs to support making inferences about states of progress under limited visibility, their application in visual monitoring systems has not been explored. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes an ontology that models construction sequencing rationale such as physical relationships among components. It also presents a classification mechanism that integrates this ontology with BIM to infer states of progress for partially and fully occluded components. The ontology and classification mechanism are validated using a Charrette test and by presenting their application together with BIM and as-built data on real-world projects. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed ontology. It also illustrates how the classification mechanism augments 4D BIM at lower LoDs and WBS to enable visual progress assessment for partially and fully occluded BIM elements and provide detailed operational-level progress information. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, for example, are problems fundamentally originated through the employment of representations to map the 'world' into models in an endeavor to anticipate other actors' views, vocabulary, and even motivations. In this paper, the role of information technologies, actors, and representations is first presented within a framework of communication with the purpose of further illustrating the encountered problems in interrelating sources of information. Secondly, interoperability is examined within the context of interrelating sources of information. This explanation supports the claim that the description of concepts into some form of representation does not guarantee the understanding by other members of the community of what is described. Thirdly, an illustration of semantic reconciliation is presented through an engineering example. An approach to semantically reconcile representations is proposed through the study of the internal role of the representations. The research assumption is that if the internal role of a representation is recognized, the treatment of the conveyed semantics can be facilitated, revealing important aspects of the meanings to provide proper understanding during the transition from the source to the interpreter. Particularly, this investigation searches for the fundamental problems of semantically reconciling sources, and introduces theoretical notions from other disciplines to suggest alternative approaches for the encountered problems. Our contribution is to provide clarification of the challenge of reconciling information and to bring attention to the need for further research on the relationship of actors as social subjects and on the representation of information to the community. We anticipate the inclusion of this relationship in the research efforts will lead to a more effective sharing, exchanging, integrating, and communication of information among actors through the employment of IT. © 2011 The authors.",Communication; Conceptual models; Conceptual role semantics; Ontology; Semantics,Alternative approach; Conceptual model; Conceptual schemas; Construction projects; Fundamental problem; Integrating information; Research efforts; Semantic gap; Semantic reconciliation; Technical levels; Communication; Construction industry; Employment; Information technology; Ontology; Research; Semantics,Article

Comprising a centralized database of all relevant information for the entire bridge stock and analytics to forecast bridges' condition and maintenance cost, BMSs are irreplaceable tools, used by all the National Road Authorities (NRAs) around the world. These powerful tools, although different from one another, all lack adequate visualization of bridges. Recently, numerous researcher proposed using the Building Information Models (BIMs) to address this issue. This paper presents the geometric approach of introducing BIM to BMS. Rather than trying to thoroughly connect these two robust systems on the object definition level, this approach focuses on geometry. The paper firstly shows how all the inventory information from BMS can be associated with corresponding BIM objects. Afterward, the ways to include the condition assessment data into BIM are proposed. Once the basics of the geometric approach are explained, the example of connecting BIM with BMS is presented. The example is based on KUBA, the Swiss BMS. Finally, the feasibility, as well as the challenges of the presented approach are analyzed. The analysis focused on two important questions.

The rapid spread of opportunistically pathogenic carbapenemase-encoding bacteria (CEB) requires clinicians, researchers, and policy-makers to swiftly find solutions to reduce transmission rates and the associated health burden. Epidemiological data is key to planning control measures. Our study aims to contribute by providing an analysis of 397 unique CEB isolates detected in a tertiary hospital in Germany. We propose new findings on demographic variables to support preventive sanitary precautions in routine clinical practice. Data on detected CEB was combined with patient’s demographic and clinical information for each isolate. Multiple regression techniques were applied to estimate the predictive quality of observed differences. Our findings confirm the role of age and gender in CEB colonization patterns and indicate a role for ethnicity and domicile. Also, carbapenemase-encoding A. baumannii was most frequently introduced to the hospital, while the risk of colonization with VIM-encoding P. aeruginosa rose with the length of hospital stay. P. aeruginosa remains an important complication of prolonged hospital stays. The strong link to hospital-wastewater may have implications for hospital-built environments. A. baumannii can be efficiently controlled from spreading at hospital admission. OXA-encoding CEB being harder to detect in routine screening, targeted preventive measures, such as culture media selective for carbapenem-resistant bacteria, would be opportune for patients from selected regions. The CEB differences linked to ethnicity found in our study may further be supporting the tailoring of diagnostic approaches, as well as health policies upon confirmation by other studies and a better understanding of their global distribution. © Copyright © 2021 Neidhöfer, Buechler, Neidhöfer, Bierbaum, Hannet, Hoerauf and Parčina.",antibiotic resistance screening; carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales; carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae; carbapenem-resistant Gram negative bacteria; carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa; carbapenemases,antibiotic agent; bacterial enzyme; beta lactamase AmpC; carbapenemase; quinolone derivative; antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; beta lactamase; carbapenemase; adult; age; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial colonization; bacterium culture; bacterium identification; bacterium isolate; carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae; clinical practice; controlled study; ethnicity; female; gender; gene ontology; geographic distribution; health care policy; hospital; hospital admission; human; Klebsiella oxytoca; Klebsiella pneumoniae; length of stay; major clinical study; male; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; middle aged; molecular epidemiology; multidrug resistance; nonhuman; prevalence; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; risk factor; Staphylococcus aureus; tertiary care center; Acinetobacter baumannii; epidemiology; ethnic group; genetics; Germany; microbial sensitivity test; Acinetobacter baumannii; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Lactamases; Ethnic Groups; Germany; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Article

This is partly due to policies by various governments requiring existing and new buildings to comply with certain standards or regulations. However, the verification of whether a building complies with any particular standard or regulation has proven challenging in practice. The purpose of formal verification is to prove that under a certain set of assumptions, a building will adhere to a certain set of requirements, for example the minimum performance standards of key environmental issues. Compliance checking requires different criteria often difficult to straightforwardly define and combine in an integrated fashion for providing holistic interpretation to facilitate easy decision-making. Such criteria, their various flows and combinations can easily be dealt with using conceptual graph theories and Semantic Web concepts which allow rules to be imbued to facilitate reasoning. The aim of this study is to tap on conceptual graphs and Semantic Web concepts to develop a system for checking Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM) sustainability standard compliance in the French construction industry. A conceptual graph-based framework that formally describes BREEAM requirements and visually analyse compliance checking processes has been proposed. When implemented in a software that integrates conceptual graphs and Semantic Web knowledge, automatic reasoning allows both the logical specification and the visual interpretation to be displayed and further provides a semantic support for compliance checking information. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Building; Data; Information; Knowledge; Reasoning; Sustainability,Buildings; Construction industry; Decision making; Flow graphs; Formal verification; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Regulatory compliance; Semantic Web; Sustainable development; Building research establishment environmental assessments; Construction projects; Data; Information; Knowledge; Logical specifications; Performance standards; Reasoning; Compliance control; article; building industry; decision making; ontology; semantic web; software,Article

ADCO's basis for developing oil and gas facilities used to be site/field specific. This resulted in inconsistencies in plants' operating and maintenance requirements, as part of ADCO's continual improvement process it was decided to develop a document that reflects the basis for future developments. ADCO therefore developed HSE Philosophy guidelines for engineering design and construction contractors on the over-arching principles to be included in preparing a project specific HSE Philosophy covering operation, maintenance and abandonment plans of any facility. Each project must have a specific HSE Philosophy developed by project teams at conceptual stages outlining the basic corporate philosophies to be adopted. The design contractors further expand and detail the Project HSE Philosophy, incorporating their strategy based upon the generic and corporate philosophies. The principal objectives of an HSE Philosophy are to: Define the basis for a project to ensure a safe, risk based approach to design is achieved, thus minimizing the possibility of injury to personnel and public from the consequences of an accidental event. Provide guidance in selection of equipment and design. Define the design approach to be followed in accordance with Best Available Techniques (BAT) with pollution prevention controls. Control environmental impacts of projects. Optimize usage of natural resources on a sustainable basis. Ensure design achieves demonstrable levels of As Low As Reasonably Practicable 'ALARP'. Ensure compliance with relevant HSE regulations, standards and codes of practice. By following the HSE Philosophy all new ADCO facilities are being developed and operated to a consistent standard.

The simulation of construction operations has been a growing field of research over the last several decades. Since the introduction of the first simulation system, which was based on the activity cycle diagram paradigm of modeling, numerous additional tools have been introduced, each building on and expanding the modeling and analytical capabilities of previous approaches. However, despite such rich body of knowledge, which by now is expanding into areas such as visualization, animation, and virtual reality applications for construction project management, the beneficial application of simulation in practice has been marginal. This paper describes both historical and practical reasons for this situation and presents an ontology-based approach that can harness existing information in construction project management, especially the scheduling function, and has the potential to significantly improve its operational planning and optimization. © 2008 IEEE.",,Activity cycle diagrams; Body of knowledge; Construction operations; Construction project managements; Construction simulations; Decision supports; Graphical representations; Ontology-based; Operational planning; Scheduling functions; Simulation systems; Animation; Construction industry; Decision support systems; Ontology; Scheduling; Virtual reality; Planning,Conference Paper

I argue that history gives us an exemplary form of a chiastic relation and that Merleau-Ponty presages his later ontology of flesh when he investigates the paradox of thinking history. In brief, the paradox is this: history takes on significance only in light of a given reflection on it (just as the world is disclosed only by means of a given body). At the same time, ""the given reflection"" is overlaid and shot through with historical meaning and is nothing but the result of a historical inheritance (just as the body is bound up with the world and is nothing apart from it). I claim that, for Merleau-Ponty, to think history is to think that which is external to oneself and that which one is, in a deferred simultaneity or ""circularity"" that can be called chiastic. © 2018.

However, little is known about the process by which this occurs and how effectively this happens. These questions are addressed by an exploration of how individual hospital stakeholders learn about the performance of their facilities and share these lessons in the adaptation of future hospital disaster management plans. More specifically, the evidence of behavioural and social/collective learning is investigated amongst hospital stakeholders during EWEs. The data gathered from a case study of a major hospital network of four hospitals were qualitatively analysed within a constructionist ontology and interpretivist epistemology using causal loop diagrams (CLDs). This revealed how lessons were learned in the hospital network from collective stakeholder EWEs’ experiences. The findings highlight the need to develop appropriate processes and structures to capture, share and use facilities-related knowledge and embed new lessons learnt into future hospital disaster planning processes.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-based search and ranking algorithm within a generic framework that retrieves the data in the form of a novel augmented data structure for query answers, which we call hybrid molecules. The latter consist of well-defined subgraphs representing relevant contextual information regarding domain-specific information coupled with structural information related to the document. This improves the search results and reduces users' efforts in tracking and interpreting them.

Currently existing data exchange problems between different software applications is adversely impacting the overall productivity of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. The use of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) has been proposed to help address the lack of interoperability throughout construction industry. But the IFC specification itself is too complicated for normal users without special training. This paper proposes a semantic Web Services framework utilizing IFC-based industry ontology to address the interoperability problem. First, the possibility of building an IFC-based construction industry ontology is reviewed. Then, a framework to build semantic Web Services on this ontology is suggested. Both a core service and an assistant service is included. The framework could be easily expanded as long as the same Web Services model and the common ontology is observed. Once implemented, the framework could be utilized by any IFC-supported BIM applications, as well as personnel without extensive knowledge of IFC specifications, for more precise, consistent and up-to-date project information retrieval.

Nevertheless, BIM standards, such as industry foundation classes, are still in the pipeline for infrastructure management.

Among these efforts, the Toyota way model is viewed as an appropriate approach that pinpoints various aspects of lean, covering long-term philosophy, process, people and partners, and problem solving. Adopting the Toyota way model, this paper investigates the impact of the implementation of Toyota way on the quality and productivity performance of large construction firms in China. Based on the fieldwork involving a questionnaire survey conducted in China, stepwise regression was used to determine which of the Toyota way-style practices lead to predictors of project quality and productivity. This paper provides insights for improving the implementation of the Toyota way in the construction industry. The results show that different practices may affect specific performance measures. Chinese construction firms should therefore prioritize resources and efforts to implement the critical principles identified to enhance performance. For example, if construction firms in China wish to focus on project quality achievement, the critical factors are as follows: be responsible for products, employees, and society (from the philosophy model); the project manager plans the work with input from other parties; reject defective materials, components, and equipment; the workplace follows 5S principles (from the process model); work with partners to improve project effectiveness; take part in partners' production process (from the people and partner model); and conduct kaizen activities (from the problem-solving model). © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",China's construction industry; Large firms; Productivity; Quality; Stepwise regression; Toyota way principles,Human resource management; Image quality; Ontology; Productivity; Construction firms; Large firms; Performance measure; Production process; Productivity performance; Questionnaire surveys; Stepwise regression; Toyota way principles; Construction industry,Article

However, it is difficult to find those regulations and codes most relevant to a particular decision, even though they are now in digital form, and often available online. The focus of this work is to map regulations and codes to existing industry-specific taxonomies that would improve their access and retrieval and facilitate their integration with application programs. Keyword matching is a commonly used technique for mapping from a single taxonomy to a single regulation. In this paper, we examine techniques to address two other mapping problems: from a single taxonomy to multiple regulations and from multiple taxonomies to a single regulation. Those techniques - Cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient, and market basket analysis - provide metrics for measuring the similarity between concepts from different taxonomies. We discuss these metrics and provide evaluations using examples from the building industry. These examples illustrate the potential regulatory benefits from the mapping between various taxonomies and regulations. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.",Heterogeneous ontologies; Regulation retrieval; Relatedness analysis; Taxonomy interoperability,,Article

Accidents increase costs and construction time. Accordingly, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has relevant safety regulations for the construction industry. Integration of construction safety strategies into the design phase can prevent potential safety hazards. Most accidents occurring in this field are falling from the roof. Therefore, this paper has narrowed the scope of this study to falls from the roof and has developed the knowledge modeling based on the safety rules provided by OSHA. To apply safety rules at the design stage automatically, safety knowledge or information must first be understandable by the computers. In this study, the knowledge system was developed through ontology modeling using the ontology editing program Protégé. The developed ontology model has two superclasses. These include information on building components based on the most widely used building information modeling program, and knowledge about roof-related safety rules provided by OSHA. The safety plan must include safety accidents and rules as well as their countermeasures associated with the components at the design stage. This paper is the first step to safety management at the design stage, which is the development of ontology modeling so that software can recognize and understand the construction safety knowledge and information. Beginning with this modeling, if there is a potential risk of violating rules related to construction safety requirements, all relevant safety controls are carried out at the design stage. In other words, the design will be completed, and the safety management plan will be finished before construction starts so that the accidents will be prevented during construction. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Accidents; Construction industry; Occupational risks; Ontology; Personnel; Roofs; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction fields; Construction safety; Construction time; Occupational safety and health administrations; Potential safety hazards; Prevention of falls; Safety regulations; Accident prevention,Conference Paper

Processes are defined within corporate operating standards by the most sophisticated firms, but research studies confirm that they are not implemented consistently from project to project. It is well established from statistical analysis of hundreds of projects that improved process conformance and improved interoperability are correlated with substantial improvements in project performance in terms of cost, schedule, and productivity. Process conformance in many industry sectors such as health care, manufacturing, and banking has been radically improved with automation and integration of processes via workflow engines. In the construction industry, data interoperability has substantially been improved over the years with employment of data modeling techniques and standards. Process interoperability which enables inter-organizational communication between project stakeholders in large-scale construction projects is relatively less developed. This paper introduces the concept of Industry Foundation Processes (IFP), and discusses its development and applications. IFP is a unique process modeling system that facilitates integration of core processes of known best practices in the construction industry into workflow management systems, and improves process conformance and interoperability. IFP processes are defined as structured workflow processes based on known best practices in the construction industry, with specific features and properties that comprise the IFP ontology: version, scope, core structure, abstraction level, data structures, recommended practices, workflow inheritance, conformance, and interoperability. In addition, this paper offers an implementation framework for the IFP system, and describes how IFP processes can be customized to more detailed processes suitable to particular types of projects, and then to specific projects, and how the IFP ontology facilitates improved process conformance and interoperability in the domain of the construction industry. © CSCE-CRC International Construction Specialty Conference 2017 - Held as Part of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering Annual Conference and General Meeting 2017.All rights reserved.",,Construction industry; Interoperability; Ontology; Work simplification; Construction project management; Construction projects; Data interoperability; Development and applications; Inter-organizational; Process interoperability; Recommended practice; Workflow management systems; Project management,Conference Paper

The study takes a critical view on the claimed advantages of non-conventional, innovative project procurement strategies as integration-enhancing mechanisms at the project level. Taking a swimming pool construction project governed by an innovative procurement procedure known as 'two-stage tender' as a case in point, the paper evaluates the extent to which better project team integration has been achieved in this context. Two major concerns emerged from the case study analysis: (1) two-stage tendering is an incomplete solution to tensions, adversarial culture and a lack of genuine cooperation over time; and (2) there is a need for facilitating mechanisms of a different nature to support and sustain collective situated learning and shared understanding of longer-term benefits of collaborative work. Based on the theoretical considerations and the interpretation of the empirical accounts, the paper proposes and refines a conceptual framework for understanding the complexity of construction projects as social settings. In the light of this framework, alternative concepts and skills for enhanced collaborative interaction among participating parties in this kind of social setting are suggested. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.",Collaboration; Complexity; Construction project; Interaction; Management skills; Organizational change; Project dynamics; Project management; Team integration; Two-stage tender,Computational complexity; Computer supported cooperative work; Construction industry; Collaboration; Complexity; Construction project; Interaction; Management skills; Organizational change; Project dynamics; Team integration; Two-stage tender; Project management,Review

An ontology-based approach is used to manage and centralize the knowledge across the different stages of this methodology. Feasible combinations of operations lead to processing routes connecting waste with products and the paths are assessed to pre-select the most suitable ones. Then, the network is optimized, and a set of configurations are obtained in order to maximize economic profit and minimize environmental impact. The performance of the proposed framework is illustrated through a case study for the treatment of mixed plastic waste. Results show how pyrolysis-based treatments lead to suitable options according to some specified objectives but also reveal the main drawbacks and conditions that these treatments should improve.

Architecture, engineering, and construction industry spends time and money to solve the information sharing and interoperability issues between different domains. With the advent of building information modeling, a 3D CAD model of a project is used as a shared knowledge resource during the design, construction, and facility management phases of a project's life cycle. Currently, 4D models are created by combining CAD and schedule information. A 4D model is useful for detecting potential construction conflicts during the project planning and design and a valuable tool during construction. However, creating 4D models requires a great amount of human involvement. An approach that facilitates integrating BIM and schedule information can improve efficiency and is highly desirable. This paper presents a new approach to information modeling using the Semantic Web technology. The Semantic Web provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that allows computers to access and combine information distributed over the Internet. The paper discusses: (1) ontologies that the authors have developed for BIM and project schedule information; (2) how ontologies are used for creating project knowledge bases in RDF/OWL format; and (3) how project knowledge bases can facilitate machine processing of project information and semantic interoperability among project knowledge bases. The Semantic Web approach allows information to be saved once at the provider source and be used by authorized users as needed. This means BIM information is created and maintained by designers and project schedule is created and maintained by schedulers on their respective servers. This would allow the latest BIM and project schedule information to be accessed over the Internet and combined for various purposes. © ASCE.",,"Architectural design; Budget control; Computer aided design; Construction industry; Information analysis; Information management; Information theory; Information use; Internet; Interoperability; Life cycle; Office buildings; Semantic Web; Architecture , engineering , and constructions; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction projects; Information Modeling; Project informations; Semantic interoperability; Semantic web approach; Semantic Web technology; Project management",Conference Paper

People may be functionally limited, but this becomes a disability only when they engage with their immediate social and physical environments. Any attempt to address issues of mobility in relation to people with disabilities should be grounded in an ontology that encompasses this understanding. Purpose: The objective of this study is to provide a methodology to integrate the social and physical environments in the development of a mobility ontology for people with motor disabilities (PWMD). Methods: We propose to create subclasses of concepts based on a Nature-Development distinction rather than creating separate social and physical subclasses. This allows the relationships between social and physical elements to be modelled in a more compact and efficient way by specifying them locally within each entity, and better accommodates the complexities of the human-environment interaction as well. Based on this approach, an ontology for mobility of PWMD considering four main elements–the social and physical environmental factors, human factors, life habits related to mobility and possible goals of mobility–is presented. Conclusions: We demonstrate that employing the Nature-Development perspective facilitates the process of developing useful ontologies, especially for defining the relationships between the social and physical parts of the environment. This is a fundamental issue for modelling the interaction between humans and their social and physical environments for a broad range of applications, including the development of geospatial assistive technologies for navigation of PWMD.Implications for rehabilitation The proposed perspective may actually have much broader interests beyond the issue of disability–much of the interesting dynamics in city development arises from the interaction between human-developed components–the built environment and its associated entities–and natural or organic components. The proposed approach facilitates the process of developing useful ontologies, especially for defining the relationships between the social and physical parts of the environment. This is a fundamental issue for modeling the interaction between human -specially people with disabilities -and his social and physical environments in a broad range of domains and applications, such as Geographic Information Systems and the development of geospatial assistive technologies for navigation of people with disabilities, respectively. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",disability; GIS; mobility; Ontology; physical environment; social environment,construction work and architectural phenomena; disabled person; environment; human; rehabilitation; self help device; social environment; social participation; Architectural Accessibility; Disabled Persons; Environment; Humans; Self-Help Devices; Social Environment; Social Participation,Article

However, without considering the human dimension, technologies alone do not necessarily guarantee high performance in buildings. Occupant behavior is a leading factor influencing energy use in buildings. To investigate and quantify the human dimension in a building's energy use, an international research study has been launched as part of project ANNEX66, organized by the International Energy Agency using an interdisciplinary framework. The framework is a synthesis of theories from building physics and social psychology including social cognitive theory, the theory of planned behavior, and the drivers-needs-actions-systems ontology for energy-related behaviors. As a research tool, an online survey was designed to collect cross-country responses from office occupants among 14 universities within 6 countries from 4 continents.

For upcoming, new approaches to store building data, such as the Semantic Web, no universal common agreement exists on the combination of geometric and non-geometric data. It can therefore be unclear to users on how to represent their geometries, leading to a decelerated application and advancement of making building data available over the web. This gap can only be bridged if a common approach on the representation of geometries on the web is achieved. To first generate a common understanding of geometry representations, an overview of existing and developing geometry (web) standards needs to be given and discussed, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), CityGML, GeoSPARQL, and the OntoBREP and GEOM ontologies. This discussion needs to consider general contexts, e.g., 2D, 3D, detailed, or tessellated geometries, and specific use cases of the construction industry. Based on these discussions, this paper aims to propose a general recommendation for web-based geometry representations to enhance future applications of building data on the web. Due to the variety of use cases and their requirements, as well as technical constraints based on deviant interpretations of geometry descriptions from different geometry kernels, it became clear, that no approach or standard is generally superior to others. The biggest distinction identified in this paper is posed between the context of visualizing, where simplified, tessellated geometry holds the highest advantage, and (parametric) modeling, which requires semantically detailed geometry representations. Hence, we recommend to interlink non-geometric data with multiple geometry representations, to address all relevant contexts and use cases appropriately. The individual geometry representations should be chosen based on the relevant use cases for an optimal experience when using and exchanging geometry on the web. With this recommendation, the benefits of all discussed approaches can be exploited while avoiding their respective challenges. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Building information modeling; Geometry; Geospatial data; Industry foundation classes; Linked Data; Ontology; Web technologies,Architectural design; Construction industry; Linked data; Ontology; Building Information Model - BIM; Design and construction; Future applications; Geo-spatial data; Geometry representation; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Technical constraints; Web technologies; Geometry,Article

To identify the relationship between intelligent railways, digital engineering and railway BIM, and to provide technical support for the top-level technical route of the intelligent railway scientifically and reasonably, the railway industry necessitates the spatial view of digital engineering and the organizational principle of system control theory. Research conclusions:(1) Constructing digital railway project is the premise and carrier of intelligent railway engineering. (2) This paper points out three insurmountable problems of railway BIM to construct digital railway engineering from the perspective of space ontology and engineering cybernetics, namely, space unity, efficient construction and systematic organization. (3) The status of BIM in the railway industry far exceeds its position in the digital engineering system. Applying BIM blindly in the construction industry to railway engineering, will make the development of railway digital engineering constrained. (4) The three-dimensional digital railway products based on spatial ontology and system cybernetics, follow the technical philosophy of digital earth→digital city→digital engineering. From the perspective of 3D GIS technology and space view, universal adaptive value of the full life cycle is provided in the form of spatial database organization with the development of automatic modeling of railway engineering components, which can create physical conditions and application means for the development of intelligent railway applications. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Railway Engineering Society.

In this context, there has been a need for a proper means of exchanging and managing of different kinds of data (e.g., geospatial data, sensor data, 2D/3D models data, material data, schedules, regulatory, financial data) by different kinds of stakeholders and end users, i.e., planners, architects, engineers, property owners and managers. DSSs are used to support various processes inherent in the various building life cycle phases including planning, design, construction, operation and maintenance, retrofitting and demolishing. Such tools are in some cases based on established technologies such Building Information Models, Big Data analysis and other more advanced approaches, including Internet of Things applications and semantic web technologies. In this framework, semantic web technologies form the basis of a new technological paradigm, known as the knowledge graphs (KG), which is a powerful technique concerning the structured semantic representation of the elements of a building and their relationships, offering significant benefits for data exploitation in creating new knowledge. In this paper, a review of the main ontologies and applications that support the development of DSSs and decision making in the different phases of a building’s life cycle is conducted.

Construction contract administration is a complex, knowledge-intensive process that if properly managed can mitigate the contractor's risk exposure. Challenges in proper knowledge management of contract administration are due to: 1) Large amount of fragmented information that is required to manage a construction contract, 2) Information located in heterogeneous sources (Request For Information (RFIs), site notices, schedules, contracts, etc...), 3) Information is handled by many actors in the organization (planners, schedulers, site supervisors, etc...), and 4) Concentration of knowledge related to construction contract administration within a select few in the organization. Knowledge management can play a vital role in the formalizing, sharing and reuse of knowledge related to the contract administration process.

Data from a project developed on a BIM (Building Information Modeling) platform are integrated with other tabulated open data. These datasets are semantically annotated following the semantic data dictionary approach to RDF conversion. Once the datasets are integrated into a triplestore, queries are performed to explore the linking of this data with the generation of inferences. The results suggest that the application of these technologies promotes the semantic extension of construction elements in BIM, facilitating their integration with other knowledge bases and conceptually organizes the data to better retrieve information. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",,Data integration; Decision making; Linked data; Open Data; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantics; Sustainable development; Assessment tasks; Building Information Modelling; Built environment; Certification requirements; Construction projects; Decision-making process; Knowledge model; Ontology's; Semantic technologies; Sustainability performance; Architectural design,Conference Paper

There has been burgeoning research on the technical aspects of ZCBs. However, the aspect of stakeholder engagement, albeit imperative for zero carbon development, has been largely overlooked in the literature. This paper examines stakeholder knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) with regard to ZCBs in a systems manner, employing a new KAP model that integrates ontology, axiology and epistemology as the theoretical lens. The research was carried out through a questionnaire survey and focus group discussions with multiple stakeholders in the building industry in Hong Kong, which is a typical example of a high-density city. The results indicate the generally ambiguous and inconsistent knowledge, relatively negative attitude, and poor practice of stakeholders towards ZCBs. The statistical analysis findings reveal that differentiation exists between different stakeholder groups as to their knowledge, and this highlights the significant role that explicit ZCB knowledge plays in creating a knowledge-induced attitude that favours changes in practice leading to zero carbon developments. The applicability of the developed KAP model is verified using the case of Hong Kong, enabling the dialectics and complexities of stakeholder KAP towards ZCBs to be further clarified. Practical implications are provided to enhance the knowledge, shape the attitudes, and encourage the practices of building towards zero carbon in future cities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Carbon emission; Energy efficiency; Hong Kong; Stakeholder; Sustainable practice; Zero carbon building,Climate change; Construction industry; Emission control; Surveys; Building industry; High-density cities; Innovative strategies; Low-carbon societies; Multiple stakeholders; Questionnaire surveys; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder groups; Carbon,Article

Geospatial data often must be integrated for meaningful analysis, whereas such integration is challenging due to siloed data organization, semantic heterogeneity and multiple representation of geospatial data. Moreover, the visualization of geospatial data is one of the most prominent ways of utilizing geospatial data, however how to properly visualize the data is sometime difficult, as it pertains to a wide range of visualization (cartographic) knowledge. Semantic Web technologies unveil a promising way to mitigate these issues, as they provide means of data integration on the Web, and knowledge representation capacity to formally represent the visualization knowledge.

However, there still exists semantic gaps between design models and regulatory texts, hindering the exploitation of ARC. Thus, a knowledge-informed framework for improved ARC is proposed based on natural language processing. Within the framework, an ontology is first established to represent domain knowledge, including concepts, synonyms, relationships, constraints, etc. Then, semantic alignment and conflict resolution are introduced to enhance the rule interpretation process based on predefined domain knowledge and unsupervised learning techniques. Finally, an algorithm is developed to identify the proper SPARQL function for each rule, and then to generate SPARQL-based queries for model checking purposes, thereby making it possible to interpret complex rules where extra implicit data needs to be inferred. Experiments show that the proposed framework and methods successfully filled the semantic gaps between design models and regulatory texts with domain knowledge, which achieves a 90.1% accuracy and substantially outperforms the commonly used keyword matching method. In addition, the proposed rule interpretation method proves to be 5 times faster than the manual interpretation by domain experts.

Current approaches often rely heavily on users' input, leading to cumbersome behavior authoring experiences and biased results, which do not reflect realistic space-people interactions in virtual settings. To address these issues, we generate an ontology graph from commonsense knowledge corpus and use it to automatically infer behavior distributions that determine agents' contextdependent interactions with the built environment. By means of a natural-language interface, users can interactively refine a building's design by adding semantic labels to spaces and populating rooms with equipment following suggestions that the system provides based on commonsense knowledge. Based on the chosen setup, an authoring system automatically populates the environment and allocates agents to specific behaviors while satisfying a behavior distribution inferred from the ontology graph. This approach holds promise to help architects, engineers, and game designers interactively author plausible agent behaviors that reveal the mutual interactions between people and the spaces they inhabit.

83,DeGraff M.,"Language acquisition in creolization and, thus, language change: Some Cartesian-Uniformitarian boundary conditions",2009,10.1111/j.1749-818X.2009.00135.x,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-73649112051&doi=10.1111%2fj.1749-818X.2009.00135.x&partnerID=40&md5=6ebcb7dff229299e58662b97b1336ace,"This essay prescribes some broad 'Cartesian-Uniformitarian' boundary conditions for linguistic hypotheses about Creole formation. These conditions make constructive connections between Creole studies, historical linguistics and language-acquisition research. Here 'Cartesian' has a mentalist sense, as in Chomsky (1966): I consider the formation of so-called 'Creole' languages to be ultimately reducible to the creation, in certain sociohistorical contexts, of certain idiolects (i.e., individual internal, or 'I-', languages) in the minds of the 'first ""Creole"" speakers'. To avoid circularity, my use of the term 'Creole' in the phrase 'first ""Creole"" speakers' combines some of its original ethno-historical senses: I use the word 'Creole', in this particular context, to refer to the non-indigenous people of African or European descent that were born and raised in the colonial New World, in opposition to those that were born and raised in the Old Worlds of Africa and Europe. The term 'Uniformitarian' evokes Neogrammarian approaches to language change, as advocated, for example, by Osthoff and Brugmann (1878) and Paul (1890). It summarizes my fundamental working assumption that no sui generis or exceptional linguistic processes need to be postulated in order to explain the creation of these languages that have come to be labeled 'Creole': these languages were created by the same psycholinguistic mechanisms that are responsible for the creation of (I-)languages, and for linguistic diachronic patterns, everywhere else. Therefore, 'Creole' languages cannot be distinguished a priori from non-'Creole' languages on any linguistic-theoretical criteria - and 'Creole' languages can be genetically classified by the Comparative Method, on a par with non-'Creole' languages. Such assumptions go against popular claims about Creole genesis such as those in, for example, Thomason and Kaufman (1988), Lefebvre (1998) and Bickerton (1999). In establishing these Cartesian-Uniformitarian guidelines, I correct category mistakes that fail to distinguish explanations that apply to I-languages from explanations that apply to E(xternal)-languages and other social-group phenomena that I-languages are implicated in. One such category mistake concerns the ontology and time course of innovations in specific I-languages vs. their spread across populations of I-languages and into E-language communal norms. Then I investigate the possible - and impossible - contributions of first-language acquisition and second-language acquisition to 'creolization'. In particular, I take my cues from: (i) studies of language- and dialect-contact situations where children and adults seem to play observably distinct roles; and (ii) recent discoveries about instances of Sign Language acquisition and creation where the Primary Linguistic Data seem remarkably restricted. As for elucidating the limits on the restructuring capacities of children and adults, and their respective contributions to language creation and change, it is epistemologically safer to investigate instances of diachronic development that are more recent than the now unobservable early stages of 'creolization'. Throughout this essay, I use the term 'creolization' strictly as an a-theoretical abbreviation for the longer phrase 'development of these languages that, for sociohistorical reasons, have been labeled ""Creole"" '. In the perspective sketched here, creolization is just another instance of language change - or 'language evolution', in Mufwene's (2001, 2008) sense - the investigation of which is to shed light on Universal Grammar. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,,Article

To identify non-value adding activities, lean principles advocate increased controllability and transparency. This may limit the individuals feeling of freedom, creativity and willingness to suggest changes that lead to continuous improvement. Therefore, limiting individual freedom, ""unused creativity"" may increase. The purpose of this paper is to challenge lean construction philosophy with focus on what individuals from the construction industry have identified as freedom. The theory of lean construction principles have been identified and evaluated in a literature review. The analysis of practice is based on 20 open-ended qualitative interviews with production managers from construction-related companies with focus on their perception of freedom and motivation. The study has led to a better understanding of practice and its relation to theoretical assumptions. It distinguishes between what is assumed and what is known. By minimizing waste through focus on principles that do not limit what individuals' perceive as freedom, acceptance of lean construction philosophy can be furthered at construction sites.",Change; Culture; Freedom; Lean construction philosophy; Lean principles; People; Waste,Change; Freedom; Lean construction; Lean principles; People; Agile manufacturing systems; Cell culture; Construction industry; Wastes; Ontology,Conference Paper

In order to engage the office personnel in a Lean Office initiative, the first step was to disseminate the Lean philosophy in a seminar and brainstorm possible actions to be taken at the office. After that, participants visited one of the company's construction sites to see how the concepts, principles and tools presented at the seminar are used at the site. The process of payment was chosen to be the pilot project for the Lean Office initiative because it was deemed to require urgent action due to its importance to the construction site activities as well as because of the time and effort it demanded from the office personnel. The company expects to reduce the time to process bills and make payments, to reduce the incidence of rework, and to discipline site engineers, construction managers, and suppliers about the new processes to sustain the gains throughout time.",Invoice; Lean office; Payment,Construction companies; Construction manager; Construction sites; Invoice; Lean office; Payment; Pilot projects; Site operations; Construction industry; Ontology; Civil engineering,Conference Paper

We highlight the need to recognize that any investigation, particularly one into language, is always a concretely situated and self-grounding activity; our attitude as researchers is one of knowing as engagement with our subject matter. Our task, formulating the missing categories that can bridge embodied cognitive science with language research, requires avoiding premature abstractions and clarifying the multiple circularities at play. Our chosen method is dialectical, which has prompted several interesting observations that we respond to, particularly with respect to what this method means for enactive epistemology and ontology. We also clarify the important question of how best to conceive of the variety of social skills we progressively identify with our method and are at play in human languaging. Are these skills socially constituted or just socially learned? The difference, again, leads to a clarification that acts, skills, actors, and interactions are to be conceived as co-emerging categories. We illustrate some of these points with a discussion of an example of aspects of the model at play in a study of gift giving in China. © 2021 Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos.

In 1999, after nearly 500 years of colonial administration, Portugal returned Macau to the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Macau was designated a Special Administrative Region under the PRC's “one country, two systems” framework. Following the handover, the Macau government liberalized the local casino monopoly and awarded casino gaming concessions to several companies from Macau, Hong Kong, North America, and Australia. Over the past decade, these companies have invested tens of billions of dollars to construct a phantasmagoric post-colonial cityscape comprised of themed integrated casino resorts such as Venetian, Parisian, Galaxy, Wynn Palace, and City of Dreams. As a result, Macau has become the world's most lucrative site of casino gaming, with annual gaming revenues quintuple those of Las Vegas. The city is visited annually by 30 million tourists, more than half of whom are from mainland China. This travel is facilitated by a special exit visa, which the PRC grants to citizens from select, relatively affluent cities and provinces. The PRC promotes such tourism in service of the country's macroeconomic planning, which aims to rapidly urbanize 150 million rural peasants in an effort to create a domestic consumer economy, in order to wean the country off its reliance on an unsustainable production-for-export regime. In this chapter I adopt a materialist ontology to explore the articulation of the new casino resorts with Macau's traditional Portuguese calcada pavement tiles, which the outgoing Portuguese administration installed in a project in the 1990s to pedestrianize Macau's historic city center. Macau's built environment serves a pedagogical function for Chinese tourists by producing cosmopolitan “quality” consumer subjects, and both the calcada tiles and the interiorized and enclosed urban environment created by Macau's resorts produce a Chinese urban imaginary that is a crucial component of this process. © 2019 selection and editorial matter, Christoph Lindner and Miriam Meissner.",,,Book Chapter

This new research method is related to other methods currently used to study contemporary as well as historical urban built environments such as urban morphology, space syntax, and GIS based approaches. BLT mapping uses GIS technology in order to apply an ontology of formal boundary conceptualisations expressing the constitutive differences among the materially constructed subdivisions which shape built environments and are inhabited by urban society. This ontology resulted from a firm socio-spatial theoretical grounding (Vis in Sp Flows: Int J Urb ExtraUrb Stud 2(4): 15–29, 2013a; Vis 2013b; Vis in J Borderland Stud, forthcoming) and is here operationalised on the basis of contemporary, historical, historically reconstructed, and archaeological ground-level city plans of the historic city of Winchester (UK) and Chunchucmil (Classic Maya, Mexico). The research processes of data preparation and the analytical mapping of BLTs by identifying them in empirical data contexts are presented. This alerts the prospective user to the challenges and practical measures involved in using spatial datasets of different origin. The interpretive opportunities of the resultant formal redescription of the urban landscape and the potential of the BLT data structure for both advanced spatial analysis and visualisation is explained. Facilitating this interpretive and analytical mapping practice is expected to stimulate future research to systematically explore society-space relations as manifest and developing in cities over time and in socio-culturally contrasting urban traditions. Devising and conducting this methodology advances the qualitative GIS research agenda for the spatial humanities and social sciences by marrying theoretically informed ideational concepts to quantifiable empirical units of information. © 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,Geographic information systems; Ontology; Studs (structural members); Urban planning; Mapping; Studs (fasteners); Syntactics; Analytical mapping; Built environment; Comparative methods; Different origins; Humanities and social science; Practical measures; research methods; Spatial relations; Boundary lines; Ontology's; Research method; Type mappings; Urban form; Urban morphology; Mapping; Geographic information systems,Conference Paper

Of primary interest to archaeologists is how ontologies are materialized and thus become visible in the archaeological record. However, few archaeologists have evaluated how ontologies can affect monumental practices and their products. This research focuses on how an ontology can be materialized as monumental architecture by presenting a case study of the Belle Glade archaeological culture, located in the Kissimmee-Okeechobee-Everglades (KOE) watershed of southern Florida. I argue that Belle Glade monumental architecture is the materialization of three principles-relatedness, circularity, and place-centeredness-exhibited in Native American ontologies. These principles are embodied in the form of the monuments, which invoke citations to the relatedness between the earth, sky, and water through their emplacement in flowing water, alignments to celestial events, and alignments to other places on the landscape. © 2017 by The University of New Mexico.

These relations create microspaces of wellbeing, keeping forces of urban precarity at bay.

If we apply this conception to Husserl's example of two mutually-touching hands of one body we must then state not that we perceive here a coincidence of certain subjective sensations with certain objective qualities, but rather that my body, in the sense of an object, results from a restructuralisation of the whole field of the body accomplished by the body as the performer of perceptual intentions. The body-object, and for the same reasons also the body-subject, is therefore the product of the analysis of the body in the sense of a field of structuralisation or polarisation, not its original phenomenological ""stratum"", as in Husserl. If the body grasps itself as perceptible only by a change of its own structure, inasmuch as it is a certain field of structuralisation, then an ""external"" thing, which is likewise a pole of such grasping, must belong to the same ontological ""field"" as the body. Merleau-Ponty's ""flesh"", that is the circularity between questioning of perception and answering of the perceived, is thus a phenomenon taking place beyond the boundary of the body as a singular being. Tis fact allows the concept of flesh to be extended and to be understood as an ""element"", that is, as a dimension in which individual beings only appear.",Body (corps); Edmund Husserl; Flesh (chair); Maurice Merleau-Ponty; Ontology; Perception; Phenomenology,,Article

Merleau-Ponty says of his own philosophy that it is founded on the circularity in the body; that is, on the fact that the perceptivity and perception of the body are, from the ontological point of view, one and the same. The inseparability of these two aspects of the body he calls flesh (chair). According to Husserl, I perceive my body such that in a certain perceived object I also understand sensations roused by the perception of that object -1 observe the ""consequential parallel"" between two series of objective and subjective phenomena. Husserl argues that the unity of the body should be expressed as a double unity, and the body as subject-object. In this article I analyse Husserl's example of two hands of the same body touching each other and, in agreement with Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, I attempt to show that the body can appear to itself as an object only on the basis of a differentiation of the body as of a certain field of perceiving. The body as a double unity of subject and object is therefore grounded in the body as a pre-objective and pre-subjective field; that is, in flesh as Merleau-Ponty understands it. This is also the point of departure for an original conception of ontology as we find it in his later philosophy.","Body (Leib, corps); Flesh (chair); Husserl; Merleau-Ponty; Ontology; Perceiving one's own body",,Article

By claiming ontological autonomy from external worlds, the virtual is liberated from the hegemonic control of the physical. To explore the opportunities that such disruption in the physical/virtual continuum offers, I reflect on a series of pedagogical experiments that challenge the “myth of total virtuality”—the idea that the ultimate virtual experience is total immersion. The persistent obsession to fully immerse the user in a supposedly unmediated interiority of the virtual is evident in the minimization of the virtual reality apparatus to a state of almost nothingness. In this paper, I introduce a series of alienation/defamiliarization strategies, through which designers can invoke awareness about the mediation involved in a virtual experience—a condition that I refer to as “metavirtual.” One strategy emphasizes the pixelated ontology of the virtual space by techniques of glitching, low-resolution, low-fidelity, and low-color bitmap renders. Another involves manipulating the phenomenological expectations that our perception often experiences in non-virtual environments. This includes, not only a reconceptualization of the spatial object but also revisiting the agency of the subject in the virtual world. Different modes of spatial experience through portals, flying, and teleportation, affect the subject's perception of space, and thereby alter their measurement of time. © 2022 The Author.

Despite the usual claim of high accuracy by developers/authors, none of the CI-BPMs developed has gained wide acceptance in the construction industry, leading to development of new ones in succession. This study hence reviews the methodological positions in CI-BPM studies using the complete available population. After a critical content analysis of the features of CI-BPM studies, they all appeared to have used the positivism paradigm with realist ontology, objective epistemology and deductive approach. Although the main aim of CIBPM studies to 'predict' failure, an action (i.e. prediction) which is well ingrained in the positivism paradigm, makes the generally adopted positivism paradigm appear very appropriate, the aggressive dynamism of the construction industry and the experts' criticism of the methodology clearly makes it inappropriate. This work proposes pragmatism, in the methodological pluralism form, as the best paradigm for CI-BPM research with realist ontology, combined subjective and objective epistemology, mixed-method research choice, case study, archival and survey strategies, and the deductive research approach.

However, it is still unclear which is the best approach to semantic similarity in this context, since there is no conclusive evaluation of the various measures. Another issue, is whether electronic annotations should or not be used in semantic similarity calculations. Results: We conducted a systematic evaluation of GO-based semantic similarity measures using the relationship with sequence similarity as a means to quantify their performance, and assessed the influence of electronic annotations by testing the measures in the presence and absence of these annotations. We verified that the relationship between semantic and sequence similarity is not linear, but can be well approximated by a rescaled Normal cumulative distribution function. Given that the majority of the semantic similarity measures capture an identical behaviour, but differ in resolution, we used the latter as the main criterion of evaluation. Conclusions: This work has provided a basis for the comparison of several semantic similarity measures, and can aid researchers in choosing the most adequate measure for their work. We have found that the hybrid simGIC was the measure with the best overall performance, followed by Resnik's measure using a best-match average combination approach. We have also found that the average and maximum combination approaches are problematic since both are inherently influenced by the number of terms being combined. We suspect that there may be a direct influence of data circularity in the behaviour of the results including electronic annotations, as a result of functional inference from sequence similarity. © 2008 Pesquita et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Combination approaches; Electronic annotations; Gene ontology terms; Normal cumulative distribution function; Semantic similarity; Semantic similarity measures; Sequence similarity; Systematic evaluation; Semantics; article; computer program; controlled study; data analysis; genetic analysis; genetic similarity; information processing; intermethod comparison; molecular biology; quantitative analysis; sequence homology; system analysis; algorithm; artificial intelligence; automated pattern recognition; biology; classification; gene expression profiling; genetics; linguistics; methodology; normal distribution; protein database; reference value; semantics; sensitivity and specificity; sequence homology; standard; statistics; structure activity relation; ultrastructure; protein; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Expression Profiling; Normal Distribution; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Proteins; Reference Standards; Reference Values; Semantics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sequence Homology; Structure-Activity Relationship; Vocabulary, Controlled",Article

Design/methodology/approach: This research generates contextual and holistic understandings of multiple project-level cases of BIM adoption through an interpretive paradigm guided by relativist ontology and subjectivist epistemology. Two models of project-level BIM adoption (ten-factor theory of BIM adoption and strategic-contingent model of BIM adoption) were merged to formulate the BIM adoption assessment scale (BIM-AAS). A qualitative-oriented case study protocol was developed to extract valid and reliable data from external and internal project data based on BIM-AAS features. The extracted data were analysed using the pattern-matching technique and cross-case analysis. Findings: The results indicate that there was substantial use of BIM tools and technologies in the projects. All the projects adopted collaborative procurement and team and developed integrated building information models. The use of BIM tools, technologies and processes in the projects was found to be above average. The complexities and expectations levels of the projects compliment the nature of BIM adoption in the projects. Research limitations/implications: The BIM-AAS adopted in this research is an excellent example of a project-level BIM adoption analytical tool. It can be assumed in future research. Also, this research contributes to the theory that the level of project complexity and expectations must align with the level of BIM adoption in projects. The study’s findings ratify BIM tools, technologies and processes as the elements of project-level BIM adoption. Practical implications: This research substantiates the actual nature and structure of BIM adoption in Nigeria, thereby simplifying the development of initiatives towards BIM adoption in projects and determining the appropriate strategies for BIM implementation and innovation in the Nigerian construction industry. The most important initiative that the Nigerian government can make to drive BIM implementation is the automating of code checking for building rules and regulations in Nigeria. Originality/value: Previous studies have only reported cases of project-level BIM adoption using surveys and without a standardised project-level BIM adoption model to guide the analysis. This study is the first to formulate and use BIM adoption models for a uniform, critical and contextual analysis of project-level BIM adoption. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Africa; BIM; BIM adoption; BIM Africa; BIM implementation; BIM Nigeria; BIM projects in Africa; BIM projects in Nigeria; Strategic-contingent model of BIM adoption; Ten-factor theory of BIM adoption,Construction industry; Data mining; Digital storage; Housing; Information theory; Pattern matching; Africa; Building information modeling adoption; Building information modeling africa; Building information modeling implementation; Building information modeling nigerium; Building information modeling project in africa; Building information modeling project in nigerium; Building Information Modelling; Model implementation; Model programs; Nigeria; Strategic-contingent model of building information modeling adoption; Ten-factor theory of building information modeling adoption; Architectural design,Article

This new era of smart and sustainable urban systems is enabling transformative change in the way urban communities are interacting among themselves and with the built environment to become more sustainable and resilient to meet the demands of the growing urban population. Interoperability has been shown to be a major barrier for the seamless transfer of information between the heterogeneous landscape of the internet of things (IoT) and smart cities. In order to facilitate interoperability of these systems, this paper conducts a holistic review of principles, methods, and requirements needed to achieve interoperability of smart and sustainable urban systems. Significantly, the use of ontologies, namely the semantic web, has been shown to be the most promising method to enable interoperability. Existing ontologies and frameworks that can enable smart and sustainable urban systems in the scope of the AECO industry are presented.

Design/methodology/approach – The approach combines reviewing literature and some theory within the context of the author's experiences as a participant in the construction industry and associated research and education. Findings – The paper concludes that much has been recycled, often under amended titles. There is notable scope and advisability in paradigm shifts from reductionist/determinist approaches to stochastic approaches which accommodate complexities of interdependencies plus moves from “hard” positivism to “softer” constructivist perspectives. Research limitations/implications – The paper is limited in validity and reliability due to the methods employed. However, the conclusion does stress the essential of researchers being aware of and articulating the limitations of their work; the need for sound theoretical foundations is stressed in regard to both topics and methods. Practical implications – Proper examinations of research, including ontologies, epistemologies, validities and reliabilities, as well as the topics under investigation, promotes good research and its application and avoids recycling of “popular” topics in periodically amended guises. Originality/value – The paper expresses the author's original views, developed over a quite extensive and varied career; however, it expresses views held fairly widely but seldom expressed beyond “closed doors”. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Construction industry; Epistemology; Innovation; Research and development; Research methods,,Article

The triangle suggests the circularity of the widespread view that math arises from the mind, the mind arises out of matter, and that matter can be explained in terms of math. Non-physicists should be wary of any claim that modern physics leads us to any particular resolution of this circularity, since even the sample of three theoretical physicists writing this paper hold three divergent views. Some physicists believe that current physics has already found the basic framework for a complete description of reality, and only has to fill in the details. Others suspect that no single framework, from physics or other sources, will ever capture reality. Yet others guess that reality might be approached arbitrarily closely by some form of future physics, but probably based on completely different frameworks. We will designate these three approaches as the fundamentalist, secular and mystic views of the world, as seen by practicing physicists. We present and contrast each of these views, which arguably form broad categories capturing most if not all interpretations of physics. We argue that this diversity in the physics community is more useful than an ontological monoculture, since it motivates physicists to tackle unsolved problems with a wide variety of approaches. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.",Consciousness; Mathematics; Ontology; Physics,,Article

I view interiority as a condition of the senses rather than an indoor place. Revelations of interiority can be discovered within the urban realm, in public spaces, and in intimate interior conditions. I am especially interested in “public interiority” or these cases of interiority that can be found in exterior urban places. Understanding interiority as a perceived condition grounds the built environment in phenomenology, varied human experiences, and everyday conditions. Herein, I begin with an ontology of interiority, which focuses on various ways of perceiving the nature of things—phenomenology, structuralism, and object-oriented-ontology (OOO). From there, I will analyse a taxonomy of public interiorities, including various strains of form-based, programmatic, atmospheric, and psychological public interiorities. Using real-world examples from my previous research in Bucharest, Romania, New York, and Knoxville, Tennessee as well as well-established examples in art and design, I will then analyse various urban experiences of interiority, and the way built conditions shape experience. In this way, I will bring the interior to the city.1. © 2020, Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.

Furthermore, construction quality information is still recorded on paper, with the risk of document loss and data manipulation, jeopardizing quality accountability. Blockchain has attracted increasing attention from the construction industry because it can record information in an immutable and transparent way and automate some businesses with smart contracts. These properties can tackle information fraud and improve the automation level of OCQI. Unfortunately, very few documented blockchain solutions for OCQI exist. To fill the theoretical knowledge gap, the design thinking approach was adopted to present a blockchain-based conceptual framework. The consortium network and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) were selected as the suitable blockchain type and development platform for OCQI. The consensus process in HLF and smart contracts-based compliance checking are illustrated. Moreover, the benefits of integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and ontology technology with blockchain are analyzed in detail, which can facilitate the coevaluation of these three technologies. Finally, a prototype system was developed to vividly show the theoretical feasibility. The proposed blockchain solution can be fine-tuned and evaluated in future research.

The collaboration requires the iterative and coordinated exchange of information for significant improvement of the building design, construction and management. The successful representation of these information refinements enables the identification of the required level of detail (LOD) for data sharing parameters between the multiple disciplines. Since the last decade, LOD is a promising approach for efficient representation of semantically rich BIM data in different levels. Despite the improvement, there is a lack of efficient implementation in building lifecycle functionalities, because of their fundamental heterogeneity, versatility and adaptability. The proposed approach enables the representation of LOD-sensitive BIM data through the formal definition of ontologies.

They usually take off the quantities of material and related work items and assign appropriate unit costs. In this case, unit cost assignment is solely at the engineer’s professional discretion. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is widely adopted in the building construction industry. Tools can be used to automate material quantity, minimizing the time necessary for engineers to engage in the quantity measuring process. This function, however, does not provide any information on work items that are related to materials in the Bill of Quantity (BOQ). Thus, engineers still need to verify associated work items and assign unit costs. This research proposes an ontological inference of work item that enables an automated search of the most appropriate work items and their associated unit costs. This ontology contains semantic information for work items and work conditions, as well as a semantic reasoning rule that activates the ontology. A case study confirms that the proposed ontology and semantic reasoning rule can work in real-world situations. This paper contributes by eliminating subjective decision-making via search of appropriate work items for cost estimation and the use of BIM data extracted from IFCXML. The proposed ontological approach to building cost estimation will assist engineers in more readily using BIM data from IFCXML and will be helpful in automation of the whole estimation process. © 2015, Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",BIM; cost estimation; ontology; work condition; work item,Budget control; Construction; Construction industry; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Decision making; Engineers; Ontology; Semantics; Building construction industry; Building Information Model - BIM; Cost estimations; Ontological approach; Real world situations; Semantic information; Work condition; Work items; Architectural design,Article

The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) paves the way to address this challenge but the heterogeneity of the represented knowledge about these artifact systems poses a real problem. Ontologies can be considered as part of the solution to overcome the IoT's inherent hurdles. A wise option promoted by recent approaches is to design networks of complementary ontologies. However, different points of view are possible and such diversity could lead to interoperability problems. This article advocates for a networked ontology infrastructure conceived on a principled basis guided by documented judicious conceptualizations. In this regard, this survey points towards ontologies involved in conceptualizations of observations and actuations, where the utility of that conceptualization arises when some features of interest need to be observed or acted upon. For each of the reviewed ontologies, their fundamentals are described, their potential advantages and shortcomings are highlighted, and the use cases where these ontologies have been used are indicated. Additionally, use case examples are annotated with different ontologies in order to illustrate their capabilities and showcase the differences between reviewed ontologies. Finally, this article tries to answer two research questions: Is there a firm basis, broadly admitted by the community, for the development of such a networked ontology infrastructure for the observations and actuations in buildings? What ontologies may be considered helpful towards that goal?. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",actuations; actuator; BIM; Observations; ontology; sensor,,Review

Today, virtual models of a complete building project are often created before the project is carried out in practice. The immediate advantages of this new working process are great; it reduces the number of errors, it gives a better production basis, and it improves clarity and enhances communication compared to traditional 2D drafting methods. However, there is still much unutilized potential in the virtual models, especially for use in the construction and operation phases. A digital link between the virtual models and the physical components in the construction process can improve the information handling and sharing in construction and building operation management. Such a link can be created by means of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology. Ontologies play an important role as the foundation for information sharing between trading partners, reuse of data from one phase in construction to the next, integration of process and product models with enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, easy access of information, communication of data through networks, reading of data stored in electronic tags, etc. This article reviews existing ontologies relevant in relation to creating such a digital link between virtual models and the physical components. The ontologies are reviewed from an ontology consumer (system developer) point of view. The ontologies are categorized according to their applicability to specification of technical services, resources, organizational relations, business processes, and overall frameworks for ontology descriptions and their relations. It is concluded, with a few modifications for industrial use, the technical service and resource ontologies are applicable and that the meta-, organizational, and business process ontologies need further development and industrial maturity to be applicable for use in system development. © 2009 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering.",,Building operations; Building projects; Business Process; Business process ontology; Construction process; Digital links; Electronic tags; Enterprise resource planning systems; Further development; In-buildings; Industrial use; Information handling; Information sharing; Operation phasis; Physical components; Product models; Radio frequency identification technology; System developers; System development; Technical service; Trading partners; Virtual models; Working process; Construction industry; Enterprise resource planning; Industrial applications; Information dissemination; Models; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Resource allocation; Ontology; building construction; civil engineering; computer aided design; data processing; identification method; two-dimensional modeling; virtual reality,Review

Their application varies from any approach structured on ontological commitment to meta-level ontologies serving for variety of purposes. This variety continues also in methodologies for constructing the ontologies. There are wide range of ontologies differing in size and complexity that are created with different design criteria. The main point with the ontologies is their structure and ability to serve for the intended purpose. This is only granted with the continuous evaluation of ontologies in the construction process, and also before release or reuse of the ontology. Ontology evaluation methods cluster around two concepts such as verification methods that ensure the structure of the ontology, and validation methods that examine their applicability in real world. In light of these, different approaches as quantitative and qualitative methods are depicted in literature from subjective evaluations by experts to tools, all of which investigate different characteristics of ontologies. Objectives of this study are to underline the importance of ontology evaluation and to present an employed validation method used during ontology development for delay analysis. In this context, first; literature review on ontology evaluation is presented. Second, a delay analysis ontology is introduced with its basics to lay the foundations of the study. Cases taken from the Turkish construction industry are exemplified to explain the utilized ontology validation process. Comparison of the concepts in the constructed ontology with the expert reports written for each case is used to evaluate the ontology. Furthermore, alternative validation techniques are discussed as well as possible attempts to keep it responsive and up-to-date. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The difference between the expected and actual project outcomes is usually attributed to risk events and how they are managed throughout the project. Although there are several reference frameworks that explain how risks can be managed in construction projects, a major bottleneck is the lack of a common vocabulary for risk-related concepts. Poor definition of risk and patterns of risk propagation in a project decrease the reliability of risk models that are constructed to simulate project outcomes under different risk occurrence scenarios. This study aims to extend previous studies in risk management by presenting an ontology for relating risk-related concepts to cost overrun. The major idea is that cost overrun depends on causal relations between various risk sources (namely, risk paths) and sources of vulnerability that interfere with these paths. Ontology is used to develop a database system that represents risk event histories of international construction projects and to construct a model for estimation of cost overrun. It will form the basis of a multiagent system that can be used to simulate the negotiation process among project participants about sharing of costs considering the risk allocation clauses in the contract, sources of vulnerability, and causal relations between risk events and their impacts. The ontology is constructed by interaction with Turkish contractors working in international markets and extensive literature review on risk-related concepts. The validation test results provide evidence that the ontology is fairly effective to help Turkish contractors to assess cost overrun by considering sources of vulnerability and risk in international construction projects. © 2011 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Construction management; Databases; International construction; International factors; Ontology; Risk management; Turkey; Vulnerability,Construction management; International construction; International factors; Turkey; Vulnerability; Construction industry; Contractors; Costs; Database systems; International trade; Multi agent systems; Occupational risks; Ontology; Project management; Risk management; Risk perception; Risk assessment,Article

Currently, safety risk information related to decision making in metro construction is ill-structurally stored in various disordered formats, which hinders knowledge sharing and reuse. This study develops a domain ontology (SRI-Onto) to formalize safety risk knowledge in metro construction to support safety risk identification. An ontology development method with five steps is adopted. The SRI-Onto organizes safety risk knowledge into seven unified classes (i.e. project, construction activity, risk factor, risk, risk grade, risk consequence, and risk prevention measure). Defined classes, together with corresponding properties and relations, are coded using the Protégé platform. Finally, the SRI-Onto is evaluated theoretically and practically, using criteria-based and application-based evaluations respectively. Results indicate that the SRI-Onto possesses the necessary and essential criteria to serve the purpose of knowledge sharing and reuse. Further, the SRI-Onto is predicted to be generally applicable to safety risk identification of metro construction. © 2019",Domain ontology; Knowledge sharing and reuse; Metro construction; Safety risk identification,Construction industry; Decision making; Knowledge management; Ontology; Safety factor; Subways; Construction activities; Domain ontologies; Knowledge intensive process; Knowledge-sharing; Metro construction; Ontology development; Risk consequences; Safety risks; Risk assessment,Article

The advantages, disadvantages, and future directions of ontology in road asset management, which relies heavily on acquiring and using data, are attracting much research attention over the past few years. This paper aims to provide a thorough and systematic review of ontology, including its development and implementation, in road asset management. In total, 45 journal papers and 12 conference papers published over the last 14 years were reviewed, sorted, and analysed. It is observed that: (1) most ontologies in road asset management target at traffic service and road assets; (2) most ontologies are designed to support the operation and maintenance stage; and (3) RDF-based language and OWL semantics are the two most popular ontology technique. From the review, it is found that the current development and implementation of ontology in road asset management also have a few limitations, including the lack of specific ontology engineering approach, the lack of an automatic mechanism to capture instances, properties and relationships, limited ontologies techniques in this field, and the lack of sharing and linking ontologies of different domains.

In recent years, state highway agencies (SHAs) have been facing the challenge of a shortage of experienced inspectors due to retirements, workforce downsizing, and resignations to take jobs in the private sector. There is a critical need to retain and manage the accumulated construction inspection knowledge (what, when, and how to inspect) and integrate this knowledge into the construction business process. This paper presents an ontological approach to managing inspection knowledge and the development of a risk-based digital inspection system integrated with the construction process. The developed system consists of five knowledge compartments: inspection activities prioritized based on risk; activity-centered pay items; inspection check items; detailed checks that include priority, frequency, object, attribute, and acceptance criteria; and training materials (optional). This risk-based system is designed to align with the construction process by connecting an activity to a pay item and that pay item to a check item, resulting in an automatically generated comprehensive inspection checklist for the activity. The optional training materials are designed to train inspectors in real time on an as-needed basis. Since risk is embedded in every knowledge compartment, this system not only automates and retains the inspection knowledge but also enables SHAs to allocate their limited resources to the most critical items. This system is currently being implemented by the Indiana Department of Transportation as a digital inspection protocol integrated in its e-construction process. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.",,Construction; Construction industry; Employment; Highway engineering; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Ontology; Automatically generated; Construction business; Construction inspection; Indiana department of transportations; Infrastructure construction; Inspection activities; Ontology-based knowledge managements; State highway agencies; Inspection,Article

Therefore, an ontology-based representation model is proposed in this paper that can be applied to organize experts and practitioners' CE analysis knowledge as an ontology to benefit the reutilization of the knowledge.

The enmeshment of the Web and various business processes has made it imperative to define business information in a format that facilitates machine-to-machine exchange and automated processing. The construction industry is not an exception; construction business processes depend on a diverse set of information sources. For efficient processing of the construction business information, it is necessary to publish the information in a format that allows computer applications to easily discover, query and share the information. Currently, the standard for representing, accessing, and sharing a building model is the Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) data model. Several researchers have investigated the limitations of IFCs data model for interoperability among heterogeneous software applications. This paper presents the results of an on-going research on an ontology-based approach to building information modeling to facilitate information exchange among different knowledge domain applications. The approach developed in this study is based on a shared building ontology that models building domain element types and element relationships. The information systems to be integrated should be modeled using the shared ontology; each knowledge domain adds its own element properties to the shared building ontology. SWRL rules are used for mapping element properties from one domain to another.

Knowledge is used as an important resource in many industrial areas, and so it follows that there is a growing interest in knowledge management within the construction industry. Yet because of the unique characteristics of construction knowledge created during projects, there are limitations to its capture and reuse. The knowledge produced during construction projects is project-oriented, experiential, and context specific; due to these characteristics, the reuse of knowledge is difficult. In this research, research team focus on capturing and identifying the characteristics of construction knowledge, then propose a method for applying these characteristics to the development of an ontology-based construction knowledge retrieval system. Moreover, research team developed a system prototype that applies ontology in suggesting related search words during the search process and validated the effectiveness of the prototype in terms of precision and recall rate. By applying the prototype, the precision and recall rate was improved by approximately 10∼30%. © 2013 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",construction knowledge; information technology; knowledge retrieval; ontology,Competitive power; Construction knowledge; Construction projects; Industrial area; Knowledge retrieval; Precision and recall; Research teams; System prototype; Construction industry; Information retrieval; Information technology; Knowledge management; Research; Ontology,Article

Many architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) organisations have invested heavily in information technology and KM systems that help in this regard. While these have been largely successful in supporting intra-organisational business processes, interoperability problems still persist at the project organisation level due to the heterogeneity of the systems used by the different organisations involved. Ontologies are seen as an important means of addressing these problems. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of ontologies in the construction project delivery process, particularly with respect to information and KM. A detailed technical review of the fundamental concepts and related work has been undertaken, with examples and case studies of ontology-based information and KM presented to illustrate the key concepts. The specific issues and technical difficulties in the design and construction context are highlighted, and the approaches adopted in two ontology-based applications for the AEC sector are presented. The paper concludes that there is considerable merit in ontology-based approaches to information and KM, but that significant technical challenges remain. Middleware applications, such as semantic web-based information management system, are contributing in this regard but more needs to be done particularly on integrating or merging ontologies. The value of the paper lies in the detailed exploration of ontology-based information and KM within a design and construction context, and the use of appropriate examples and applications to illustrate the key issues. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Construction industry; Data structures; Generation and dissemination of information; Knowledge management; Semantics,,Article

Safety checking which identifies hazards before they occur is a core process of safety management on construction sites. However, the traditional construction safety checking which is operated by the experienced manager is manual and time-consuming. In order to integrate new technology into the construction safety checking system, a meta model for construction safety checking i.e. CSCOntology (Construction Safety Checking Ontology) has been developed in this paper. This model is formalized using an ontology language, OWL for encoding knowledge over the Web. Safety checking constraints which can extract from construction safety regulation provisions are represented with a rule language, SWRL. Then the construction safety checking processes are implemented in the JESS, a rule engine for the Java platform by transforming OWL knowledge into JESS facts, and SWRL constraints into JESS rules.

However, different use scenarios may only require access to certain specific information stored in the model. In contrast with the ample research of ontology applications in construction knowledge management, research of ontology in construction modeling has been limited. Hence, the purpose of this study is to use ontology in the extraction of a partial building information model from the original complete model. The building information models covered in this study are in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format, which is a widely supported open BIM standard.

For each specific IFC model, an ontology ABox is generated at run time, combining the ontology TBox and the IFC instances in the model. The ABox works as an index in the partial model extraction algorithm.

This information is generally embedded into the BIM model as properties for parametric building objects, and is exchangeable among project stakeholders and BIM design programs - a key feature of BIM for enhancing communication and work efficiency. However, BIM itself is a purpose-built, product-centric information database and lacks domain semantics such that extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information for the purpose of construction workface planning still remains a challenge. Moreover, some information crucial to construction practitioners, such as the topological relationships among building objects, remains implicit in the BIM design model. This restricts information extraction from the BIM model for downstream analyses in construction. To address identified limitations, this study proposes an ontology-based semantic approach to extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information from a BIM design model. This approach allows users to semantically query the BIM design model using a domain vocabulary, capitalizing on building product ontology formalized from construction perspectives. As such, quantity take-off information relevant to construction practitioners can be readily extracted and visualized in 3D in order to serve application needs in the construction field. A prototype application is implemented in Autodesk Revit to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new approach in the domain of light-frame building construction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

To address this need, this paper proposes an ontology-based semantic model for representing and reasoning about the knowledge of DRCPs in construction job sites. The model is designed to serve as a foundation for a knowledge-based decision-making system on DRCPs.

132,Marcus L.,Overcoming the subject-object dichotomy in urban modeling: Axial maps as geometric representations of affordances in the built environment,2018,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00449,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045915908&doi=10.3389%2ffpsyg.2018.00449&partnerID=40&md5=0cc0f8d4649c3d8f91de4ea6fe493d4f,"The world is witnessing unprecedented urbanization, bringing extreme challenges to contemporary practices in urban planning and design. This calls for improved urban models that can generate new knowledge and enhance practical skill. Importantly, any urban model embodies a conception of the relation between humans and the physical environment. In urban modeling this is typically conceived of as a relation between human subjects and an environmental object, thereby reproducing a humans-environment dichotomy. Alternative modeling traditions, such as space syntax that originates in architecture rather than geography, have tried to overcome this dichotomy. Central in this effort is the development of new representations of urban space, such as in the case of space syntax, the axial map. This form of representation aims to integrate both human behavior and the physical environment into one and the same description. Interestingly, models based on these representations have proved to better capture pedestrian movement than regular models. Pedestrian movement, as well as other kinds of human flows in urban space, is essential for urban modeling, since increasingly flows of this kind are understood as the driver in urban processes. Critical for a full understanding of space syntax modeling is the ontology of its' representations, such as the axial map. Space syntax theory here often refers to James Gibson's ""Theory of affordances,"" where the concept of affordances, in a manner similar to axial maps, aims to bridge the subject-object dichotomy by neither constituting physical properties of the environment or human behavior, but rather what emerges in the meeting between the two. In extension of this, the axial map can be interpreted as a representation of how the physical form of the environment affords human accessibility and visibility in urban space. This paper presents a close examination of the form of representations developed in space syntax methodology, in particular in the light of Gibson's ""theory of affordances."" The overarching aim is to contribute to a theoretical framework for urban models based on affordances, which may support the overcoming of the subject-object dichotomy in such models, here deemed essential for a greater social-ecological sustainability of cities. © 2018 Marcus.",Affordances; Space syntax; Spatial cognition; Sustainable urban design; Urban modeling,,Article

The multistakeholder context of the construction industry creates problems such as poor information interoperability and low productivity arising from difficulties in information reuse. Many researchers have explored the use of ontology to address these issues. This study aims to review ontology research to explore its trends, gaps, and opportunities in the construction industry. A systematic process employing three-phase search method, objective analysis and subjective analysis, helps to provide enough potential articles related to construction ontology research, and to reduce arbitrariness and subjectivity involved in research topic analysis. As a result, three main research topics aligned with the ontology development lifecycle were derived as follows: information integration based on ontology, ontology building, and ontology application. In addition, research gaps and the corresponding research agenda were identified. This detailed review provides the basis for further studies on the use of ontology in the construction industry. The research trends and gaps can serve as motivation for researchers and practitioners to work on the next generation of ontology studies to support the development of the construction industry. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Cluster analysis; Construction industry; Information interoperability; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Semantic web; Word cloud,Cluster analysis; Construction industry; Interoperability; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Semantic Web; Information integration; Information interoperability; Information re use; Ontology applications; Ontology development; Subjective analysis; Systematic process; Word clouds; Information use,Article

This perspective is rooted in the notion that there is a fundamental dichotomy between people and nature. As Ingold (2000) points out, this is usually not concordant with the ontology of the Native societies of the Americas. In contrast, such ontologies view humans and their actions as part of the world, rather than as distinct or separate. How do we understand the creation of the built environment in a manner that does not categorically rely upon viewing such features as separate from the “natural” world? We advocate an approach that considers a multi-scalar consideration of both time and acts of creation (see Bailey 2007). In addition, we also suggest, following Ingold (2000, 2012), that such analyses situate these acts within the context of individuals dwelling in a broader landscape. Here, we define landscape as the various actions that are “collapsed into an array of features that must be understood as possessing different temporalities” that are “rooted in the movements of social life” (Ingold 1993: 162; Pluckhahn et al. 2015B: 20). By taking such a view, we rely on notions of structure, agency, and history (sensu Pauketat 2001a, 2001b) and a recursive view of the world, which includes anthropogenic constructions as a part of the world and not distinct from it (see Thompson 2014 for a discussion of these points). © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Suzanne E.

The underlying architectural principles are very complex containing intrinsic 'parametric rules' based on both a philosophical and a building tradition. The parameters are in relation to the religious belief system as well as being derived from the bodily dimensions of the 'head' of a building. We aim at determining in which way these underlying building principles can be preserved by contemporary digital means. As a hypothesis we test a parametric formalization as CGA shape grammar made operative using the CityEngine. In order to formalize these building principles the following methods were devised: identification and collection of appropriate literature in English and Indonesian, partial translation of available material to English, field trips for contextual information and additional knowledge, and transformation of all sources of information into a shape grammar. An interactive visualization of ancient Balinese building principles is exemplified through the traditional house compound, the 'rumah', demonstrating the strength of a parametric approach. Moreover, it includes both, tangible and intangible heritage aspects by analyzing the appearance of (tangible) built heritage, as well as the (intangible) underlying philosophy and traditional knowledge.

It builds on Merleau-Ponty’s contention that mind, the human body and the environment are intertwined in a singular composite, and on Walter Benjamin’s suggestion that mind and city-form, in mutual interaction, through history, have set the course of civilization. Bringing together the fields of philosophy, urbanism, geography, history, and architecture, the book shows the association of existentialism with prevalence of mood disorder in Northern Europe at the close of Little Ice Age. It explains the implications of city-form and traces the role of the myths and allegories of urban design as well as the history of gender projection onto city-form. It shows how urbanization in Northern Europe provided easier access to shelter, yet resulted in sunlight deprivation, and yielded increasing incidence of depression and other mental disorder among the European middle-class. The book uses the examples of Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Dostoevsky and Kafka, to show how walking through the streets, squares and other urban voids became the informal remedy to mood disorder, a prominent trait among founders of modern Existentialism. It concludes by describing how the connection of anguish and violence is relevant to winter depression in cities, in North America in particular. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",,Regional planning; Built environment; Little Ice Age; Mental disorders; Middle class; Mood disorders; Mutual interaction; Walking through; Winter cities; Ontology,Book

The improvement of accessibility is conceived as a long-term objective, to be implemented in stages, according to an incremental development project model. Still today, when work is carried out to eliminate architectural barriers, designers adopt an approach that looks at the 'barrier/disability' binomial, identifying 'dedicated' solutions and tackling the problem of accessibility in relation to specific targets of users whose ability to access and use spaces and environments is assessed in relation to the capability of a person generically defined as 'normally able'. In contrast, in a barrier-free approach, designers are called upon to adopt a broader perspective, to look at the variety of people who make up a real community (extended user base), and to consider different physical conditions, ages, abilities and capacities (motor, sensory and cognitive), from the early stages of the project. In order to promote change and to impart this change of approach, the Autonomous Region of Friuli Venezia Giulia has envisaged integrated actions, aimed, as a whole, at accompanying the process that guides the project culture towards a progressive adherence to the methodological criteria of Universal Design, introducing, at the same time, support measures aimed at financing the Municipalities of the Region both for the preparation of barrier elimination plans (PEBAs) and the implementation of the interventions identified in those plans. Among the envisaged actions, the most important is a general accessibility mapping, which includes the adoption of a terminology system (accessibility ontology) integrated in a specific computer application, through which the municipalities will be able to detect architectural barriers, in a homogeneous way, over the entire regional territory. © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.",Accessibility; Governance; Inclusive design tools,Accessibility; Built environment; Condition; Design tool; Governance; Inclusive design; Inclusive design tool; Incremental development; Integrated approach; Urban accessibilities; Design; construction work and architectural phenomena; disabled person; human; policy; Architectural Accessibility; Disabled Persons; Humans; Policy,Conference Paper

Valproic acid (VPA) can protect against ischemic damage and promote recovery. In this study, we first determined whether a single dose of VPA after stroke could decrease infarction area or improve functional recovery. Next, we investigated the number and morphological characteristic of peri-infarct microglia at different time points and elucidated the mechanism of microglial response by VPA treatment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAo) for 90 min, followed by reperfusion. Some received a single injection of VPA (200 mg/kg) 90 min after the induction of ischemia, while vehicle-treated animals underwent the same procedure with physiological saline. Infarction volume was calculated at 48 h after reperfusion, and neurological symptoms were evaluated. VPA didn’t significantly reduce infarct volume but did ameliorate neurological deficit at least partially compared with vehicle. Meanwhile, VPA reduced dMCAo-induced elevation of IL-6 at 24 h post-stroke and significantly decreased the number of CD11b-positive microglia within peri-infarct cortex at 7 days. Morphological analysis revealed that VPA therapy leads to higher fractal dimensions, smaller soma size and lower circularity index of CD11b-positive cells within peri-infarct cortex at both 2 and 7 days, suggesting that VPA has core effects on microglial morphology. The modulation of microglia morphology caused by VPA might involve HDAC inhibition-mediated suppression of galectin-3 production. Furthermore, qPCR analysis of CD11b-positive cells at 3 days post-stroke suggested that VPA could partially enhance M2 subset polarization of microglia in peri-infarct cortex. Analysis of VPA-induced changes to gene expressions at 3 days post-stroke implies that these alternations of the biomarkers and microglial responses are implicated in the upregulation of wound healing, collagen trimmer, and extracellular matrix genes within peri-infarct cortex. Our results are the first to show that a low dose of VPA promotes short-term functional recovery but does not alter infarct volume. The decreases in the expression of both IL-6 and galectin-3 might influence the morphological characteristics and transcriptional profiles of microglia and extracellular matrix remodeling, which could contribute to the improved recovery. © Copyright © 2021 Kuo, Wang, Wu, Chen and Tseng.",distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO); galectin-3 (Gal-3); ischemic stroke; microglia activation; valproic acid (VPA),4 diphenylacetoxy 1 methylpiperidine; activin A; adiponectin; advanced glycation end product receptor; arginine; B7 antigen; beta actin; biological marker; C type lectin domain containing 10A; cadherin; CD11b antigen; CD163 antigen; CD48 antigen; CD86 antigen; chloral hydrate; ciliary neurotrophic factor; CINC2 protein; collagen; collagen 6a2; cutaneous T cell attracting chemokine; cytokine; cytokine induced neutrophil chemoattractant; deoxyuridine triphosphate pyrophosphatase; ephrin receptor A5; erythropoietin; fibroblast growth factor; fractalkine; galectin 3; gamma interferon; gelatinase B; glycoprotein gp 130; heat shock protein 70; hepatitis A virus cellular receptor 1; histone deacetylase; histone H3; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 1 receptor associated kinase 1; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 2 receptor; interleukin 3; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; junctional adhesion molecule A; lidocaine; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; nerve growth factor receptor; neuropilin 1; Notch2 receptor; pentobarbital; prolactin; prolactin receptor; RANTES; scatter factor receptor; thrombomodulin; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; valproic acid; vasculotropin; vasculotropin receptor; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; autoradiography; bioinformatics; blood brain barrier; body temperature; brain cortex; brain infarction size; brain slice; calcium current; cell density; centrifugation; cerebrovascular accident; chemiluminescence immunoassay; circularity index; common carotid artery; controlled study; craniotomy; cytokine production; differentially expressed gene; dorsal striatum; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; excitotoxicity; experimental behavioral test; extracellular matrix; fractal analysis; fractal dimension; functional status; gene expression; gene ontology; genotype phenotype correlation; heart muscle reperfusion; hemisphere; high throughput sequencing; immunofluorescence assay; immunoreactivity; infarct volume; ischemic stroke; locomotion; low drug dose; male; maximum intensity projection; microarray analysis; microglia; microglial cell culture; microscopy; middle cerebral artery occlusion; modified Bedersons score; morphological adaptation; motor activity; neurologic disease; neuroprotection; nonhuman; particle size; periinfarct microglia; polarization; protein degradation; protein expression; protein microarray; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; receptor upregulation; reperfusion; RNA extraction; sequence analysis; single drug dose; stereometry; TGF beta signaling; transcription initiation; ultraviolet visible spectrophotometry; Western blotting; wound healing,Article

Poststructuralists criticize the systematicity and perceived rigidity of structuralism; in the hands of some there is also an explicit rejection of its ""depth ontology."" Charges of relativism, subjectivism, and indeterminacy were leveled against poststructuralism. But there were, and there continue to be, a set of theoretic and analytic signposts. Among those signposts there is, first, a critical stance toward meaning and interpretation, a position summarized by the term ""crisis of representation"". Second, poststructuralism issued a warning to those who would seek refuge from the above in the certainty of the self. Third and finally, there is a poststructuralist theory of power.

This question is challenging both for the inherent difficulties of the discourse to be modelled but also for the lack of available structured data sources that would distinctly represent the architectural perspective proper, as well as for the contentious nature of the definition of architecture itself. We, therefore, take the step of exploring in broad strokes the possible approaches to architecture, tracing the notion of architecture as idea, process or thing from the literature. On the basis of this enquiry, we propose a model of some top-level referents of architecture using FRBRoo, an extension of CIDOC CRM that can be used to model creative processes. We argue that with the addition of only four classes to this model, to capture certain architecturally specific concepts and activities, we are able to provide an adequate high-level first approach to this problem. Further, by connecting this work to the existing extension of CRMba, which models built work as a system of relations of filled and unfilled spaces, there is a sufficient high-level ontological structure to begin to test for its utility to explore the issues of the relation between architecture as idea, process and thing. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Architectural documentation; CIDOC CRM; CRMba; FRBRoo; Ontological modelling,,Article

Yet, hardly any benchmark is available for this industry that (1) gives an overview of the kind of data typically handled in this domain; and (2) that lists the query and reasoning performance results in handling these data. In this article, we therefore present a set of available sample data that explicates the scale of the situation, and we additionally perform a query and reasoning performance benchmark. This results not only in an initial set of quantitative performance results, but also in recommendations in implementing a web-based system relying heavily on large semantic data.

However, this interest remains largely academic and has not sparked much adoption of web technologies in the field. To nourish adoption of Linked Data in practice, access to the data has to be made more easy. SPARQL, the recommended RDF query language, has proven very powerful for retrieving and updating RDF datasets. However, due to its verbosity and complexity, it is often considered a threshold for developers to implement in their tools. In this paper, we compare SPARQL with Linked Data querying languages that extend the GraphQL syntax, in context of querying building datasets: HyperGraphQL and GraphQL-LD. Since it went open source in 2015, GraphQL has been adopted by a large community of developers, partly due to its elegance and conciseness. As a use case, the queries are performed on an RDF-based multi-model that relies on the recent ISO standard ICDD (ISO 21597). ICDD interlinks information on a sub-document identifier level, based on OWL. It is aimed at the industry in that it adds a layer of Linked Data to documentation formats that are still widely used in practice: IFC, spreadsheets, imagery etc. Therefore, it is considered a tuned use case for comparing these different RDF query languages. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

The performance of proposed approaches relies on the existence of such similarity relationship and sufficient data for inferring it.

This paper addresses this challenge by associating the entities through affinity semantic (to what degree they are related in their application context). Through the analysis of a motivating example in building construction industry, this paper formally defines semantic association based on multiple-perspective domain standards. This paper hypothesizes that the establishment and the use of such standards can practically serve as a framework for reaching semantic interoperability between autonomous information systems.

The similarity of building components is a critical design feature that affects method selection, productivity, and ultimately construction cost and schedule performance. However, there is limited understanding of what constitutes similarity in the design of building components and limited computer-based support to identify this feature in a building product model. This paper contributes a feature-based framework for representing and reasoning about component similarity that builds on ontological modeling, model-based reasoning and cluster analysis techniques. It describes the ontology we developed to characterize component similarity in terms of the component attributes, the direction, and the degree of variation. It also describes the generic reasoning process we formalized to identify component similarity in a standard product model based on practitioners' varied preferences. The generic reasoning process evaluates the geometric, topological, and symbolic similarities between components, creates groupings of similar components, and quantifies the degree of similarity. We implemented this reasoning process in a prototype cost estimating application, which creates and maintains cost estimates based on a building product model. Validation studies of the prototype system provide evidence that the framework is general and enables a more accurate and efficient cost estimating process. © 2007.",3D CAD; Cluster analysis; Component similarity; Constructability; Feature recognition; Model-based reasoning; Ontology; Product features; Product modeling,Computer simulation; Construction industry; Cost effectiveness; Ontology; Structural design; 3D CAD; Component similarity; Model-based reasoning; Product features; Product modeling; Case based reasoning,Article

Within a single industrial domain, there exist many taxonomies that are intended for different applications. Industry specific taxonomies often represent the vocabularies that are commonly used by the practitioners. Their jobs are multi-faceted, which include checking for code and regulatory compliance. As such, it will be very desirable if industry practitioners are able to easily locate and browse regulations of interest. In practice, multiple sources of government regulations exist and they are often organized and classified by the needs of the issuing agencies that enforce them rather than the needs of the communities that use them. One way to bridge these two distinct needs is to develop methods and tools that enable practitioners to browse and retrieve government regulations using their own terms and vocabularies, for example, via existing industry taxonomies. The mapping from a single taxonomy to a single regulation is a trivial keyword matching task. We examine a relatedness analysis approach for mapping a single taxonomy to multiple regulations. We then present an approach for mapping multiple taxonomies to a single regulation by measuring the relatedness of concepts. Cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient and market basket analysis are used to measure the semantic relatedness between concepts from two different taxonomies. Preliminary evaluations of the three relatedness analysis measures are performed using examples from the civil engineering and building industry.

This resulted in a recent shift in the philosophy outlining structural performance during large magnitude earthquakes from preventing collapse to providing highly resilient structures that are easier to repair after a major event. The change in performance philosophy requires the development of new and innovative structural systems that are capable of performing as desired. Research and development of such structural systems has been gaining attention in recent years and have shown significant potential. This study extends previously conducted research on suspended structural systems and floor isolation systems by introducing the analytical solution of buildings with suspended floor slabs with replaceable energy dissipation elements are numerically analyzed under dynamic excitations. The proposed systems comprise of a steel frame with floor slabs suspended from the beams using steel cables. There are two models considered in this study, first in which the slabs are suspended using fixed hooks attached to the beams, thereby coupling the motion of the slab to its immediate neighbor bottom and top floor. In the second model, the slabs are suspended from the beams using rollers such that the motion of the slab is only coupled to the floor immediately below it. Controlled energy dissipation in the structure is realized through the use of steel links that are installed between the bottom face of the suspended slab and the floor beam underneath the slab. The orientation and quantity of the steel links as well as the slab to be suspended in a typical frame is determined such that an optimal performance of the system is achieved. Suspending selected floor slabs and tuning the links for energy dissipation can significantly reduce the damage to the main structural frame and nonstructural components of the system, in addition to reduction in floor response. Moreover, post-tensioned cables are installed adjacent to the links to provide self-centering capability to the slab and reduce its residual drift. The optimal performance of the two models is evaluated for various size frames and found to out-perform a conventional frame in case of large structures. The study concludes with a few important design implications regarding the proposed system. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Dynamic excitation; Suspended slabs; Tuned mass damper,Cables; Earthquakes; Energy dissipation; Geophysics; Ontology; Structural analysis; Structural frames; Dissipation elements; Dynamic excitations; Non-structural components; Research and development; Structural performance; Structure performance; Suspended slabs; Tuned mass dampers; Floors; dynamic response; earthquake engineering; model test; multistorey building; performance assessment; research work; seismic design; seismic response; structural analysis; structural response,Article

I first analyze Husserl’s account of the body as a “two-fold unity” and demonstrate the problematic nature of its four implications, namely, the ambiguous ontological status of the body as subject-object, the view of “my body” as “my object,” the preconstitutive character of the unity of the body, and the restriction of the constitution of the body to touch alone. Building on this analysis, I explain how Merleau-Ponty resolves the difficulties raised by Husserl’s account by reversing it. According to Merleau-Ponty, “flesh” is not a two-fold reality comprising subjective and objective aspects, but an ontological dimension from which these aspects can be abstracted through specific cognitive operations. Consequently, all subjective and objective aspects, even beyond the boundaries of one’s body, must be understood as founded in the indivisible unity of flesh. I argue that a thorough phenomenological description of the human body requires abandoning Husserl’s concept of Leib because it contributes to perpetuating subject-object dualism. In contrast, Merleau-Ponty’s notion of flesh reveals the circularity between subject and object and its general ontological significance. © 2021 The University of Memphis",,,Article

To achieve this objective, we present our ongoing work towards a unifying formal (logic-based) domain model that consists of: (1) a semantically rich ontology of construction schedules, work breakdown structures, and safety concepts; (2) rules for undertaking construction activities that avoid unsafe and wasteful situations. This paper displays the case study of a newly built fire station for validation of the developed prototype.

A vast amount of primary resources is spent during the construction of buildings, which uses 50% of raw materials taken from earth. The energy needed to heat, cool, illuminate, connect the fabric of the built environment contributes 36% to global energy use and 39% of energy-related CO2 emissions. At the same time, the building industry is one of the most fragmented, decen-tralized and diverse industries with nearly 3 million workers organized in 800.000 predominantly small enterprises. The vast spectrum of trades and sub-domains along with the diversity of its products ranging from residential buildings to tun-nels and bridges leads to a wide spectrum of information exchanged in temporary processes with fragile value chains. At the same time, the building sector as a whole is trailing in many productivity indices and in its state of digitalization. The potential to save energy and to contribute to the reduction of the car-bon footprint from the sector can be approached from a number of different angles: Improved design and planning for the few new and the many existing buildings; re-use and circular economy for the materials involved and synergetic effects through increased vertical and horizontal integration of processes, and subsystems. All this requires the integration of knowledge domains. 1.2 Semantic DTs in the Built Environment The individual cyberphysical sub-systems that comprise the built environment from individual buildings to vast and highly connected infrastructure networks including traffic, energy, water and waste networks, are designed, operated and maintained in completely separated, heterogeneous information silos with a very low rate of digitalization. Representing, monitoring, simulating and optimizing even of single nodes in these interconnected, multi-layered networks using dig-ital twins has only just begun. Within a single domain of these networks such as an individual building, a road-network or bridge, the current and past sys-tem states, their long-term monitoring and improvement requires comprehensive semantic models digital twin models. Such models are still in their infancy. Cur-rent and evolving information models are still mostly designed to capture static as-planned individual lifecycle stages, have bespoke and disparate insular solu-tions and little to no vertical and horizontal connectivity with other nodes in the network. Information exchange models for different aspects at various levels of granularity from geospatial superstructures (GIS) to building components (BIM) often have hundreds or even thousands of semantic entities and the sheer size of the structured vocabularies to describe products range in the tens of thousands of concepts which often differ on national or even regional levels. 1.3 Use cases and examples In the presentation an overview of ongoing research, development and standard-ization efforts regarding the creation, integration and interoperability of seman-tic Digital Twins for the built environment is provided. Concrete challenges and solution approaches of past and ongoing research from different use cases and application domains of Semantic Digital Twins for-the assessment and energy refurbishing of residential buildings-monitoring and predictive maintenance of bridges-road network interoperability with Linked Data across European borders are used to illustrate these challenges. These include the semantic lifting of legacy data models, the alignment and integration of vast domain vocabularies, multi-modal integration of heterogeneous status information (sensor, images, measure-ments) and ongoing efforts to create reference frameworks for semantically rich Digital Twins in the built environment.

It requires major human efforts and is time-consuming, costly, and human error-prone. To reduce manual efforts in collecting information from construction procedural documents, selecting appropriate sensing techniques to collect data on the jobsite, and giving in-time feedback for progress monitoring and compliance checking, the authors: (1) proposed a semantic rule-based information extraction (IE) method to extract construction execution steps from construction procedural documents automatically; (2) developed a construction procedure and data collection (CPDC) ontology to classify construction site information and provide guidance on selecting sensing techniques for collecting jobsite data based on the extracted information; and (3) proposed a construction procedural data integration (CPDI) framework, which could integrate textual data and sensing data to conduct construction execution steps compliance checking automatically. The proposed IE method offers a novel way to retrieve construction activities (e.g., install door and prepare surface) from the construction procedural documents that are an important source of information but were seldom analyzed in previous research. It focuses on extracting construction execution steps, which supports the incorporation of execution sequence information into construction jobsite management. A novel information classification application based on a newly developed CPDC ontology is provided to support IE. The IE results provide a new instrument for selecting sensing techniques based on different construction site data categories. The proposed method is developed to support a targeted unified CPDI framework that integrates the following: natural language processing (NLP) and sensing techniques to automatically extract, analyze, and process both planned procedures from textual data from construction procedural documents and executed procedures from sensing data of construction jobsites. It also can be extended to any domain applications that contain textual information and site activity information that needs to be matched or compared. In this paper, the authors focus on the NLP-based textual information extraction of the construction procedural documents, introduced the detailed steps involved, and proposed a CPDI framework on top of and as an application of the IE method. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the IE method with a set of open-source specifications. Comparing it to a manually developed gold standard, 97.08% precision and 93.23% recall were achieved using the proposed IE method for the extraction of construction execution steps. A qualitative analysis on sensing technique selection based on the IE results was also performed. The proposed IE method can be applied to the automation of construction site management tasks (e.g., construction monitoring) that integrates both textual information and sensing data to support construction decision-makings. It enables the transformation of construction monitoring/control from a human-intensive process to an automated one. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Compliance control; Construction; Construction industry; Data acquisition; Data integration; Data mining; Decision making; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Activity informations; Construction activities; Construction jobsite; Construction monitoring; Construction procedures; Construction site managements; NAtural language processing; Qualitative analysis; Classification (of information),Article

Although this line of research is fundamental and has brought valuable contributions to this endeavor, it does not represent a solution to the challenge, semantic heterogeneity, since the performance of proposed approaches significantly relies on the degree of uniformity, formalization and sufficiency of data representations but most of today's independently developed information systems seldom have common knowledge modeling frameworks and their data are often not formally and adequately specified. Consequently, a workable solution usually requires interventions of domain experts. In human society, hierarchically structured standards (or taxonomies) for characterizing complex application processes and objects used in the processes are often used as a common and effective way to achieve some semantic agreements among stakeholders within a domain. This research hypothesizes that the establishment and the use of such standards can serve as a framework that can effectively facilitate the reconciliation of semantic heterogeneity in complex application domains. However, the reality shows that a comprehensive priori consensus is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to reach. Consequently, various complementary and competing standards are often created and their constant-changing nature yields another level of challenge in achieving the hypothesis. This paper focuses on the development of methodology for bridging complementary standards within an application domain. It exemplifies such standards in building construction industry where interoperability problems are prevalent and human interactions are commonplace. It proposes a semi-automatic approach for semantically associating the standards to reduce costly human intervention in a workflow. The approach formalizes standards by using ontology and discovers their affinity (to what degree they are related with respect to their usage) from automated project document processing and semi-automatic domain expert inputs.

The structure of the ontology will be described, along with how regulations can be encoded, and subsequently executed.

Since model-based planning is becoming widely accepted in the building industry, we assume that planners are working on partial models stored in distributed and heterogeneous model databases. A main goal of this project is to provide the engineers with an integrated view on these heterogeneous models. To realize this, two levels of integration have to be considered: the access level integration and the semantic level integration. In the presented project, the problem of access level integration is approached by software agents. However, in this context the core problem is the inconsistent semantics of the heterogeneous building model. Thus, this paper focuses on the semantic level integration. Based on an analysis of different types of heterogeneity a method for semantic integration of building model data in civil engineering is presented on the example of fire protection engineering. To provide fire protection engineers with an integrated transparent view, an ontology-based approach has been developed. The problems of distribution and heterogeneity are approached by different solution layers, following the principle of separation of concerns. By those means, the integration effort can be reduced effectively and resources can be integrated flexibly into network-based building project organizations. © 2007 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Building industry; Building projects; Communication and collaborations; Fire protection engineering; Heterogeneous modeling; Heterogeneous models; Semantic integration; Separation of concerns; Civil engineering; Computer aided engineering; Construction industry; Fire protection; Planning; Semantics; Integration,Conference Paper

Much attention has been placed on characterizing of the genome in the past; nevertheless, genetics only account for about 10% of an individual's health conditions, while the remaining appears to be determined by environmental factors and gene-environment interactions. To comprehensively understand the causes of diseases and prevent them, environmental exposures, especially the external exposome, need to be systematically explored. However, the heterogeneity of the external exposome data sources (e.g., same exposure variables using different nomenclature in different data sources, or vice versa, two variables have the same or similar name but measure different exposures in reality) increases the difficulty of analyzing and understanding the associations between environmental exposures and health outcomes. To solve the issue, the development of semantic standards using an ontology-driven approach is inevitable because ontologies can (1) provide a unambiguous and consistent understanding of the variables in heterogeneous data sources, and (2) explicitly express and model the context of the variables and relationships between those variables. We conducted a review of existing ontology for the external exposome and found only four relevant ontologies. Further, the four existing ontologies are limited: they (1) often ignored the spatiotemporal characteristics of external exposome data, and (2) were developed in isolation from other conceptual frameworks (e.g., the socioecological model and the social determinants of health). Moving forward, the combination of multi-domain and multi-scale data (i.e., genome, phenome and exposome at different granularity) and different conceptual frameworks is the basis of health outcomes research in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Environmental exposure; External exposome; Ontology; Semantic standard,conceptual framework; environmental factor; genome; genotype-environment interaction; semantic standardization; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; built environment; cigarette smoking; conceptual framework; demography; dietary intake; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental health; exposome; exposure variable; genome; genotype environment interaction; human; ontology; outcomes research; patient coding; priority journal; Review; semantics; social capital; social determinants of health; social environment; standardization; causality; environmental exposure; female; male; semantics; Causality; Environmental Exposure; Exposome; Female; Humans; Male; Semantics,Review

First, it employs a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and template matching to restrict the range of ways in which textual requirements can be stated. Second, knowledge-based models work hand-in-hand with the NLP and templates to help designers fill in the details of a model that might be missing. Third, we envision the proposed approach being part of a multidomain semantic modeling and reasoning framework that includes the building construction domain and its connections to processes for project management and governance. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach to the practical development and construction of building systems, we developed a prototype software tool-the framework for linking ontology objects and textual requirements (FLOOR)-and procedures for the validation of individual textual requirements and groups of textual requirements related to construction tasks. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Construction specification; Natural language processing (NLP); Ontologies and rules; Semantic model; Template matching; Textual requirements,Architectural design; Construction; Construction industry; Knowledge based systems; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Software prototyping; Template matching; Building construction industry; Construction specifications; Language processing; Multi-domains; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Ontologies and rules; Semantic model approaches; Semantic modelling; Textual requirement; Project management,Article

Most previous work has gone into hardware abstraction, while service abstraction has been neglected. This paper presents an information discovery mechanism for BOSs that is based on an ontology which integrates with other semantic models used in the space. The built environment is characterized by extreme heterogeneity; no buildings are entirely alike. Equipment is replaced or updated, control systems and building functionality evolve, as applications, models, forecasters, and controllers improve. For services deployed in such settings to operate at a scale, they must be robust to change. Describing service interfaces using a semantic model, together with the physical context in a building, enables applications to query for their service dependencies. Applications then depend on an abstract query, instead of specific services. For evaluation, nine services running on models of the service ecosystems of three concrete buildings, are implemented, demonstrated, and discussed. Results show services have successfully been made portable and adapts to the changing environments of buildings. Merging and splitting services without code changes to depending services also work as intended, as well as increasing system resilience, by arbitrating similar services. © 2021 ACM.",Dependency Resolution.; Information Discovery; Ontology; Service Abstraction; Service Discovery,Abstracting; Buildings; Semantics; Building services; Cost-efficient; Dependency resolution.; In-buildings; Information discovery; Ontology's; Portable buildings; Semantic modelling; Service abstraction; Service discovery; Ontology,Conference Paper

Zernike moment as shape feature is to verify the invariance of objects for silhouette image. In addition, a set of geometrical features is to explore the objects shape using two features of rectangularity and circularity. Then the extracted features are normalized and employed for multi-class support vector machine either for learning or retrieving processes. The retrieving process relies on three main tasks which namely Query Engine, Matching Module and Ontology Manger, respectively. Query Engine is to build the input text or image query using SPARQL language. The matching module extracts the shape and geometric features of image’s objects and employ them to Ontology Manger which in turn inserts them in ontology knowledge base. Benchmark mammals have been conducted to empirically conclude the outcome of proposed approach.

From the biological perspective however, industrial systems are generally inefficient. Manufacturing systems from the biological perspective therefore require the incorporation of tools to support decision making, thereby enabling organizations to improve their functions and competitiveness in a global and integrated perspective. Accordingly, at meso level, eco-industrial parks are gaining importance as an approach towards ensuring CE. In this work, an ontological framework for CE, based on industrial metabolism, is developed as the technology for information and knowledge models to share the circularity of resources through industrial ecosystems, based on ecological, economic, and social criteria. The ontology developed is modelled using Ontology Web Language and integrated in an architecture based on bio-inspired Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Moreover, a quantitative method, Ecological Network Analysis, is incorporated into MAS knowledge to analyze and establish relationships and metabolic pathways between companies, which can increase the circularity of technical nutrients and reduce biological nutrient extraction. The integrated model is applied to a case study on the product life cycle for the establishment of its metabolic pathway through an eco-industrial park. The subsequent incorporation of MAS thereby establishes the Smart Eco-Industrial Park. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Circular economy; Ecological network analysis; Industrial metabolism; Multi-Agent system; Ontology; Sustainable manufacturing,Decision making; Ecosystems; Life cycle; Manufacture; Metabolism; Multi agent systems; Nutrients; Ontology; Physiology; Circular economy; Ecological network analysis; Industrial ecosystems; Industrial metabolism; Natural environments; Ontological frameworks; Ontology web language; Sustainable manufacturing; Industrial economics; environmental economics; manufacturing; nature conservation; network analysis; organizational framework; sustainability; Article; eco industrial park; economic aspect; economic model; environmental management; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; life cycle assessment; quantitative analysis; recreational park; resource management; social aspect; technology,Article

This article presents a stakeholder-oriented approach, implemented in a planning support system, to provide stakeholders with specific information from their points-of-view, regarding the impact of energy strategies on their interests in the built environment. The approach is based on semantic web technologies, where an ontology has been developed to provide targeted information for different stakeholders while developing urban energy strategies. Measures to be implemented are defined. Stakeholders are identified and questions they raise for their decision making are listed, as competency questions of the ontology. Computation models to answer these questions are identified or developed, based on the data availability in the city. The semantics used in these models are then captured and classified within the ontology. Then the decision making knowledge of the stakeholders is integrated within the ontology, as inference rules. Finally, the ontology is used through a web-map-based interface.

To reach this goal, it is necessary to use open standards for model exchange such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The non-profit organization buildingSMART defines this standard. IFC provides object types and attributes, which describe properties of objects. The IFC standard do not address possible values for attributes; but beside coordinated names for object types and attributes, coordinated values for attributes are required. This is necessary for the evaluation of digital models for different purposes. Several approaches in the fields of ontology and classification systems address this issue. However, at present time there is no clear distinction between prerequisites that modeled objects have to fulfill and products, which satisfy these requirements. Suppliers or construction companies at the interface between planning and construction propose products for the modelled requirements of the planning process. This paper describes an approach that bases on a dictionary, which provides standardized object types, attributes and values. A project database and a database with products, called supplier database, use this dictionary as a basis. Resulting from the modeling phase, the project database is ultimately mapped with the supplier database to propose products that fulfill the requirements.

Underpinned by the frames of smart learning environments, the paper reiterates experiencing urban ontologies as spatial learning environments. By drawing from a range of transdisciplinary and experiential modes of learning, this paper maps how an undergraduate course on Bangalore city in India served learners to critically engage with and experience spatial urban ontologies both digitally, and in real-world experiences of learning, furthering learner autonomy and reflection. The methodological prisms of this paper are autoethnography and critical reflection. It is organised around enabling learners recognize the experiential, embodied urban spaces through the urban sensorium via real-life engagements with urban spaces, and creation of digital portfolios that map this learning. Findings from the learners’ knowledge of sensory learning, the city’s intersectional aspects, and the student’s embodied and emplaced self in built environments and digital spaces are analysed via cognitive and affective-reflection levels; the course instructor's reflection is analysed via a process-reflection level. These reflections hold implications for the pedagogy of urban studies in undergraduate classrooms by foregrounding spatiality and urban sensorium as significant critical and affective pedagogic tools.

Products and services are developed faster, hold a shorter shelf-life disrupted by new offerings, and exist within global challenges such as climate change and sustainability. We live in the Anthropocene Era with human-induced Climate Change and the sixth mass extinction. Design challenges for product/service creation are shifting from a paradigm of customer-centric focus linear system to a new paradigm that includes a broader planetary context with a circular economy. The Human-Centered Design Thinking process popularized by IDEO/Stanford d.school identifies human-centered design opportunities for products and services through five steps: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test. Unfortunately, a mere customer-centric view of product or service is insufficient for planetary-scale challenges requiring a broader focus that includes all life forms and the planet’s health. Thus, moving forward, design for the 21st century requires broader perspectives; design educators are challenged to overcome the limitations of Human-Centered Design Thinking. The point of this paper is that Human-Centered Design Thinking needs to be used in conjunction with new design methods that take into account the larger planetary context over time. In this paper, I discuss how futures thinking methods can augment design thinking methods to overcome limiting human-centered worldviews, epistemologies, and ontologies. In particular, how Causal Layered Analysis (CLA) can augment designers’ creative responses to behavior change challenges such as rapid-decarbonization through four layers (e.g., litany, systems, worldview, myths/metaphors).

While 3D city models, Internet of Things (IoT), and domain models are essential components of smart cities, the integration of IoT resources and 3D city models is a central information backbone for smart city cyber-infrastructures. However, we argue that most of the existing solutions integrating 3D city models and IoT resources are usually customized according to applications and lack of interoperability. To improve the interoperability between smart city modules, this study proposes a semantic-based methodology to integrate OGC CityGML and SensorThings API standards. Based on the data models from these two standards, this study proposes an integration ontology to connect information from these two standards. Due to the flexible definition of Thing in the IoT, the proposed ontology also considers multiple views of Thing. As a result, information from the CityGML and SensorThings API can be connected and queried via SPARQL queries. In general, this proposed integration ontology can facilitate the integration of IoT and 3D city models to achieve interoperable smart city. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",CityGML; Open standard; Semantic web; SensorThings API,Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Integration; Interoperability; Ontology; Semantic Web; Smart city; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D city models; Built environment; Cyber infrastructures; Digital system; Flexible definition; Internet of Things (IOT); Semantic Web technology; Sparql queries; Internet of things,Conference Paper

A comparison of the Late Formative center of Jatanca (300–100 bce) with the neighboring Moche site of Huaca Colorada (ad 650–850) in the Jequetepeque Valley of Peru will then demonstrate how radical transformations in architectural construction point to fundamental changes in how communities perceived and experienced the material world. The markedly different traditions of place making certainly suggest significant shifts in the meaning and political effects of built environments. Nevertheless, the article concludes with the important caveat that the pronounced architectural differences do not necessarily translate to major shifts in ontologies and constructions of personhood but more likely to transformations in ritual practices and political organization. Therefore, the comparison reveals the dangers of assuming that distinct materialities correspond to distinct ontologies or even distinct “materialisms.” Ultimately, the author argues that a focus on the materialities of place making, as opposed to generic interpretations of ontology, permits a more effective means of reconstructing historical process within the specific Andean context. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Andean; Materiality; Moche; Nonrepresentational theory; Ontology; Place making,,Article

The search is to construct the reality of human habitation. Moreover, the investigation is also to deal with the question of why does humankind builds and dwells on the earth. This study argues that the question is considerably primordial for architectural theory and history; it is expected that being able to respond to the question properly, we can distinguish the presence as a phenomenon from its objectivity.

Collectively the agents combine a range of specialist ontologies scoped to sub domains to realise individual and collective skills. Each ontology uses an appropriate knowledge representation to maximise simplicity while retaining adequate expressivity. A shared upper ontology is employed to support general communication and to provide 'common sense' knowledge. The agents in general are characterised by the strong notion of agency (as described in the literature), using the BDI (belief, desire, intention) model of agency as a powerful abstraction tool that is suited to applications where the complexity of systems and processes cannot be fully modelled using conventional techniques. The goals of the agents are, typically, to maximize some defined utility, and resulting behaviours are individual and collaborative, aligned and opposed. Knowledge retained, evolved and utilised by agents needs only to be generally locally consistent, and collectively the system can contain redundancy.

More precisely, I argue that the theses that he maintained in the Empirism, Semantics, and Onotology and the volume of The Library of Living Philosophers devoted to his philosophy put him close to proponents of epistemicism, according to which ontological debates over truth-values of metaphysical theses need not to be verbal disputes, but the prospects of resolving them are meager, since there are no evidences that could support either given metaphysical thesis or its negation. Most likely, Carnap should be read as a proponent of a more radical version of this view, since he maintained that in principle there are no such evidences. I find this view fit well with Carnap's argumentative strategy against substantial character of metaphysical debates, since he stresses the lack of evidences in favour of or against metaphysical claims as the main reason for his deflationism in ontology. However, what is the most worrisome in taking this route of interpreting late Carnap views on ontology is that among the presuppositions of epistemicism is the thesis that one can make sense of the talk about truth-values of metaphysical claims, whereas Carnap maintained they lack truth-values due to lack of cognitive contents. But taking the change of his view on the nature of semantic values in the volume of The Library of Living Philosophers devoted to his philosophy, where he claimed that extralinguistic entities should serve a role of semantic values and the notion of truth should be defined relatively to a given interpretation in a given model, I find his opinion on metaphysical claims unjustified, since one can define the the notion of truth for these claims relatively to models and hence make a talk about their truth values (relatively to models) sensible. It doesn't follow from that that one can also make a sense of a claim being absolutely true, since it would require to take one model to be special one in the sense that it fits the way reality is, which is something that the proponent of epistemicism deny on the ground that there are no evidences that could be taken to show that one of the models of a given language is special in this respect. I also discuss applications of the inference to the best explanation in argumentation in favour of various sorts of realism and argue that this kind of argumentation always leaves room for some ontological dispute between parties from which one deny the existence of entities that the other argued for through application of the inference to the best explanation and hence that no metaphysical debate can be resolved by application of the inference to the best explanation under the threat of circularity. The paper is the continuation of considerations made in my paper The Later Carnap and Contemporary Metaphysical Debates. Part I, in which I've argued that one can treat Carnap to be also a proponent of fictionalism. In effect, Carnap's deflationism in ontology seems to be a combination of fictionalism and epistemicism.",Carnap; Deflationism; Epistemicism; Fictionalism; Metaontology; Ontology,,Article

However, a closer examination shows that proponents of EM do not present a unified and consistent definition of DC. Moreover, they find it difficult to prove that higher-order properties can be causally significant without violating the causal laws that operate at lower physical levels.

Stated requirements for data interpretation tools allow further processing of the ontology-based knowledge base. Described ontology-based diagnostic systems have shown their applicability in the case of data storage systems in the construction industry. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.",,Construction industry; Data mining; Economics; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Memory architecture; Ontology; Reliability; Comparative analysis; Data interpretation; Data storage systems; Diagnostic systems; Knowledge representation method; Ontological approach; Ontology-based knowledge base; Technical diagnostics; Digital storage,Conference Paper

Postindustrial landscapes are, by definition, functionally and materially obsolete, and in many cases derelict and decaying. While they hold historical significance, these sites are often not widely perceived as valuable contributors to our heritage. Yet these landscapes persist. We argue that the material persistence of these features is the result of generally unrecognized processes of informal material conservation. In this paper, we outline a new framework, vernacular preservation, an ontology for heritage professionals to use in considering how to approach and recognize nonformal interventions that result in the protection of heritage resources. Here, we use the postindustrial landscape of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula-a former copper-mining district- to illustrate how vernacular preservation differs from formal historic preservation, reviewing the process of vernacular preservation and how it is activated in practice. Vernacular preservation constitutes perhaps the most traditional, common, and widespread mechanism of material conservation of the historical built environment yet has been largely invisible, little discussed, and undertheorized by the heritage preservation community. Understanding this preservation process begins by acknowledging its existence and by extending the heritage dialogue to include these underrepresented historical properties and their important role in defining postindustrial landscapes. We conclude the paper with a discussion on how this novel approach to thinking about preservation extends broadly to the field and should be given greater attention. © 2017 University of Pennsylvania Press.

Log exports to the Pacific Rim began in earnest after the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 generated billions of board feet of salvaged timber. This market was maintained and expanded owing to Japan's demand for high-quality logs for its construction industry. Contentious debate surrounding disproportionate gains and losses to forest product market participants in the PNW (timber owners, mill owners, communities, and consumers) led to government intervention and restriction of volumes available for export. The debate ended and the market declined as a result of three factors: reductions in timber harvesting from PNW forests, changes in Asia's demand, and globalization of wood markets. These changes with implications for trade and timber market participants are discussed.).",Forest products trade; Globalization; Japan; Log exports; Pacific Northwest trade; Softwood log trade; Spotted owl,export; forest product; globalization; timber market; North America; oceanic regions; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; United States; Western Hemisphere; World,Review

They also have different requirements for accuracy, verisimilitude, and rendering performance. These various organizations have different standards and business processes for which they have developed their own paper and digital delivery procedures. To solve these problems, The National BIM standard (NBIMS) establishes standard definitions for building information exchanges to support critical business contexts using standard semantics and ontologies. This Standard forms the foundation for accurate and efficient communication and commerce that are needed by the construction industry. This paper investigates the general objectives of this standard, its relationship to structural engineering practice and focuses on the importance of involvement and contribution of structural engineering community to this standard. The standard is still in its infancy and the evolution and maturity of NBIMS will help to establish advanced design, communication and simulation tools that give the structural engineering community an opportunity to change the way it works in the industry, including open collaboration between stakeholders, design for optimum structure, increased energy efficiency, flexibility, constructability, comfort, and sustainability.

I focus on the relation between transcendental and metaphysical deductions in Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason, and on the problem of “epistemic foundationalism” and categoriality in Husserl’s Sixth Logical Investigation. I propose that the strategy of circularity is manifested through the peculiar self-enclosure of the categories of transcendental deduction vis-à-vis metaphysical deduction (Kant) and categorial intuition vis-à-vis sensuous intuition (Husserl). Although it is usually regarded as a deficient and damaging occurrence in argumentation, circularity appears to be a crucial component in the analysis of both thinkers. The analytical realms recognized by both these thinkers, is acknowledged as continually dependent upon the self-evidential “contingency” of the realms they are supposed to hierarchically overarch. The strict separation between the transcendental and phenomenological realms and their addressees appears to be founded on mutual circularity, where the relation between investigator and investigated extends beyond their separation and reconciliation. Both Kant and Husserl, through the circular relationship with empiricism-rationalism and psychologism radically re-articulated the logic-ontology and founding-founded polarities. © VEDRAN GRAHOVAC, 2018.",Categorial intuition; Categoriality; Circularity; Husserl; Kant; Metaphysical deduction; Transcendental deduction,,Article

The main philosophical positions I will discuss are Husserl's phenomenology of the ego in his later transcendental phase, the Heideggerean view of the nature of Dasein, and Sartre's approach of the Being-for-itself as mainly exposed in Being and Nothingness. The central idea defended throughout this article is that self-constituting temporality as immanently induced may serve as a common foundation of the nature of the transcendental ego both in the Husserlian phenomenology and in the Heideggerean and Sartrean alternative positions; further, I will hold that, as consequence, the ultimate question about the possibility of an ontology of the pure ego is transposed to the question of the origin and foundation of inner temporality. Yet, in this case one is set to face anew the circularity of an infinite regression in terms of reflecting-reflected and the inevitability of the subjective character of the origin of temporality. Besides this key question - a primary issue of this article - I will address the issue of the convergences and diff erences regarding aspects of the essential nature of the Husserlian ego, the Heideggerean Dasein, and the Sartrean Being-for-itself, especially regarding the widely debated topic of the 'exteriority' of the latter two 'egological' concepts with regard to the world in contrast to the 'interiority' of the Husserlian absolute ego. © STATHIS LIVADAS, 2019.",Absolute flux of consciousness; Being-for-itself; Being-in-itself; Dasein; Ecstatic; Infinite regression; Temporal unity; Transcendental ego,Absolute flux of consciousness; Being-for-itself; Being-in-itself; Dasein; Ecstatic; Infinite regression; Temporal unity; Transcendental ego; Philosophical aspects,Article

While there has been much discourse around the theoretical underpinnings of construction education, not much has been set in writing. A philosophical position has not always been to the forefront of those pioneering and well-intentioned construction educationalists. There has been, rather, a ‘systems thinking’ approach, a sense of wanting to prepare an educational experience that would equip the future leaders in construction to ensure they would develop the knowledge, skills and competences to take their place in an ever-changing architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. Now, at least around Europe, there is an ever-increasing attempt to identify the paradigms within which construction education sits comfortably, thus attempting to pave the way for the future. This could be called a philosophical positioning. There follows an exploration of the evolution of the education of the construction professional through a review of the literature and other sources in an attempt to make some sense of this journey. The paper also presents the discourse from the educational research perspective where the connection between the role of theory and philosophy has been a matter of discussion for many years. Biesta in his work calls for the intelligent use of theory and philosophy and advocates pragmatic positioning in regard to discourse. This pragmatic framework offers the freedom to gain control over what construction education constitutes as it offers a way of thinking that allows the educationalist freedom to challenge. What is presented and debated is the discussion that has been documented with a view to offering some perspective on its importance. Some philosophical perspective is also offered around the developments with the added suggestion that AEC is firmly seated in the ‘pragmatic’ paradigm. Much progress has been achieved to date but it is now time to offer a possible further step forward. While a pragmatic philosophical position is suggested it is not to imply that this is the only tool that might be used. The freedom to work within the pragmatic paradigm offers diversity that can draw together some of the thoughts that challenge and build the arguments about the role and position of theory in construction education. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Construction education; Philosophy; Pragmatism and research,"Construction; Ontology; Philosophical aspects; Architecture , engineering and construction industries; Construction education; Construction professionals; Educational experiences; Educational research; philosophy; Skills and competences; Systems thinking; Education; construction industry; education; philosophy; research; theoretical study; Europe",Article

This study argues that the presence of a man-made environment has been forgotten or falling into oblivion as the focus of theoretical investigation and exploration in architectural studies. Since most available theories see the built environment as a permanent object of the thinking subject, its theoretical construction is established from a subjective standpoint or worldview. There is a necessity for an alternative theory that sees the built environment as a phenomenon of the daily life-world experience, which happens and gathers people, places, and temporalities systematically and regularly (see Part I figure). These kinds of theories have been considerably marginalized and neglected. This study attempts to unveil and unfold the necessity for such an alternative theory of the built environment beyond Platonism. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Platonism; Prospective theory; The thing; Theoretical question; Vitruvian doctrine,,Book Chapter

This paper presents a review and evaluation of interoperability paradigms in centralized, decentralized, and federated data, and it gives AEC application examples for each approach. It discusses data schemas (e.g. IFC) and interoperability tools (e.g. Speckle, BHoM). It also relates the interoperability tools to semantic web standards that are used to share information. It argues the advantages of federated data interoperability and suggests using design tools that employ such a mechanism. Furthermore, this paper suggests developing modular disciplinary ontologies to support collaborative design tools.

However, existing productivity estimation approaches are carried out in isolation thus limiting the sort of result obtained from such systems. Also, there is yet to be a holistic approach that enables productivity estimation using different metrics and integrates experts' knowledge to predict productivity and guide decision making at the early development stage of a project. This study aims to develop a method that can be used to generate multiple estimations for all these metrics simultaneously through linking their relationships. An ontology-based knowledge modelling approach for estimating productivity at the production stage for OSM projects is proposed. A case study of panel system offsite is used as a proof-of-concept for data collection and knowledge modelling in an ontology. Results from the study through the use of rules and semantic reasoning retrieved cost estimates and time schedule for a panel system production with considerations for different design choices. It is thus proven that systemising the production process knowledge of OSM methods enables practitioners to make informed choices on product design to best suit productivity requirements.

Research showed that providing users with detailed consumption and appliance-usage data may engage them in energy efficiency activities. To do so, data analytic services must be deployed by third parties. These services require a huge amount of data from the users in order to offer high quality services. Nevertheless, users are usually reluctant to share their data especially if its private. This is the case of those measurements performed inside the buildings, as they may be an indicative of the occupants’ behaviour. In these scenarios, data sovereignty plays a key role because it provides to data owners a way to define data usage requirements and verify their compliance in a trustworthy way. In consequence, the owners’ predisposition to exchange their data is expected to increase. This article takes a step forward in the development of a trustworthy ecosystem for the built environment where data sovereignty is provided. Specifically, an approach is proposed to formally specify data usage requirements for the built environment based on ontologies. Furthermore, this approach has been implemented in a real world home use case.

The UK government has long recognised this and is taking the lead towards a more sustainable approach to construction processes. Success towards a more sustainable construction can be achieved if the stakeholders are informed of the new technologies, innovations and knowledge emerging in the sector. Unfortunately, researchers and practitioners have pin-pointed some limitations with the current approaches in the management of knowledge within the construction sector. Interestingly, Semantic Web technologies, the next generation of the Web technologies, can be used to overcome these limitations. Semantic web technologies can considerably improve information representation, sharing and re-use. This paper investigates the extent to which Semantic Web technologies could be used in representing knowledge on emerging sustainable building technologies.

All require high-quality data, methodologies and tools that are able to improve results and to assess and document the implementation processes and outcomes. A challenging key issue in the implementation of a circular economy is ensuring coordination, control and transparency within a network of parties. Traceability models and systems are vital pillars of such an endeavor, but a preliminary search of the available literature revealed a rather unstable and fragmented research field and practice. The objective of this systematic review was to examine those studies discussing traceability models and traceability systems while connecting traceability capacities and outputs to implement the principles of the circular economy. The literature databases were searched on 6 January 2020, with an update for the entire year of 2020. Overall, 49 studies were included. By addressing eight specific research questions, we found that a link between traceability and the circular economy is yet to be established. Sound research and practice documentation are required to establish evidence regarding this connection, including methodologies that are able to support the design and implementation of business-and lifecycle-oriented, value-based traceability models and traceability systems, along with thorough evaluation methods and tools incorporating economic, social and environmental perspectives. © 2022 by the authors.

This book takes up this perennial question, defending the view that philosophy consists of conceptual analysis, construed broadly. Conceptual analysis is understood to involve the search for de re essences, but the book takes up various challenges to this meta-philosophy: that some concepts are merely family resemblance concepts with no definition in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions (""game"", ""language""); that it is impossible to provide sufficient conditions for some philosophically important concepts without circularity (""knowledge"", ""intentional action""); that there exists an unsolved paradox of analysis; that there is no well-defined analytic-synthetic distinction; that names have no definition; and that conceptual analysis is not properly naturalistic. Ultimately, the text finds none of these objections convincing: analysis emerges as both possible and fruitful. At the same time, it rejects the idea of the ""linguistic turn"", arguing that analysis is not directed to language as such, but at reality. Going on to distinguish several types of analysis, with an emphasis on classical decompositional analysis, this book shows different philosophical traditions to be engaged in conceptual analysis when properly understood. Philosophical activity has the kind of value possessed by play, the text claims, which differs from the kind of value possessed by scientific activity. The book concludes with an analytic discussion of the prospects for traditional ontology and the nature of instantiation. © 2012 Oxford University Press.

It is concluded that understanding supposes a fundamental opening; the resurgence of the Greek's notion of truth; the circularity that is part of every act of understanding; the understanding of itself that is present in all philosophically primordial understanding and the notion of language as the home of being. It approaches language as beyond a mere communication tool, since the instrumental reason has led human beings to an unauthentic way or mode of being.

The method consists of segmentation followed by hierarchical classification using object-oriented image analysis and integrating expert knowledge in the form of a local slum ontology. Results show that textural feature contrast derived from a grey-level co-occurrence matrix was useful for delineating segments of slum areas or parts thereof. Spatial metrics such as the size of segments and proportions of vegetation and built-up were used for slum detection. The percentage of agreement between the reference layer and slum classification was 60 percent. This is lower than the accuracy achieved for land cover classification (80.8 percent), due to large variations.

In comparison to green-field construction projects, adaptive reuse projects require distinct stages, definition of interfaces, decision gates, and planning methods in order to secure the success of the building project. Unfortunately, little research has been done regarding establishing feasible systems for the planning, assessment, and management of adaptive reuse projects, leading to underperforming building projects outcomes. Interface management (IM) can improve renovation projects outcomes by defining appropriate ways to identify, record, monitor, and track project interfaces. IM has the potential of bringing cost and time benefits during adaptive reuse projects execution. The aim of this study is to develop a reference framework for implementing IM for adaptive reuse projects. First, the inefficiencies of redevelopment projects are explained inside of a circular economy (CE) context. Second, an ontology of IM for adaptive reuse projects is defined based on the current barriers to adaptive reuse and the most common interface problems in construction projects. Third, the defined ontology is expanded through a case study by showing examples of adaptive reuse barriers on a case project, and how IM could have been part of the solution for these problems.

Even though some technological innovations around Building Information Modeling (BIM) might have the potential to overcome these challenges, data integration across disciplines, companies and software solutions is yet to be solved entirely. Trending advancements try to enrich existing BIM data using Linked Data technologies to semantically describe the building information and facilitate data integration. By that, project data from different data sources is made available in an accessible format, so project participants can use it for their planning efforts. In this paper we explore the use of Linked Building Data (LBD) on a specific use case to answer the question of how the planning of Temporary Construction Items (TCIs) can be improved by integrating data and automating the demand calculation. A literature review concludes that TCIs only experience little attention in the current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the outcome of a project. Thus, the objective of this paper is to develop standard ontologies to provide a semantically rich terminology of the data and to propose a framework for TCI consideration within a BIM based project delivery system. A prototype solution is developed, taking formwork as a TCI representative. The result is a process for automatically creating a TCI utilization plan that quantifies the precise time- and location-based on-site TCI demand by integrating data from BIM, Location-Based Scheduling (LBS) and TCI information. Based on the results of prototyping and findings from expert interviews, this research integrates the solution into the process of construction and finally proposes two implementation scenarios for the solution – one being based on the current industry situation and one exploring the future vision of a more integrated and decentralized project delivery in the construction industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",BIM; Linked Building Data; Temporary construction items,Architectural design; Construction; Construction industry; 'current; Building Information Modelling; Linked building data; Location based; Project complexity; Project environment; Software solution; Technological innovation; Temporary construction; Temporary construction item; Data integration,Review

The main novelties are the introduction of a set of specific dependency patterns and the introduction of a partially revised TRIZ (Russian acronym for “Theory of Inventive Problem Solving”) ontology to classify the retrieved information. The proposed dependency patterns were manually extracted from a sample patents pool about waste recycling and reuse. The classification of the information is based on different classes: (1) what transformations can be carried out on the waste, (2) what technologies can be used to carry out these transformations, (3) what products can be obtained by transforming the waste, (4) what functions can be carried out by the waste, (5) with which technologies, and (6) on which entities. An automatic implementation of the proposed method, involving the manual check of the retrieved results, was tested through a case study about wood chip recycling and reuse. Compared to the dependency patterns from the literature, the proposed ones allowed to retrieve 28 % more pertinent information. This results mainly depends by better ability of the proposed patterns to better discriminate the relevant sentences from which to extract information, compared to the other patterns (i.e. + 40 %).

The goal of the VISI standard is to arrange the cooperation of the parties in construction projects. Application of the VISI standard is not without troubles. The VISI standard is based on the DEMO methodology. We used the Hevner Three Cycle View and Sein’s ADR to understand what and we used interviewing and process mining to understand how the development and use of VISI has been. We conclude that an overall cycle over the three cycle view is necessary to see that the right process is followed in using scientific knowledge to design artifacts that solve practical problems. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Action design research; Action research; Construction sector; DEMO; Design science research; Enterprise engineering; Enterprise ontology; ISO standard; Large infrastructure projects; Process management; VISI,Construction industry; Action research; Construction sectors; DEMO; Design research; Design-science researches; Enterprise engineering; Enterprise ontology; Infrastructure project; ISO standards; Process management; VISI; Project management,Conference Paper

However, in order to increase the economic viability of the obtained microalgae biomass from a production plant coupled to a coal power plant, a proteomic approach was initiated by using fresh and atomized microalgae samples, as the main used commercial forms. Above 51,000 high quality spectra were obtained per sample in the MS/MS analysis of whole proteome of N. gaditana, yielding above 7,500 peptides, leading the identification of 1,950 proteins, from the N. gaditana protein database, where 655 proteins were presented in all the replicates. The identified proteins were categorized according to gene ontology classification by molecular function and biological process. In this study, it has been described the first proteomic analysis of the microalgae N. gaditana under industrial conditions containing an important number of identified proteins. A significative presence of proteins with a potential role in different agri-food and biomedical applications was detected and studied being the core of future N. gaditana research to expand the current biotechnological applications of this microalga. Significance of the study: Three quarters of the planet earth correspond to seas and oceans, however its potential biotechnological use is still unknown. We described the first proteomic description of the microalgae N. gaditana under industrial conditions. Following the spirit of the EU initiatives of blue growth and the statements of circular economy, CO 2 waste from a coal plant power has been transformed in a resource for microalgae biomass production, common product presentations were evaluated by proteomic, and its potential use of identified proteins in Agri-food and Biomedicine has been revealed. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Microalgae; N. gaditana; Non-model organisms; Proteomics,"peptide; proteome; peptide; proteome; Article; biomass production; classification; economic aspect; gene ontology; microbial biomass; Nannochloropsis gaditana; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein database; protein function; proteomics; tandem mass spectrometry; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microalga; protein database; stramenopile; Databases, Protein; Microalgae; Peptides; Proteome; Proteomics; Stramenopiles",Article

Thus, utilizing information systems (IS) in the construction industry has been an issue of great concern in order to achieve competitive advantages of an organization and also to enhance the effectiveness of construction projects throughout their life cycle and across different construction business functions. Nevertheless, despite recent outstanding advancement in building information modeling (BIM) technology, practical BIM implementation has not been widely proven to be economically feasible. It is noteworthy that economic feasibility can encompass quantified intangible benefits from BIM. Therefore, an assessment of BIM deployment from a holistic perspective is required in order to appraise the strategic and managerial advantages in a project or in an organization. Several studies have asserted strategic benefits of BIM adoption focusing on specific application areas (e.g. scheduling or estimating) or addressing limited technologies (e.g. visualization or ontology). However, real-world implementation of information systems truly comprehends complex issues such as corporate strategy, management effectiveness, internal policy and culture, and also technical capability together at the same time. In order to explore these complex issues for effective BIM implementation; this study examines five different real-world cases of BIM implementations. The five case studies from United States, Japan, and South Korea will be analyzed within two major BIM frameworks developed by the author. Project delivery methods, construction business functions, types of integration methods, and level of automation for BIM usage are the most important variables for comparing and analyzing the five cases in terms of BIM benefits. This study describes the different approaches and different benefits that BIM has to offer for practical applications. © 2015 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Competition; Construction industry; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Life cycle; Project management; Real time systems; Construction project management; Information and Communication Technologies; Management effectiveness; Organizational strategy; Project delivery method; Real-world implementation; Role of Information Systems; Technical capabilities; Architectural design,Book Chapter

Cosmos embraces everything, including the multifarious natural and material entities that make humans act. The book examines cosmopolitics in its relation to design practice. Abandoning the modernist idea of nature as being external to the human experience - a nature that can be mastered by engineers and scientists from outside, the cosmpolitical thinking offers designers to embark in an active process of manipulating and reworking nature 'from within.' To engage in cosmopolitics, this book argues, means to redesign, create, instigate, and compose every single feature of our common experience. In the light of this new understanding of nature, we set the questions: What is the role of design if nature is no longer salient enough to provide a background for human activities? How can we foster designers' own force and make present what causes designers to think, feel, and act? How do designers make explicit the connection of humans to a variety of entities with different ontology: rivers, species, particles, materials and forces? How do they redefine political order by bringing together stars, prions and people? In effect, how should we understand design practice in its relation to the material and the living world? In this volume, anthropologists, science studies scholars, political scientists and sociologists rethink together the meaning of cosmopolitics for design. At the same time designers, architects and artists engage with the cosmopolitical question in trying to imagine the future of architectural and urban design. The book contains original empirical chapters and a number of revealing interviews with artists and designers whose practices set examples of 'cosmopolitically correct design'. © Albena Yaneva and Alejandro Zaera-Polo 2015.

The exact methodological principles and systematic rules for a linkage between philosophical theories and neuroscientific hypothesis, however, remain to be clarified. The present contribution focuses on these principles, as well as on the relation between ontology and epistemology and the characterization of hypothesis in neurophilosophy. Principles of transdisciplinary methodology include the ‘principle of asymmetry’, the ‘principle of bi-directionality’ and the ‘principle of transdisciplinary circularity’. The ‘principle of asymmetry’ points to an asymmetric relationship between logical and natural conditions. The ‘principle of bi-directionality’ claims for the necessity of bi-directional linkage between natural and logical conditions. The ‘principle of transdisciplinary circularity’ describes systematic rules for mutual comparison and cross-conditional exchange between philosophical theory and neuroscientific hypotheses. The relation between ontology and epistemology no longer is determined by ontological presuppositions i.e. “ontological primacy”. Instead, there is correspondence between different ‘epistemological capacities’ and different kinds of ontology which consecutively results in “epistemic primacy” and “ontological pluralism”. The present contribution concludes by rejecting some so-called ‘standard-arguments’ including the ‘argument of circularity’, the ‘argument of categorical fallacy’, the ‘argument of validity’ and the ‘argument of necessity’. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Implementation, however, is often controversial. In 2018, a Swedish governmental inquiry was commissioned to propose a complete ban on land application of sewage sludge to reduce soil pollution and increase phosphorus recovery. In 2020, the inquiry suggested two pathways, one to ban all land application, and one where agricultural land use should continuously be allowed. This paper is based on interviews with experts tied to the inquiry where they reference to sewage sludge, related objects, and future management. The inquiry’s inability to propose a coherent suggestion is analysed inspired by the concept of multiple ontology. Several ontological versions of sewage sludge emerge that unveil tensions between concepts of danger and cleanliness, pollution and naturalness, often captured in previous studies of waste. Some versions of sewage sludge conflict, which can explain the difficulty to establish an ontologically singular knowledge base for a transformation of sewage sludge from waste to resource. Though most of the experts agree that circular economy and nutrient recycling are good things, policymaking is caught in an ontological conundrum. © 2022 The Author(s).

In what sense are houses themselves living things? If they live and act, how to conceive of the relationship between built and natural landscapes, and between environment and life more broadly? This article considers three moments at which human geographers have attempted to answer these questions without submitting to visions of environmental causation and constraint favoured by determinists, who dominated the discipline into the early 20th century. The article begins with the work of Carl Sauer, by 1925 the major American figure refuting environmental determinism at a theoretical level and recommending the study of housing as an articulate transcript of human action. It then looks back to the American writings of Friedrich Ratzel, one of several German scholars Sauer canonized, to illuminate a more vitalistic ontology of domestic architecture, and an urbanism, untapped by Sauer when filing his dissent. It then looks ahead to mid-century studies of vernacular architecture – by those of Sauer’s students friendlier to urban life than he was, and by the critic and publisher J. B. Jackson – to assess how this inheritance informed critiques of industrial modernity in the post-war United States. The article observes certain continuities, despite manifest tensions, between ‘old’ and ‘new’ cultural geographies. It also routes a long-standing set of debates concerning the relationship of materiality to meaning – and of spatial to social form – through the case of human geography, a peculiar interstice in the broader constellation of disciplines. © The Author(s) 2020.",built environment; Carl Sauer; Friedrich Ratzel; history of geography; John Brinckerhoff (J.
