The specified solution emerged from a comprehensive analysis of the business and information/knowledge management practices of four construction organizations and makes use of a construction-specific ontology for specifying adaptive mechanisms that can organize documents according to their content and interdependencies while maintaining their overall consistency. The proposed Web-based infrastructure includes services allowing the creation, capture, indexing, retrieval, and dissemination of knowledge. It also promotes the integration of third-party services, including proprietary and legacy tools. The Web-services model is used as the underlying middleware technology that supports the solution.

This paper aims to develop a new information management method to cope with the risk problems involved in dealing with such data, based on domain ontologies of the construction industry, to help manage PPP risks, share and reuse risk knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: Risk knowledge concepts are acquired and summarized through PPP failure cases and an extensive literature review to establish a domain framework for risk knowledge using ontology technology to help manage PPP risks. Findings: The results indicate that the risk ontology is capable of capturing key concepts and relationships involved in managing PPP risks and can be used to facilitate knowledge reuse and storage beneficial to risk management. Research limitations/implications: The classes in the risk knowledge ontology model constructed in this research do not yet cover all the information in PPP project risks and need to be further extended. Moreover, only the framework and basic methods needed are developed, while the construction of a working ontology model and the relationship between implicit and explicit knowledge is a complicated process that requires repeated modifications and evaluations before it can be implemented. Practical implications: The ontology provides a basis for turning PPP risk information into risk knowledge to allow the effective sharing and communication of project risks between different project stakeholders. It can also have the potential to help reduce the dependence on subjectivity by mining, using and storing tacit knowledge in the risk management process. Originality/value: The apparent suitability of the nine classes of PPP risk knowledge (project model, risk type, risk occurrence stage, risk source, risk consequence, risk likelihood, risk carrier, risk management measures and risk case) is identified, and the proposed construction method and steps for a complete domain ontology for PPP risk management are unique. A combination of criteria- and task-based evaluations is also developed for assessing the PPP risk ontology for the first time. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Domain ontology; Project management; Public–private partnership; Risk knowledge; Risk management; Rule-based reasoning,Construction industry; Digital storage; Information management; Ontology; Project management; Risk assessment; Construction projects; Domain ontologies; Ontology model; Ontology-based; Project risk; Public/private partnerships; Risk knowledge; Risk ontologies; Risks management; Rule-based reasoning; Risk management,Article,,,,,,,,2,Good example for Ontologies in Constrcution industry

Scientometric analysis (e.g. co-author, co-word, co-citation, and clusters) objectively visualized the research status quo while a critical review was used to identify the research themes and challenges of ontology research in the construction industry. The results identified a large network of co-authors in this field to understand collaboration relationships. Over half the papers (53%) were published by the following three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The top co-occurring keywords were “project management” at which ontology facilitates knowledge management and information retrieval. When the time factor was taken into consideration, keywords naturally evolved from “project management” and “knowledge management” to “building information modeling” and “compliance control” with the successful adoption of information techniques in the construction industry.

As domain-specific software solutions are expanding their features over different sources and datasets, the need for integration and standardization of information storage and exchange arises. Semantic Web technologies are one of the emerging solutions for solving such issues, as they offer the possibility to combine data from diverse data models and multiple domains using the web. Among the ontologies developed in the last decade for the construction sector, one specific reference should be made on the ifcOWL, an IFC-based ontology representing the most used data schema industry.

Today, with the development of the IFC project model by the IAI, the product modelling paradigm is being rapidly introduced in commercial software as well. However, actual PDT application in the AEC domain is still limited to CAD data exchange and some basic project-centred data management facilities. There is a great need of human-centred product model services supporting the engineer with additional knowledge about the models, providing customisable user-friendly capabilities for management and modification of the data, and enabling structured access to the information on the project(s) he is working on. These issues have motivated the development of an ontology framework that can serve as advanced user gateway to product model data. The suggested approach draws upon recent ICT achievements, especially regarding IFC environments. In this paper we present the rationale, the principal design, and the technical structure of the ontology framework based on the XML schema specification.

Such a framework can also improve the successful accomplishment of building projects. This paper aims to use Semantic Web technologies for facilitating information exchange within existing building projects. Design/methodology/approach: In real-world building projects, the construction industry’s information supply chain may initiate from near scratch when new building projects are started resulting in diverse data structures represented in unstructured data sources, like Excel spreadsheets and documents. Large-scale data generated throughout a building's life-cycle requires exchanging and processing during an asset's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase. Building information modelling (BIM) processes and related technologies can address some of the challenges and limitations of information exchange and interoperability within new building projects. However, the use of BIM in existing and retrofit assets has been hampered by the challenges surrounding the limitations of existing technologies. Findings: The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it briefly outlines the framework previously developed for generating semantically enriched 3D retrofit models. Secondly, a framework is proposed focussing on facilitating the information exchange and interoperability for existing buildings. Semantic Web technologies and standards, such as Web Ontology Language and existing AEC domain ontologies are used to enhance and improve the proposed framework. Originality/value: The proposed framework is evaluated by implementing an example application and the Resource Description Framework data produced by the previously developed framework. The proposed approach makes a valuable contribution to the asset/facilities management (AM/FM) domain. It should be of interest to various FM practices for existing assets, such as the building information/knowledge management for design, construction and O&M stages of an asset’s life-cycle. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Building Information Modelling (BIM); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Information exchange and interoperability; Point Cloud Data (PCD); Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantic Web technologies; Web Ontology Language (OWL),Construction; Construction industry; Information dissemination; Interoperability; Life cycle; Ontology; Retrofitting; Semantic Web; Spreadsheets; Structural design; Supply chains; Building Information Modelling; Design/methodology/approach; Information exchange framework; Information supply chain; Operation and maintenance; Resource description framework; Semantic Web ontologies; Semantic Web technology; Architectural design,Article,,,,,,,,2,Look at AEC domain ontologies - which have been used?

It suggests building material passports as a data source for the materials to be circulated and then integrates them by means of Linked Data.A common language is proposed to combine and re-use the material data in the CE with the creation of two ontologies: Circular Exchange Ontology (CEO) and the Circular Materials and Activities Ontology (CAMO). The ontologies annotate materials under a CE classification scheme and describe the elements required for material exchange to occur: actors, the activities they perform and the referents of these activities (resources, products, tools and waste).An evaluation of the ontologies is made by means of use case-driven SPARQL queries. Further, a wide-scale evaluation addresses how a decentralized data ecosystem can enable users to publish information and dynamically interact with different repositories to exchange materials.

These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference.

The conversion from EXPRESS to OWL is of particular use to the architectural design and construction industry, because one of the key data models in this domain, namely the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), is represented using the EXPRESS information modelling language. These conversion efforts have by now resulted in a recommended ifcOWL ontology that stays semantically close to the EXPRESS schema. Two major improvements could be made in addition to this ifcOWL basis. First, the ontology could be split into diverse modules, making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology. Second, geometric aggregated data (e.g. lists of coordinates) could be serialised into alternative, less complex semantic structures. The purpose of both improvements is to make ifcOWL data smaller in size and complexity. In this article, we focus entirely on the second topic, namely the optimization of geometric data in the semantic representation. We outline and discuss the diverse available options in optimizing the data representations used. We quantify the impact of these measures on the ifcOWL ontology and instance model size. We conclude with an explicit recommendation and give an indication of how this recommendation might be implemented in combination with the already available ifcOWL ontology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",BIM; Data exchange; Geometry; IFC; Linked data; OWL,Architectural design; Birds; Construction industry; Electronic data interchange; Geometry; Modeling languages; Semantics; Aggregated datum; Complex semantic structures; Data representations; Design and construction; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Information modelling; Linked datum; Semantic representation; Ontology,Article,,,,,,,,3,"IFC and ontologies - only necessary to read if ""Express to OWL construction industry: Towards a recommendable and usable ifcOWL ontology"" is useful.

Knowledge management has been hailed as an enabler for tapping this knowledge to improve efficiency in the AEC industry. In this study, the main concepts and benefits of knowledge management, relationships between knowledge management and continuous improvement have been examined. Furthermore, emphasis has been laid on knowledge management through experience feedback processes which constitute valuable assets for the AEC industry. This is done through the employment of ontologies and graph-based reasoning operations in eliciting and visualizing knowledge concepts in the AEC domain. The proposed approach which consists of two main aspects provides the opportunity to examine the conceptual and ontological knowledge models with associated reasoning. In the first, the concepts of knowledge management, their significance and application in the AEC field are discussed. The second deals with a methodological framework for the modeling and reasoning in the domain ontology. To facilitate automation, an ontology graph-based editor, Conceptual Graphs User Interface (CoGui) was used to model knowledge and encoded reasoning in the knowledge base. CoGui encodes knowledge as conceptual graphs and reasoning as graph operations that can be visualized in a logically precise way, based on domain ontologies. It emerged that CoGui could be very useful in acquiring information that can be used in collaboration with others to continuously improve information sharing and re-use. A French AEC company located in the Southwest region was employed as a case study in illustrating knowledge modeling through the experience feedback process. For each phase of experience feedback, actions that were implemented in the company are discussed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The building and construction domain is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information between actors. For example, semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, are problems fundamentally created through the employment of representations to map the ‘world’ into models in an endeavour to anticipate different actors’ views, vocabulary, and objectives. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work is the process of formalization and representation of document content, where most existing approaches are limited in their capability and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched by incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (the Semantic Associations) modelled by domain ontologies combined with the information presented in documents, thereby providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework for representation of knowledge sources, where each knowledge source is semantically represented (within its domain of use) by a Semantic Vector. This work contributes to the enrichment of Semantic Vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support, employing ontology concepts and their relations in the enrichment process. The test bed for the assessment of the approach is the Building and Construction industry, using an appropriateB&CdomainOntology. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications.

The use of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) has been proposed to help address the lack of interoperability throughout construction industry.

This paper proposes a semantic Web Services framework utilizing IFC-based industry ontology to address the interoperability problem.

Both a core service and an assistant service is included. The framework could be easily expanded as long as the same Web Services model and the common ontology is observed. Once implemented, the framework could be utilized by any IFC-supported BIM applications, as well as personnel without extensive knowledge of IFC specifications, for more precise, consistent and up-to-date project information retrieval.

Architecture, engineering, and construction industry spends time and money to solve the information sharing and interoperability issues between different domains. With the advent of building information modeling, a 3D CAD model of a project is used as a shared knowledge resource during the design, construction, and facility management phases of a project's life cycle. Currently, 4D models are created by combining CAD and schedule information. A 4D model is useful for detecting potential construction conflicts during the project planning and design and a valuable tool during construction. However, creating 4D models requires a great amount of human involvement. An approach that facilitates integrating BIM and schedule information can improve efficiency and is highly desirable. This paper presents a new approach to information modeling using the Semantic Web technology. The Semantic Web provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that allows computers to access and combine information distributed over the Internet. The paper discusses: (1) ontologies that the authors have developed for BIM and project schedule information; (2) how ontologies are used for creating project knowledge bases in RDF/OWL format; and (3) how project knowledge bases can facilitate machine processing of project information and semantic interoperability among project knowledge bases. The Semantic Web approach allows information to be saved once at the provider source and be used by authorized users as needed. This means BIM information is created and maintained by designers and project schedule is created and maintained by schedulers on their respective servers. This would allow the latest BIM and project schedule information to be accessed over the Internet and combined for various purposes. © ASCE.",,"Architectural design; Budget control; Computer aided design; Construction industry; Information analysis; Information management; Information theory; Information use; Internet; Interoperability; Life cycle; Office buildings; Semantic Web; Architecture , engineering , and constructions; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction projects; Information Modeling; Project informations; Semantic interoperability; Semantic web approach; Semantic Web technology; Project management",Conference Paper,,,,,,,,3,Look at point (2) how ontologies are used for creating project knowledge bases in RDF/OWL format

This study identifies similarities between the industry foundation classes and ontology likewise their differences with the hope that it would develop an enhanced knowledge conceptualization of the domain.

However, different use scenarios may only require access to certain specific information stored in the model. In contrast with the ample research of ontology applications in construction knowledge management, research of ontology in construction modeling has been limited. Hence, the purpose of this study is to use ontology in the extraction of a partial building information model from the original complete model. The building information models covered in this study are in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format, which is a widely supported open BIM standard. An ontology TBox is developed according to the existing IFC schema specifications. For each specific IFC model, an ontology ABox is generated at run time, combining the ontology TBox and the IFC instances in the model. The ABox works as an index in the partial model extraction algorithm. A prototype Java program based on the algorithm was developed to demonstrate and validate the algorithm using both a sample model and an IFC model from a real building.

A systematic process employing three-phase search method, objective analysis and subjective analysis, helps to provide enough potential articles related to construction ontology research, and to reduce arbitrariness and subjectivity involved in research topic analysis. As a result, three main research topics aligned with the ontology development lifecycle were derived as follows: information integration based on ontology, ontology building, and ontology application. In addition, research gaps and the corresponding research agenda were identified. This detailed review provides the basis for further studies on the use of ontology in the construction industry. The research trends and gaps can serve as motivation for researchers and practitioners to work on the next generation of ontology studies to support the development of the construction industry. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Cluster analysis; Construction industry; Information interoperability; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Semantic web; Word cloud,Cluster analysis; Construction industry; Interoperability; Knowledge representation; Ontology; Semantic Web; Information integration; Information interoperability; Information re use; Ontology applications; Ontology development; Subjective analysis; Systematic process; Word clouds; Information use,Article,,,,,,,,1,Overview over ontologies in the construction industry

Properly managing, exchanging and exploiting these data is an ever ongoing challenge in this domain. This has resulted in large semantic RDF graphs that are to be combined with a significant number of other data sets (building product catalogues, regulation data, geometric point cloud data, simulation data, sensor data), thus making an already huge dataset even larger. Making these big data available at high performance rates and speeds and into the correct (intuitive) formats is therefore an incredibly high challenge in this domain. Yet, hardly any benchmark is available for this industry that (1) gives an overview of the kind of data typically handled in this domain; and (2) that lists the query and reasoning performance results in handling these data. In this article, we therefore present a set of available sample data that explicates the scale of the situation, and we additionally perform a query and reasoning performance benchmark. This results not only in an initial set of quantitative performance results, but also in recommendations in implementing a web-based system relying heavily on large semantic data. As such, we propose an initial benchmark through which new upcoming data management proposals in the architectural design and construction domains can be measured. © 2016 ACM.",Benchmark; Big data; Building information modeling; Built environment; IFC; OWL; Reasoning; Semantic web,Architectural design; Benchmarking; Data handling; Information management; Semantic Web; Building Information Model - BIM; Building products; Built environment; Design and construction; Large scale buildings; Point cloud data; Reasoning; Reasoning performance; Big data,Conference Paper,,,,,,,,2,V as Variety - paper looks at different data handled in CI BigData.

However, this interest remains largely academic and has not sparked much adoption of web technologies in the field. To nourish adoption of Linked Data in practice, access to the data has to be made more easy. SPARQL, the recommended RDF query language, has proven very powerful for retrieving and updating RDF datasets. However, due to its verbosity and complexity, it is often considered a threshold for developers to implement in their tools. In this paper, we compare SPARQL with Linked Data querying languages that extend the GraphQL syntax, in context of querying building datasets: HyperGraphQL and GraphQL-LD. Since it went open source in 2015, GraphQL has been adopted by a large community of developers, partly due to its elegance and conciseness. As a use case, the queries are performed on an RDF-based multi-model that relies on the recent ISO standard ICDD (ISO 21597). ICDD interlinks information on a sub-document identifier level, based on OWL. It is aimed at the industry in that it adds a layer of Linked Data to documentation formats that are still widely used in practice: IFC, spreadsheets, imagery etc. Therefore, it is considered a tuned use case for comparing these different RDF query languages. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

As the building data is now available in a semantic graph with an explicit formal basis, it can be restructured and simplified so that it more easily matches the different requirements associated with practical use case scenarios.

To reach this goal, it is necessary to use open standards for model exchange such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The non-profit organization buildingSMART defines this standard. IFC provides object types and attributes, which describe properties of objects. The IFC standard do not address possible values for attributes; but beside coordinated names for object types and attributes, coordinated values for attributes are required. This is necessary for the evaluation of digital models for different purposes. Several approaches in the fields of ontology and classification systems address this issue. However, at present time there is no clear distinction between prerequisites that modeled objects have to fulfill and products, which satisfy these requirements. Suppliers or construction companies at the interface between planning and construction propose products for the modelled requirements of the planning process. This paper describes an approach that bases on a dictionary, which provides standardized object types, attributes and values. A project database and a database with products, called supplier database, use this dictionary as a basis. Resulting from the modeling phase, the project database is ultimately mapped with the supplier database to propose products that fulfill the requirements. The approach presented in this paper can be regarded as a next step in using a standard that already exists: the buildingSMART Data Dictionary. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Building Information Modeling (BIM); BuildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC),Construction industry; Database systems; Information theory; Intelligent computing; Building Information Model - BIM; BuildingSMART Data Dictionary (bSDD); Classification system; Construction companies; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Interorganizational collaboration; Non profit organizations; Project database; Architectural design,Conference Paper,,,,,,,,3,"Look into BuildingSMART Data dictionnary - acutally more relevant for Zirkular, than for thesis"

An ontology is filled with transformation processes; then, several alternative paths are generated and assessed, according to a potentially available waste. The resulting list is classified according to pre-established parameters, thus presenting which are the potentially best alternatives to close the material loops and recover chemical resources.

As a result, one physical object yields several disciplinary representations, allowing designers to describe design options discipline-specifically and thus explore design differently. In a co-design approach, data from disciplines must be integrated and interoperable. But in current practice, interoperability problems between different software often hinders data integration. This paper presents a review and evaluation of interoperability paradigms in centralized, decentralized, and federated data, and it gives AEC application examples for each approach. It discusses data schemas (e.g. IFC) and interoperability tools (e.g. Speckle, BHoM). It also relates the interoperability tools to semantic web standards that are used to share information. It argues the advantages of federated data interoperability and suggests using design tools that employ such a mechanism. Furthermore, this paper suggests developing modular disciplinary ontologies to support collaborative design tools.

Success towards a more sustainable construction can be achieved if the stakeholders are informed of the new technologies, innovations and knowledge emerging in the sector. Unfortunately, researchers and practitioners have pin-pointed some limitations with the current approaches in the management of knowledge within the construction sector. Interestingly, Semantic Web technologies, the next generation of the Web technologies, can be used to overcome these limitations. Semantic web technologies can considerably improve information representation, sharing and re-use. This paper investigates the extent to which Semantic Web technologies could be used in representing knowledge on emerging sustainable building technologies.

In comparison to green-field construction projects, adaptive reuse projects require distinct stages, definition of interfaces, decision gates, and planning methods in order to secure the success of the building project. Unfortunately, little research has been done regarding establishing feasible systems for the planning, assessment, and management of adaptive reuse projects, leading to underperforming building projects outcomes. Interface management (IM) can improve renovation projects outcomes by defining appropriate ways to identify, record, monitor, and track project interfaces. IM has the potential of bringing cost and time benefits during adaptive reuse projects execution. The aim of this study is to develop a reference framework for implementing IM for adaptive reuse projects. First, the inefficiencies of redevelopment projects are explained inside of a circular economy (CE) context. Second, an ontology of IM for adaptive reuse projects is defined based on the current barriers to adaptive reuse and the most common interface problems in construction projects. Third, the defined ontology is expanded through a case study by showing examples of adaptive reuse barriers on a case project, and how IM could have been part of the solution for these problems. Finally, this study concludes with the suggestions on interface management systems (IMS) implementation for future adaptive reuse projects. © 2019 by the authors.",Adaptive reuse of buildings; Barriers in adaptive reuse projects; Circular economy; Interface management system; Interface problems in construction projects,,Article,,,,,,,,1,IMPORTANT - Paper about Ontology for adaptive reuse.
