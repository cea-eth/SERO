This study proposes a methodology based on a chain of tools to enable structural engineers to anticipate future reuse. This methodology describes the design of reversible assemblies, the addition of complementary information in the building information modeling (BIM), reinforced traceability, and the development of a material bank. At the same time, controlling the environmental impacts of reuse is planned by carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) at all stages of the project. Two scenarios for reuse design are applied with the toolchain proposed. A. ""design from a stock"" scenario, which leads to 100% of elements being reused, using only elements from stock. B. ""design with a stock"" scenario, which seeks to integrate as many reused elements available in the stock as possible. The case study of a high-rise building deconstructed to rebuild a medium-rise building demonstrated that the developed toolchain allowed the inclusion of all reuse elements in a new structural calculation model. © 2020 by the authors.",Building circular economy; Building information modeling (BIM); Design for reuse; Embodied energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Reuse of materials; Sustainable construction,bearing capacity; building construction; database; design method; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; loading test; structural analysis,Article,,,,,,,,2,Reuse of structural/ load bearing elements and BIM

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables. Therefore, the authors suggest utilizing the approach developed in this research to promote the circularity of materials in different subsectors of the construction industry. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Building structure; Economic reusability; Gaussian process regression; K-nearest neighbors; Random forest; Supervised machine learning,Bearings (machine parts); Building components; Construction industry; Economic analysis; Predictive analytics; Probability; Reusability; Sensitivity analysis; Supervised learning; Wages; Building structural; Economic factors; Predictive modeling; Probability theory; Procurement process; Structural elements; Supervised machine learning; Visualization technique; Learning systems,Article,,,,,,,,1,Economic reusability of load bearing elements - set of information for reuse

Adaptive reuse has the potential to maximize the residual utility and value of existing assets through green design methods such as selective disassembly planning. Studies in the field of selective disassembly are scarce and there is no evidence of established methodologies for the optimization of the environmental and financial benefits. A multi-objective analysis is key to obtaining several effective selective disassembly plans for the adaptive reuse of an existing asset through the combination of different deconstruction methods. The analysis is carried out in terms of the physical, environmental, and economic constraints of the deconstruction methods per building component. The Sequential Disassembly Planning for Buildings (SDPB) method is used in order to generate the optimized disassembly plans for retrieving target components. At the end, a weighted multi-objective optimization analysis is incorporated to generate the set of noninferior solutions that minimizes environmental impacts and building cost. The results show that different complete disassembly plans exist for all the possible combinations. The possible combinations are driven by the deconstruction methods per component, as well as the dismantling interdependence. The method described in this study can be used to improve the project outcomes according to specific goals and constraints (e.g. environmental, economic, technical).

Structural work and foundations represent the majority of the embodied energy of a building. The research effort is therefore focused on the structural elements. Reuse is here defined as the reuse of an element without transformation, unlike recycling which induces a new industrial cycle. It is therefore about reducing the consumption of materials and lowering GHG emissions. Today, it is impossible in France to reuse structures because of responsibilities, insurance and lack of traceability. How to make possible the reuse of structural components in order to reach a low carbon building? The challenge of this work is to find the best structural configuration making the components reuse easier at the EOL. The methodology we are implementing aims to design the structural elements by increasing the BIM parameters (6D, LCA), to attach the mechanical information, material durability, ageing to each object of the digital mock-up. A digital and physical traceability makes it possible to follow the evolution of the element over the years and to feed a database. At the end of its life the database is accessible and searchable for the design of a future building. A development of tools and gateways will then allow from a model of calculation to go to query the database to find an element resulting from the deconstruction that can be reused in the future structure. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

By contrasting their building-specific features, it demonstrates the benefits and drawbacks of particular structural elements and envelope solutions and ecological aspects using various system boundaries of life-cycle assessment (LCA). Following a careful consideration of ecological factors and sustainable circular economy criteria, a structural component that is sustainably optimized is defined. This component should be chosen based on external conditions. By selecting environmentally friendly building materials and proper connecting procedures that enable separability, resource-efficient and sustainable buildings can be achieved. Both the selection of load-bearing elements and the necessary insulating material have a significant impact on the ecological performance and reusability options of the components. The elements of homogeneity, separability, and pollutantfreeness play a significant influence in the reuse process, namely in terms of details and construction type in general, as well as the ways of reusing and recycling them. Sustainable solutions for load-bearing building components can be created by simultaneously investigating environmentally friendly building materials and the structure of the components. This paper illustrates how the natural resources can be used both optimally and sustainably. It presents a conceptual framework for scenario development of the LCA of load-bearing structures, their effect on the design and decision-making process. There is a potential of increasing total resource efficiency at the building level with a suitable combination of the material components employed at the component level. Because of this, the overall energy efficiency and its consequent ecological impacts are the main topics of this study. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Results show that the production of the load-bearing system would account for 40% of the global warming potential indicator. The slabs are responsible for 65% of the environmental impacts among all structural elements and should be considered for reuse first. Compared to traditional constructions built from first-use material, a fictitious reuse of undamaged load-bearing components over three consecutive use cycles would reduce the global warming potential indicator by 25%. The global warming potential of reuse is eventually computed according to three repartition methods, highlighting the need to separate the life-cycle footprints related to production, use, and end-of-life more systematically. © PLEA 2018.All rights reserved.",Building life cycle assessment; Net zero energy building; Reuse,Environmental impact; Global warming; Office buildings; Environmental benefits; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Load-bearing components; Load-bearing systems; Preliminary design; Structural elements; Traditional constructions; Life cycle,Conference Paper,,,,,,,,3,Introduction and Context - underline why important to reuse strucutral elements (in terms of CO2-savings)

An efficient response from the building sector requires research aimed at the minimisation of the environmental impact of buildings throughout their life cycle, from construction to demolition. The end of a buildings service life can critically influence the total environmental impact, particularly with building technologies such as steel construction. The purpose of the current research was the assessment of the environmental impact caused by different end-of-life scenarios as can be applied to steel buildings. An existing residential steel building is used for the calculations, while the results allow for the comparison between the different end scenarios concerning the main structural materials used, namely the structural steel. Conclusions drawn include the formation of a clear perspective on the environmental impact benefits that can be achieved at the end of a steel buildings life cycle and the positive effects of the steel construction technology as applied to building projects in terms of environmental sustainability.

This causes global warming and waste problems. The demand for the reuse of construction materials is increasing, although it is not the convention, to reduce the environmental impact. Although the sustainable effect of the reuse of materials has been proven in several studies, materials are not always reused in practice, owing to the lack of an information system for reusable materials and the economic uncertainty. In this study, we propose a framework for designing structures using reusable steel beams. The design framework consists of a material bank and a design support tool. The material bank provides information on reusable materials based on the building information modeling. The design support tool generates efficient material procurement plans and provides information about the environmental and economic impact of the project. In a case study used to verify the framework, CO2 emissions were reduced by up to 77% through material reuse, which was consistent with the results of previous studies. However, owing to the cost of processing reusable materials, the overall cost was found to increase by up to about 40%. Therefore, an economic analysis over the entire life cycle when using reusable materials needs to be done. © 2020 by the authors.

It consumes more than half of the total global resources; it is responsible for more than a third of the total global energy use and associated emissions; and generates the greatest and most voluminous waste stream globally. Reuse is considered to be a material and carbon saving practice highly recommended in the construction sector as it can address both waste and carbon emission regulatory targets. This practice offers the possibility to conserve resources through the reclamation of structural components and the carbon embedded in them, as well as opportunities for the development of new business models and the creation of environmental, economic, technical and social value. This paper focuses on the identification and analysis of existing interventions that can promote the reuse of construction components, and outlines the barriers and opportunities arising from this practice as depicted from the global literature. The main conclusions that derive from this study are that the combination of incentives that promote reuse of construction components and recycling of the rest of the construction materials with the provision of specialised education, skills and training would transform the way construction sector currently operates and create opportunities for new business development. Moreover, a typology system developed based on the properties and lifetime of construction components is required in order to provide transparency and guidance in the way construction components are used and reused, in order to make them readily available to designers and contractors. Smart technologies carry the potential to aid the development and uptake of this system by enabling efficient tracking, storage and archiving, while providing information relevant to the environmental and economic savings that can be regained, enabling also better decision-making during construction and deconstruction works. However, further research is required in order to investigate the opportunities and constraints of the use of these technologies. © 2015 The Authors.",Construction and demolition waste (CDW); Construction components; Infrastructure; Interventions; Reuse,Construction industry; Decision making; Demolition; Construction and demolition waste; Construction sectors; Infrastructure; Interventions; New business development; New business models; Reuse; Structural component; Environmental technology; construction; demolition; infrastructure; recycling; structural component; waste; building industry; building material; commercial phenomena; construction work; cost control; decision making; environmental health; environmental protection; priority journal; professional development; recycling; Review; solid waste management; technology,Review,,,,,,,,3,"Introduction - Barriers and Opportunities of Reuse - see if paper links to other papers, such as ""Components reuse in the building sector – A systematic review"" Rakhshan et al., as well as Rose & Stegmann (E-Bamb)"

A third strategy is currently (re)emerging: The reuse of structural components over multiple service lives and in new layouts. Still in its infancy, this circular economy strategy disrupts structural design practice in many ways: Rather than manufacturing components after the design of a system, the system is synthesised from a given stock of reclaimed components; versatility, reversibility and transformability become hard requirements for all loadbearing systems and components; costs, performance and environmental assessments span multiple service lifecycles. There is consequently a sudden lack of expertise, design tools, technological solutions and relevant metrics.

Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks.
