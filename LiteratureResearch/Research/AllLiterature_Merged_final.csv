This study proposes a methodology based on a chain of tools to enable structural engineers to anticipate future reuse. This methodology describes the design of reversible assemblies, the addition of complementary information in the building information modeling (BIM), reinforced traceability, and the development of a material bank. At the same time, controlling the environmental impacts of reuse is planned by carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) at all stages of the project. Two scenarios for reuse design are applied with the toolchain proposed. A. ""design from a stock"" scenario, which leads to 100% of elements being reused, using only elements from stock. B. ""design with a stock"" scenario, which seeks to integrate as many reused elements available in the stock as possible. The case study of a high-rise building deconstructed to rebuild a medium-rise building demonstrated that the developed toolchain allowed the inclusion of all reuse elements in a new structural calculation model. © 2020 by the authors.",Building circular economy; Building information modeling (BIM); Design for reuse; Embodied energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Reuse of materials; Sustainable construction,bearing capacity; building construction; database; design method; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; loading test; structural analysis,Article,,2.0,Reuse of structural/ load bearing elements and BIM,

This paper aims to develop a new information management method to cope with the risk problems involved in dealing with such data, based on domain ontologies of the construction industry, to help manage PPP risks, share and reuse risk knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: Risk knowledge concepts are acquired and summarized through PPP failure cases and an extensive literature review to establish a domain framework for risk knowledge using ontology technology to help manage PPP risks. Findings: The results indicate that the risk ontology is capable of capturing key concepts and relationships involved in managing PPP risks and can be used to facilitate knowledge reuse and storage beneficial to risk management. Research limitations/implications: The classes in the risk knowledge ontology model constructed in this research do not yet cover all the information in PPP project risks and need to be further extended. Moreover, only the framework and basic methods needed are developed, while the construction of a working ontology model and the relationship between implicit and explicit knowledge is a complicated process that requires repeated modifications and evaluations before it can be implemented. Practical implications: The ontology provides a basis for turning PPP risk information into risk knowledge to allow the effective sharing and communication of project risks between different project stakeholders. It can also have the potential to help reduce the dependence on subjectivity by mining, using and storing tacit knowledge in the risk management process. Originality/value: The apparent suitability of the nine classes of PPP risk knowledge (project model, risk type, risk occurrence stage, risk source, risk consequence, risk likelihood, risk carrier, risk management measures and risk case) is identified, and the proposed construction method and steps for a complete domain ontology for PPP risk management are unique. A combination of criteria- and task-based evaluations is also developed for assessing the PPP risk ontology for the first time. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Domain ontology; Project management; Public–private partnership; Risk knowledge; Risk management; Rule-based reasoning,Construction industry; Digital storage; Information management; Ontology; Project management; Risk assessment; Construction projects; Domain ontologies; Ontology model; Ontology-based; Project risk; Public/private partnerships; Risk knowledge; Risk ontologies; Risks management; Rule-based reasoning; Risk management,Article,,2.0,Good example for Ontologies in Constrcution industry,

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables. Therefore, the authors suggest utilizing the approach developed in this research to promote the circularity of materials in different subsectors of the construction industry. © 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Building structure; Economic reusability; Gaussian process regression; K-nearest neighbors; Random forest; Supervised machine learning,Bearings (machine parts); Building components; Construction industry; Economic analysis; Predictive analytics; Probability; Reusability; Sensitivity analysis; Supervised learning; Wages; Building structural; Economic factors; Predictive modeling; Probability theory; Procurement process; Structural elements; Supervised machine learning; Visualization technique; Learning systems,Article,,1.0,Economic reusability of load bearing elements - set of information for reuse,

Scientometric analysis (e.g. co-author, co-word, co-citation, and clusters) objectively visualized the research status quo while a critical review was used to identify the research themes and challenges of ontology research in the construction industry. The results identified a large network of co-authors in this field to understand collaboration relationships. Over half the papers (53%) were published by the following three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The top co-occurring keywords were “project management” at which ontology facilitates knowledge management and information retrieval. When the time factor was taken into consideration, keywords naturally evolved from “project management” and “knowledge management” to “building information modeling” and “compliance control” with the successful adoption of information techniques in the construction industry. Four research themes were identified with the combination of cluster analysis and critical review: “Domain ontology” “Industry foundation classes” “Automated compliance checking” and “Building information modeling”.

Adaptive reuse has the potential to maximize the residual utility and value of existing assets through green design methods such as selective disassembly planning. Studies in the field of selective disassembly are scarce and there is no evidence of established methodologies for the optimization of the environmental and financial benefits. A multi-objective analysis is key to obtaining several effective selective disassembly plans for the adaptive reuse of an existing asset through the combination of different deconstruction methods. The analysis is carried out in terms of the physical, environmental, and economic constraints of the deconstruction methods per building component. The Sequential Disassembly Planning for Buildings (SDPB) method is used in order to generate the optimized disassembly plans for retrieving target components. At the end, a weighted multi-objective optimization analysis is incorporated to generate the set of noninferior solutions that minimizes environmental impacts and building cost. The results show that different complete disassembly plans exist for all the possible combinations. The possible combinations are driven by the deconstruction methods per component, as well as the dismantling interdependence. The method described in this study can be used to improve the project outcomes according to specific goals and constraints (e.g. environmental, economic, technical).

The innovations in digital technologies in Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) sector are not just related to the enhancement of consolidated processes, but they open new collaboration methods and integration with other Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as Internet of Things (IoT), additive manufacturing, automation, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. As domain-specific software solutions are expanding their features over different sources and datasets, the need for integration and standardization of information storage and exchange arises. Semantic Web technologies are one of the emerging solutions for solving such issues, as they offer the possibility to combine data from diverse data models and multiple domains using the web. Among the ontologies developed in the last decade for the construction sector, one specific reference should be made on the ifcOWL, an IFC-based ontology representing the most used data schema industry. Nonetheless, from the standardization point of view, so far ontologies have not been considered among the standard methods for information exchange in the AEC, unlike in other sectors (e.g. ISO 15926 was firstly developed for the integration of life cycle data for process plants of oil and gas facilities).

Today, with the development of the IFC project model by the IAI, the product modelling paradigm is being rapidly introduced in commercial software as well. However, actual PDT application in the AEC domain is still limited to CAD data exchange and some basic project-centred data management facilities. There is a great need of human-centred product model services supporting the engineer with additional knowledge about the models, providing customisable user-friendly capabilities for management and modification of the data, and enabling structured access to the information on the project(s) he is working on. These issues have motivated the development of an ontology framework that can serve as advanced user gateway to product model data. The suggested approach draws upon recent ICT achievements, especially regarding IFC environments. In this paper we present the rationale, the principal design, and the technical structure of the ontology framework based on the XML schema specification.

Open standard SAWSDL is used to annotate web service descriptions with pointers to concepts defined in ontologies. NoSQL database Cassandra is used for distributed data storage among construction supply chain stakeholders. Findings - Ontology can be used to support heterogeneous data transfer and integration through web services. Distributed data storage facilitates data sharing and enhances data control. Practical implications - This paper presents examples of two ontologies for expressing construction supply chain information - ontology for material and ontology for purchase order.

Such a framework can also improve the successful accomplishment of building projects. This paper aims to use Semantic Web technologies for facilitating information exchange within existing building projects. Design/methodology/approach: In real-world building projects, the construction industry’s information supply chain may initiate from near scratch when new building projects are started resulting in diverse data structures represented in unstructured data sources, like Excel spreadsheets and documents. Large-scale data generated throughout a building's life-cycle requires exchanging and processing during an asset's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase. Building information modelling (BIM) processes and related technologies can address some of the challenges and limitations of information exchange and interoperability within new building projects. However, the use of BIM in existing and retrofit assets has been hampered by the challenges surrounding the limitations of existing technologies. Findings: The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it briefly outlines the framework previously developed for generating semantically enriched 3D retrofit models. Secondly, a framework is proposed focussing on facilitating the information exchange and interoperability for existing buildings. Semantic Web technologies and standards, such as Web Ontology Language and existing AEC domain ontologies are used to enhance and improve the proposed framework. Originality/value: The proposed framework is evaluated by implementing an example application and the Resource Description Framework data produced by the previously developed framework. The proposed approach makes a valuable contribution to the asset/facilities management (AM/FM) domain. It should be of interest to various FM practices for existing assets, such as the building information/knowledge management for design, construction and O&M stages of an asset’s life-cycle. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Building Information Modelling (BIM); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Information exchange and interoperability; Point Cloud Data (PCD); Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantic Web technologies; Web Ontology Language (OWL),Construction; Construction industry; Information dissemination; Interoperability; Life cycle; Ontology; Retrofitting; Semantic Web; Spreadsheets; Structural design; Supply chains; Building Information Modelling; Design/methodology/approach; Information exchange framework; Information supply chain; Operation and maintenance; Resource description framework; Semantic Web ontologies; Semantic Web technology; Architectural design,Article,,2.0,Look at AEC domain ontologies - which have been used?,

It suggests building material passports as a data source for the materials to be circulated and then integrates them by means of Linked Data.A common language is proposed to combine and re-use the material data in the CE with the creation of two ontologies: Circular Exchange Ontology (CEO) and the Circular Materials and Activities Ontology (CAMO). The ontologies annotate materials under a CE classification scheme and describe the elements required for material exchange to occur: actors, the activities they perform and the referents of these activities (resources, products, tools and waste).An evaluation of the ontologies is made by means of use case-driven SPARQL queries. Further, a wide-scale evaluation addresses how a decentralized data ecosystem can enable users to publish information and dynamically interact with different repositories to exchange materials. Results indicate that these ontologies can foster a circulation medium between diverse construction industry resources.

Structural work and foundations represent the majority of the embodied energy of a building. The research effort is therefore focused on the structural elements. Reuse is here defined as the reuse of an element without transformation, unlike recycling which induces a new industrial cycle. It is therefore about reducing the consumption of materials and lowering GHG emissions. Today, it is impossible in France to reuse structures because of responsibilities, insurance and lack of traceability. How to make possible the reuse of structural components in order to reach a low carbon building? The challenge of this work is to find the best structural configuration making the components reuse easier at the EOL. The methodology we are implementing aims to design the structural elements by increasing the BIM parameters (6D, LCA), to attach the mechanical information, material durability, ageing to each object of the digital mock-up. A digital and physical traceability makes it possible to follow the evolution of the element over the years and to feed a database. At the end of its life the database is accessible and searchable for the design of a future building. A development of tools and gateways will then allow from a model of calculation to go to query the database to find an element resulting from the deconstruction that can be reused in the future structure. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology.

By contrasting their building-specific features, it demonstrates the benefits and drawbacks of particular structural elements and envelope solutions and ecological aspects using various system boundaries of life-cycle assessment (LCA). Following a careful consideration of ecological factors and sustainable circular economy criteria, a structural component that is sustainably optimized is defined. This component should be chosen based on external conditions. By selecting environmentally friendly building materials and proper connecting procedures that enable separability, resource-efficient and sustainable buildings can be achieved. Both the selection of load-bearing elements and the necessary insulating material have a significant impact on the ecological performance and reusability options of the components. The elements of homogeneity, separability, and pollutantfreeness play a significant influence in the reuse process, namely in terms of details and construction type in general, as well as the ways of reusing and recycling them. Sustainable solutions for load-bearing building components can be created by simultaneously investigating environmentally friendly building materials and the structure of the components. This paper illustrates how the natural resources can be used both optimally and sustainably. It presents a conceptual framework for scenario development of the LCA of load-bearing structures, their effect on the design and decision-making process. There is a potential of increasing total resource efficiency at the building level with a suitable combination of the material components employed at the component level. Because of this, the overall energy efficiency and its consequent ecological impacts are the main topics of this study. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The conversion from EXPRESS to OWL is of particular use to the architectural design and construction industry, because one of the key data models in this domain, namely the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), is represented using the EXPRESS information modelling language. These conversion efforts have by now resulted in a recommended ifcOWL ontology that stays semantically close to the EXPRESS schema. Two major improvements could be made in addition to this ifcOWL basis. First, the ontology could be split into diverse modules, making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology. Second, geometric aggregated data (e.g. lists of coordinates) could be serialised into alternative, less complex semantic structures. The purpose of both improvements is to make ifcOWL data smaller in size and complexity. In this article, we focus entirely on the second topic, namely the optimization of geometric data in the semantic representation. We outline and discuss the diverse available options in optimizing the data representations used. We quantify the impact of these measures on the ifcOWL ontology and instance model size. We conclude with an explicit recommendation and give an indication of how this recommendation might be implemented in combination with the already available ifcOWL ontology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",BIM; Data exchange; Geometry; IFC; Linked data; OWL,Architectural design; Birds; Construction industry; Electronic data interchange; Geometry; Modeling languages; Semantics; Aggregated datum; Complex semantic structures; Data representations; Design and construction; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Information modelling; Linked datum; Semantic representation; Ontology,Article,,3.0,"IFC and ontologies - only necessary to read if ""Express to OWL construction industry: Towards a recommendable and usable ifcOWL ontology"" is useful.

The slabs are responsible for 65% of the environmental impacts among all structural elements and should be considered for reuse first. Compared to traditional constructions built from first-use material, a fictitious reuse of undamaged load-bearing components over three consecutive use cycles would reduce the global warming potential indicator by 25%.

An efficient response from the building sector requires research aimed at the minimisation of the environmental impact of buildings throughout their life cycle, from construction to demolition. The end of a buildings service life can critically influence the total environmental impact, particularly with building technologies such as steel construction. The purpose of the current research was the assessment of the environmental impact caused by different end-of-life scenarios as can be applied to steel buildings. An existing residential steel building is used for the calculations, while the results allow for the comparison between the different end scenarios concerning the main structural materials used, namely the structural steel. Conclusions drawn include the formation of a clear perspective on the environmental impact benefits that can be achieved at the end of a steel buildings life cycle and the positive effects of the steel construction technology as applied to building projects in terms of environmental sustainability.

Knowledge management has been hailed as an enabler for tapping this knowledge to improve efficiency in the AEC industry. In this study, the main concepts and benefits of knowledge management, relationships between knowledge management and continuous improvement have been examined. Furthermore, emphasis has been laid on knowledge management through experience feedback processes which constitute valuable assets for the AEC industry. This is done through the employment of ontologies and graph-based reasoning operations in eliciting and visualizing knowledge concepts in the AEC domain. The proposed approach which consists of two main aspects provides the opportunity to examine the conceptual and ontological knowledge models with associated reasoning. In the first, the concepts of knowledge management, their significance and application in the AEC field are discussed. The second deals with a methodological framework for the modeling and reasoning in the domain ontology. To facilitate automation, an ontology graph-based editor, Conceptual Graphs User Interface (CoGui) was used to model knowledge and encoded reasoning in the knowledge base. CoGui encodes knowledge as conceptual graphs and reasoning as graph operations that can be visualized in a logically precise way, based on domain ontologies. It emerged that CoGui could be very useful in acquiring information that can be used in collaboration with others to continuously improve information sharing and re-use. A French AEC company located in the Southwest region was employed as a case study in illustrating knowledge modeling through the experience feedback process.

Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The building and construction domain is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information between actors. For example, semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, are problems fundamentally created through the employment of representations to map the ‘world’ into models in an endeavour to anticipate different actors’ views, vocabulary, and objectives. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work is the process of formalization and representation of document content, where most existing approaches are limited in their capability and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched by incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (the Semantic Associations) modelled by domain ontologies combined with the information presented in documents, thereby providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework for representation of knowledge sources, where each knowledge source is semantically represented (within its domain of use) by a Semantic Vector. This work contributes to the enrichment of Semantic Vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support, employing ontology concepts and their relations in the enrichment process. The test bed for the assessment of the approach is the Building and Construction industry, using an appropriateB&CdomainOntology. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications.

For these standards to be effective, they must be clearly defined and easily extensible, encourage consistency in their usage, and integrate cleanly with existing industrial standards, such as BACnet. There is a natural tension between informal tag-based systems that rely upon idiom and convention for meaning, and formal ontologies amenable to automated tooling. We present a qualitative analysis of Project Haystack, a popular tagging system for building metadata, and identify a family of inherent interpretability and consistency issues in the tagging model that stem from its lack of a formal definition. To address these issues, we present the design and implementation of the Brick+ ontology, a drop-in replacement for Brick with clear formal semantics that enables the inference of a valid Brick model from an informal Haystack model, and demonstrate this inference across five Haystack models. © Copyright © 2020 Fierro, Koh, Nagare, Zang, Agarwal, Gupta and Culler.",Brick; building management; metadata; ontologies; OWL; Project Haystack; RDF; smart buildings,,Article,,3.0,"Look at BACnet, BRICK and BRICK+.

This causes global warming and waste problems. The demand for the reuse of construction materials is increasing, although it is not the convention, to reduce the environmental impact. Although the sustainable effect of the reuse of materials has been proven in several studies, materials are not always reused in practice, owing to the lack of an information system for reusable materials and the economic uncertainty. In this study, we propose a framework for designing structures using reusable steel beams. The design framework consists of a material bank and a design support tool. The material bank provides information on reusable materials based on the building information modeling. The design support tool generates efficient material procurement plans and provides information about the environmental and economic impact of the project. In a case study used to verify the framework, CO2 emissions were reduced by up to 77% through material reuse, which was consistent with the results of previous studies. However, owing to the cost of processing reusable materials, the overall cost was found to increase by up to about 40%. Therefore, an economic analysis over the entire life cycle when using reusable materials needs to be done. © 2020 by the authors.

Currently existing data exchange problems between different software applications is adversely impacting the overall productivity of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. The use of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) has been proposed to help address the lack of interoperability throughout construction industry. But the IFC specification itself is too complicated for normal users without special training. This paper proposes a semantic Web Services framework utilizing IFC-based industry ontology to address the interoperability problem. First, the possibility of building an IFC-based construction industry ontology is reviewed. Then, a framework to build semantic Web Services on this ontology is suggested. Both a core service and an assistant service is included. The framework could be easily expanded as long as the same Web Services model and the common ontology is observed. Once implemented, the framework could be utilized by any IFC-supported BIM applications, as well as personnel without extensive knowledge of IFC specifications, for more precise, consistent and up-to-date project information retrieval. This approach is expected to further the effort of IFC and enhance and improve interoperability in the AEC industry without requiring extremely technologically savvy users. © 2011 ASCE.",Construction industry; Information management; Internet,"AEC industry; Architecture , engineering and construction industries; Construction projects; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Multi-disciplinary teams; Software applications; Architectural design; Civil engineering; Construction industry; Electronic data interchange; Information management; Information retrieval; Internet; Interoperability; Ontology; Semantic Web; Specifications; Web services",Conference Paper,,3.0,Interoperability of IFC-ontology.

The standards have similar objectives but show fundamental differences in semantics and structure. This work compares the standards and points out similarities and differences, firstly in order to understand their structure, and secondly to initiate a discussion about the need and the possibility to coordinate them. An integration of IFC with ISO 12006-2 would facilitate and speed up the application in everyday practise of object-based information management.

Architecture, engineering, and construction industry spends time and money to solve the information sharing and interoperability issues between different domains. With the advent of building information modeling, a 3D CAD model of a project is used as a shared knowledge resource during the design, construction, and facility management phases of a project's life cycle. Currently, 4D models are created by combining CAD and schedule information. A 4D model is useful for detecting potential construction conflicts during the project planning and design and a valuable tool during construction. However, creating 4D models requires a great amount of human involvement. An approach that facilitates integrating BIM and schedule information can improve efficiency and is highly desirable. This paper presents a new approach to information modeling using the Semantic Web technology. The Semantic Web provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that allows computers to access and combine information distributed over the Internet. The paper discusses: (1) ontologies that the authors have developed for BIM and project schedule information; (2) how ontologies are used for creating project knowledge bases in RDF/OWL format; and (3) how project knowledge bases can facilitate machine processing of project information and semantic interoperability among project knowledge bases. The Semantic Web approach allows information to be saved once at the provider source and be used by authorized users as needed. This means BIM information is created and maintained by designers and project schedule is created and maintained by schedulers on their respective servers. This would allow the latest BIM and project schedule information to be accessed over the Internet and combined for various purposes. © ASCE.",,"Architectural design; Budget control; Computer aided design; Construction industry; Information analysis; Information management; Information theory; Information use; Internet; Interoperability; Life cycle; Office buildings; Semantic Web; Architecture , engineering , and constructions; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction projects; Information Modeling; Project informations; Semantic interoperability; Semantic web approach; Semantic Web technology; Project management",Conference Paper,,3.0,Look at point (2) how ontologies are used for creating project knowledge bases in RDF/OWL format,

This study performs knowledge discovery of construction products from domain experts to build an ontology. However, ontology developed becomes an isolated conceptualization. In order to get rich domain ontology, novel approach is to retrieve knowledge from domain-specific online product repositories such as the industry foundation classes. This study identifies similarities between the industry foundation classes and ontology likewise their differences with the hope that it would develop an enhanced knowledge conceptualization of the domain. Integration of IFC and ontology will mean that concepts represent well-established standard terms rich in domain knowledge. Other semantic web technologies can then be exploited on the resulting application to perform data querying, consistency checking, data reasoning, knowledge inference and so much more.

Continuous strain data was collected during the entire erecting process of the new building using a wireless sensor network to obtain novel information on construction-induced stresses. The collected data will be used to assess the magnitude of construction induced stresses.

Still in its infancy, this circular economy strategy disrupts structural design practice in many ways: Rather than manufacturing components after the design of a system, the system is synthesised from a given stock of reclaimed components; versatility, reversibility and transformability become hard requirements for all loadbearing systems and components; costs, performance and environmental assessments span multiple service lifecycles.

The collaboration requires the iterative and coordinated exchange of information for significant improvement of the building design, construction and management. The successful representation of these information refinements enables the identification of the required level of detail (LOD) for data sharing parameters between the multiple disciplines. Since the last decade, LOD is a promising approach for efficient representation of semantically rich BIM data in different levels. Despite the improvement, there is a lack of efficient implementation in building lifecycle functionalities, because of their fundamental heterogeneity, versatility and adaptability. The proposed approach enables the representation of LOD-sensitive BIM data through the formal definition of ontologies. The paper validates this approach based on the concept of competency questions and their respective SPARQL queries. With the demonstration and validation, the paper provides the conceptual proof for the practical application of the developed approach.

The enmeshment of the Web and various business processes has made it imperative to define business information in a format that facilitates machine-to-machine exchange and automated processing. The construction industry is not an exception; construction business processes depend on a diverse set of information sources. For efficient processing of the construction business information, it is necessary to publish the information in a format that allows computer applications to easily discover, query and share the information. Currently, the standard for representing, accessing, and sharing a building model is the Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) data model. Several researchers have investigated the limitations of IFCs data model for interoperability among heterogeneous software applications. This paper presents the results of an on-going research on an ontology-based approach to building information modeling to facilitate information exchange among different knowledge domain applications. The approach developed in this study is based on a shared building ontology that models building domain element types and element relationships. The information systems to be integrated should be modeled using the shared ontology; each knowledge domain adds its own element properties to the shared building ontology.

Knowledge is used as an important resource in many industrial areas, and so it follows that there is a growing interest in knowledge management within the construction industry. Yet because of the unique characteristics of construction knowledge created during projects, there are limitations to its capture and reuse. The knowledge produced during construction projects is project-oriented, experiential, and context specific; due to these characteristics, the reuse of knowledge is difficult. In this research, research team focus on capturing and identifying the characteristics of construction knowledge, then propose a method for applying these characteristics to the development of an ontology-based construction knowledge retrieval system. Moreover, research team developed a system prototype that applies ontology in suggesting related search words during the search process and validated the effectiveness of the prototype in terms of precision and recall rate.

With more information being added to the model, the size of the model file and the difficulty to manipulate the model increase. However, different use scenarios may only require access to certain specific information stored in the model. In contrast with the ample research of ontology applications in construction knowledge management, research of ontology in construction modeling has been limited. Hence, the purpose of this study is to use ontology in the extraction of a partial building information model from the original complete model. The building information models covered in this study are in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format, which is a widely supported open BIM standard. An ontology TBox is developed according to the existing IFC schema specifications. For each specific IFC model, an ontology ABox is generated at run time, combining the ontology TBox and the IFC instances in the model. The ABox works as an index in the partial model extraction algorithm. A prototype Java program based on the algorithm was developed to demonstrate and validate the algorithm using both a sample model and an IFC model from a real building. The results indicated that the use of ontology provides a valid way to deal with the technical complexity of IFC models. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Building information modeling (BIM); Extraction algorithm; Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Ontology; Partial model,Building Information Model - BIM; Construction knowledge managements; Extraction algorithms; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Ontology applications; Partial modeling; Specific information; Technical complexity; Algorithms; Buildings; Computer software; Construction industry; Extraction; Java programming language; Knowledge management; Ontology; Architectural design,Conference Paper,,1.0,Difference between ontology for construction knowledge management and ontology for construction modeling.

The multistakeholder context of the construction industry creates problems such as poor information interoperability and low productivity arising from difficulties in information reuse. Many researchers have explored the use of ontology to address these issues. This study aims to review ontology research to explore its trends, gaps, and opportunities in the construction industry. A systematic process employing three-phase search method, objective analysis and subjective analysis, helps to provide enough potential articles related to construction ontology research, and to reduce arbitrariness and subjectivity involved in research topic analysis. As a result, three main research topics aligned with the ontology development lifecycle were derived as follows: information integration based on ontology, ontology building, and ontology application. In addition, research gaps and the corresponding research agenda were identified. This detailed review provides the basis for further studies on the use of ontology in the construction industry.

Besides, construction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. According to the waste hierarchies, reuse is preferred to recycling; however, most of the recovery of construction and demolition wastes happens in the form of recycling and not reuse. Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts’ opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study. Furthermore, the results of the survey are used to develop an easy-to-understand learner for assessing the technical reusability of the structural elements at the end-of-life of a building.

Making these big data available at high performance rates and speeds and into the correct (intuitive) formats is therefore an incredibly high challenge in this domain. Yet, hardly any benchmark is available for this industry that (1) gives an overview of the kind of data typically handled in this domain; and (2) that lists the query and reasoning performance results in handling these data. In this article, we therefore present a set of available sample data that explicates the scale of the situation, and we additionally perform a query and reasoning performance benchmark. This results not only in an initial set of quantitative performance results, but also in recommendations in implementing a web-based system relying heavily on large semantic data.

However, this interest remains largely academic and has not sparked much adoption of web technologies in the field. To nourish adoption of Linked Data in practice, access to the data has to be made more easy. SPARQL, the recommended RDF query language, has proven very powerful for retrieving and updating RDF datasets. However, due to its verbosity and complexity, it is often considered a threshold for developers to implement in their tools. In this paper, we compare SPARQL with Linked Data querying languages that extend the GraphQL syntax, in context of querying building datasets: HyperGraphQL and GraphQL-LD. Since it went open source in 2015, GraphQL has been adopted by a large community of developers, partly due to its elegance and conciseness. As a use case, the queries are performed on an RDF-based multi-model that relies on the recent ISO standard ICDD (ISO 21597). ICDD interlinks information on a sub-document identifier level, based on OWL. It is aimed at the industry in that it adds a layer of Linked Data to documentation formats that are still widely used in practice: IFC, spreadsheets, imagery etc. Therefore, it is considered a tuned use case for comparing these different RDF query languages. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

To reach this goal, it is necessary to use open standards for model exchange such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The non-profit organization buildingSMART defines this standard. IFC provides object types and attributes, which describe properties of objects. The IFC standard do not address possible values for attributes; but beside coordinated names for object types and attributes, coordinated values for attributes are required. This is necessary for the evaluation of digital models for different purposes. Several approaches in the fields of ontology and classification systems address this issue. However, at present time there is no clear distinction between prerequisites that modeled objects have to fulfill and products, which satisfy these requirements. Suppliers or construction companies at the interface between planning and construction propose products for the modelled requirements of the planning process. This paper describes an approach that bases on a dictionary, which provides standardized object types, attributes and values. A project database and a database with products, called supplier database, use this dictionary as a basis. Resulting from the modeling phase, the project database is ultimately mapped with the supplier database to propose products that fulfill the requirements.

The resulting list is classified according to pre-established parameters, thus presenting which are the potentially best alternatives to close the material loops and recover chemical resources. The proposed method is tested through the generation and evaluation of different routes for the treatment of plastic waste materials, with a special focus on chemical recycling. © 2021",Chemical recycling; Circular economy; Material upcycling; Ontologies; Plastic waste treatment; Waste-to-resource,Knowledge management; Ontology; Plastic recycling; Assessment procedure; Chemical recycling; Circular economy; ITS applications; Knowledge management tool; Material upcycling; Ontology's; Plastic waste treatment; Potential wastes; Waste-to-resource; Waste treatment,Article,,2.0,To make case about Ontologie for Inventories for Reuse-Purposes and in Circular Economy,

As a result, one physical object yields several disciplinary representations, allowing designers to describe design options discipline-specifically and thus explore design differently. In a co-design approach, data from disciplines must be integrated and interoperable. But in current practice, interoperability problems between different software often hinders data integration. This paper presents a review and evaluation of interoperability paradigms in centralized, decentralized, and federated data, and it gives AEC application examples for each approach. It discusses data schemas (e.g. IFC) and interoperability tools (e.g. Speckle, BHoM). It also relates the interoperability tools to semantic web standards that are used to share information. It argues the advantages of federated data interoperability and suggests using design tools that employ such a mechanism. Furthermore, this paper suggests developing modular disciplinary ontologies to support collaborative design tools. Such federated interoperability, supported by modular disciplinary ontologies, can provide a solid ground to share and exchange data flexibly. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",alignment; Building Information Modelling (BIM); Co-Design; Data mapping; Interoperability; Knowledge representation; Ontologies,Architectural design; Construction industry; Data integration; Interoperability; Ontology; AEC industry; Building industry; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Co-designs; Data interoperability; Data mappings; Knowledge-representation; Modulars; Ontology's; Knowledge representation,Conference Paper,,2.0,Look at interoperability - definition and how it is seen in this paper,

The UK government has long recognised this and is taking the lead towards a more sustainable approach to construction processes. Success towards a more sustainable construction can be achieved if the stakeholders are informed of the new technologies, innovations and knowledge emerging in the sector. Unfortunately, researchers and practitioners have pin-pointed some limitations with the current approaches in the management of knowledge within the construction sector. Interestingly, Semantic Web technologies, the next generation of the Web technologies, can be used to overcome these limitations. Semantic web technologies can considerably improve information representation, sharing and re-use. This paper investigates the extent to which Semantic Web technologies could be used in representing knowledge on emerging sustainable building technologies. This is done by reviewing the current state-of-the art of sustainable technologies in the UK construction industry. Furthermore, it examines the development of an ontology-driven knowledge base and its usage in the development of a semantic web application.",Ontology-driven knowledge base; Semantic web technology; Sustainability development,Construction process; Construction sectors; Information representation; Knowledge base; Quality of life; Semantic web applications; Semantic Web technology; State of the art; Sustainable building; Sustainable construction; Sustainable technology; UK construction industry; Web technologies; Construction industry; Intelligent buildings; Knowledge based systems; Project management; Research; Sustainable development; Technology,Conference Paper,,2.0,Look at definition of semanitc web technologies and what they are ,

In comparison to green-field construction projects, adaptive reuse projects require distinct stages, definition of interfaces, decision gates, and planning methods in order to secure the success of the building project. Unfortunately, little research has been done regarding establishing feasible systems for the planning, assessment, and management of adaptive reuse projects, leading to underperforming building projects outcomes. Interface management (IM) can improve renovation projects outcomes by defining appropriate ways to identify, record, monitor, and track project interfaces. IM has the potential of bringing cost and time benefits during adaptive reuse projects execution. The aim of this study is to develop a reference framework for implementing IM for adaptive reuse projects. First, the inefficiencies of redevelopment projects are explained inside of a circular economy (CE) context. Second, an ontology of IM for adaptive reuse projects is defined based on the current barriers to adaptive reuse and the most common interface problems in construction projects. Third, the defined ontology is expanded through a case study by showing examples of adaptive reuse barriers on a case project, and how IM could have been part of the solution for these problems. Finally, this study concludes with the suggestions on interface management systems (IMS) implementation for future adaptive reuse projects. © 2019 by the authors.",Adaptive reuse of buildings; Barriers in adaptive reuse projects; Circular economy; Interface management system; Interface problems in construction projects,,Article,,1.0,IMPORTANT - Paper about Ontology for adaptive reuse.
