In this paper, the mechanical, electrically conductive, and self-sensing performances of SSWs reinforced UHPC were investigated. The modification mechanisms of SSWs to UHPC were revealed by microstructure, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and intrinsically electrical conductivity analysis. The results show that the 1.5 vol. % of SSWs can increase the flexural strength, flexural toughness of UHPC unnotched beams and equivalent flexural strength of UHPC notched beams by 103.2%, 146.5% and 80.0% respectively. Meanwhile, the dynamic impact toughness and dissipate energy of SSWs reinforced UHPC with the strain rate ranging from 94 /s to 926 /s are increased by 43.5% and 58.2%, respectively. The electrical resistivity is reduced by six orders of magnitudes and the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy only shows small flat arcs in the first quadrant in UHPC containing 0.5 vol.% of SSWs in diameter of 20 μm. The gauge factor of UHPC reinforced with SSWs in diameter of 8 μm can reach up to 22.5, 94.9 and 43.6 under cyclic compression, monotonic compression and flexure, respectively. The microstructure analysis indicates that the modification effect of SSWs on UHPC results from the extensive network of SSWs in UHPC, the inhibition on micro-cracks propagation and the pull-out and stripping of SSWs under loading. SSWs reinforced UHPC has great potential for developing pre-cast structural elements or cast-in-place joints for prefabricated structures, which will achieve the monitoring for structural key positions and can be efficiently used for health monitoring and safety assessment of prefabricated structures driven by the sensing information of multifunctional concrete. This will further avoid the issue concerning high cost of large scale application of multifunctional concrete. In addition, the smart pre-cast structural elements can be reusable and replaceable. Therefore, developing SSWs reinforced UHPC for prefabricated structures can make infrastructures safer, more durable and sustainable. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Multifunction; Prefabricated structures; Smart; Super-fine stainless wire; UHPC","Aspect ratio; Bending strength; Computer software reusability; Concrete buildings; Durability; Electric conductivity; Electric impedance; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; High performance concrete; Microstructure; Reinforcement; Software testing; Spectrum analysis; Strain rate; Strengthening (metal); Electrochemical-impedance spectroscopies; Electromagnetic characteristic; Mechanical; Multi-functions; Pre-cast; Prefabricated structures; Smart; Structural elements; Super-fine stainless wire; Thermal; Wire",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134358615

With building codes relaxing height limitations, there is a need for novel connection solutions for the next generation of tall timber buildings. There is also a need to ensure that mass timber products are being used responsibly and sustainably, with deconstruction and reuse being identified as important factors in this pursuit. This paper presents and discusses a new hybrid shear connection for mass timber buildings that allows for easy construction, deconstruction, and reuse of the structural elements. The connection consists of a fully threaded steel rod embedded into a CLT panel and reinforced with a layer of epoxy-based grout. The structural performance of shear connections with varying rod diameter and steel strength-grade, grout thickness, and CLT grade is analyzed. An insight into the behaviour under quasi-static monotonic incremental loads is given based on a comprehensive experimental campaign, with a total of 84 push-out tests performed on squared CLT specimens. Experiments show that strong and stiff behaviour can be achieved and that the yield point is clearly identifiable, supporting optimum capacity design strategies. This allows for the connection to be protected from damage and therefore reusable. Observed failure modes suggest that load-carrying capacity and stiffness models, as per common wood bolted connections, can be developed. This high-performance shear connection has great potential for deconstruction and reuse and supports prefabricated hybrid CLT-based structural solutions for large-scale building construction. © 2023, Canadian Society for Civil Engineering.",,"Building codes; Concrete construction; Grouting; Mortar; Reinforcement; Structural analysis; Wooden buildings; Epoxy-based; Performance; Reuse; Shear connections; Steel rod; Steel strength; Structural elements; Structural performance; Timber buildings; Timber products; Timber",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133213438

Once the model is established, further benefits can be reaped, such as the analysis of complex technical correlations within the system. Various insights can be gained by displaying the model as a formal graph and querying it. To enable such queries, a graph schema is necessary, which allows to transfer the model into a graph database. In the course of this paper, we discuss the design of a graph schema and MBSE modeling approach, enabling deep going system analysis and anomaly resolution in complex embedded systems with a focus on testing and anomaly resolution. The schema and modeling approach are designed to answer questions such as What happens if there is an electrical short in a component? Which other components are now offline and which data cannot be gathered anymore? If a component becomes unresponsive, which alternative routes can be established to obtain data processed by it. We build on the use case of qualification and operations of a small spacecraft. Structural elements of the MBSE model are transferred to a graph database where analyses are conducted on the system. The schema is implemented by means of an adapter for MagicDraw to Neo4J. A selection of complex analyses is shown in the example of the MOVE-II space mission. ©","Anomaly resolution; graph databases; MBSE; SysML; SysML graph schema","Curricula; Embedded systems; Query languages; Query processing; Reusability; Systems analysis; Systems engineering; Anomaly resolution; Data engineering; Graph data; Graph database; Model-based system engineerings; Modeling approach; SysML; SysML graph schema; Systems engineering data; Systems engineering model; Graph Databases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85142134296

To facilitate deconstruction and efficient reuse of steel components, an innovative connection system was proposed. This system adopts a ‘Block Shear Connector (BSC)’ that allows beam length to be standardised and suitable for a wide range of different sizes of the supporting members within the same planning grid. This paper presents the experimental and numerical studies of a beam-to-beam connection using BSCs. The BSC used was made from a standard universal HE / UC section and was bolted to the beams by using partial depth end plates. The experimental results provided the shear resistance, moment-rotation, failure behaviour, demountability and reusability of the steel components. Further numerical simulation conducted investigated the effect of some key parameters (steel strength, thickness of BSC web, thickness of BSC flange, initial bolt stress) on the behaviour of the connections. The results obtained highlighted the demountability of this innovative bolted connection system and the reusability of structural components. © 2022 The Authors","Block shear connector; Demountable; Experimental study; Finite element modelling; Standardisation; Steel reuse","Bolts; Finite element method; Numerical models; Standardization; Block shear; Block shear connector; Demountable; Element models; Experimental study; Finite element modeling; Reuse; Shear connector; Steel components; Steel reuse; Reusability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137171907

A series of coupon tests under typical earthquake-induced loading rates are carried out. In addition to the conventional monotonic tension test, the specimens are also tested under a discontinuous loading protocol that is analogous to the ramp-and-hold scheme employed in the pseudo-dynamic hybrid simulations. The test results are used to develop a uniaxial steel material model to account for the strain rate effect and stress relaxation. The material model facilitates the reuse of existing steel hysteresis models and can be used to model different structural components, such as columns, beams, braces, etc. The material model is then used for a parametric study to evaluate the impact of various loading rates on the global seismic response of a single degree of freedom structural system with different structural periods, and types and intensities of ground motions. It is found that the impact of loading rates is more significant for structures with a period of 0.5 s or less and it thus requires a fast control of the physical specimen in pseudo-dynamic hybrid testing. In addition, the material model is applied to a five-storey buckling restrained braced frame (BRBF) building with a structural period of 1.2 s. It is found that the earthquake-induced loading rates have a minor impact on the global response of the structure. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","loading rate; pseudo-dynamic simulation; seismic analysis; steel material; strain rate effect; stress relaxation","Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Earthquakes; Hysteresis; Steel structures; Strain rate; Stress relaxation; Structural frames; Tensile testing; Coupon tests; Dynamics simulation; Hybrid simulation; Loading rate; Material modeling; Pseudo-dynamic simulation; Pseudo-dynamics; Seismic analysis; Steel materials; Strain rate effect; Seismic response; computer simulation; dynamic response; loading test; seismic response; steel structure; strain rate; structural response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132025640

Their wide application has a direct impact on the amount of post-production and post-consumer waste. The global problem with recycling, especially of fiber-reinforced polymeric materials, has prompted research into methods of their use. Previous research on composite materials with polyester–glass recyclate showed a decrease in mechanical properties. The construction material should have the highest mechanical properties. Based on the literature, it was found that the use of nanoadditives may have a positive effect on the parameters of the materials. The use of gamma aluminum nanopowder, in a small amount can significantly increase the mechanical properties of composites with polyester–glass recyclate, and thus can affect the application of these materials to structural elements. The article is devoted to the research on the hardness of composite materials with polyester–glass recyclate and gamma aluminum nanopowder. The main goal is to investigate the possibility of using a nanoadditive as a material, increasing the mechanical properties of composites with polyester–glass recyclate, so as to create a recycled material with the highest possible strength parameters. Hardness tests were performed using the Barcol method. For each composite material, 30 measurements were made in order to subject the results to a statistical analysis. Using parametric statistical tests it was shown that the obtained hardness values at the assumed level of statistical significance pv = 0.05 for comparisons for the samples of the reference material (B0) do not differ by chance, while for the comparisons in the configurations of the reference material (B0) with the modified materials, (R10, A2, R10A2) they do not differ by accident. Studies have shown that the addition of 2% gamma aluminum nanopowder slightly lowers the hardness of a pure polyester–glass composite, but the same additive allows the hardness of composite materials to be increased with the addition of glass recyclate. This is of particular importance for the development of the optimal composition of polyester–glass composites with the addition of recyclate, which will have good strength properties and at the same time enable the reuse of composite waste. © 2022 by the authors.","hardness; nanoadditives; nanocomposites; recycling; statistical analysis","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Fiber reinforced plastics; Glass; Hardness; Nanostructured materials; Statistics; Aluminum nanopowders; Composites material; Gamma aluminum; Glass composites; Nano powders; Nanoadditives; Polymer composite; Properties of composites; Recyclates; Reference material; Recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137921118

However, there is still a lack of quantitative studies on the corresponding environmental benefits in this regard. In the present study, a life cycle assessment of a multi-storey residential reference building is carried out, comparing a flexible, reversible building design using a load-bearing steel structure and wooden ceiling elements to a conventional, monolithic design based on reinforced concrete. The assessment is carried out on a whole building level, including construction, operation, maintenance, and the end-of-life phase. Both building designs show similar results for a regular life cycle of 60 years without major refurbishment (13 and 14.5 kg CO2-eq/m2 per operational year). When longer building lifetimes are considered, the environmental impact of the reference building per operational year decreases significantly. In this context, flexible building design is advantageous as it facilitates the refurbishment of buildings, while monolithic building design often leads to premature demolition due to low adaptability. Further advantages of reversible building design include the increased potential of materials to be recirculated at the end-of-life stage of a building and in the potential reuse of structural elements. This study shows that 14% of the embodied greenhouse gas emissions of the flexible building can be avoided if the foundation, load-bearing structure and ceiling elements are kept in place for a subsequent building. Such direct reuse leads to a substantially higher environmental value retention than recycling of the same materials. © 2022 The Authors","Circular economy; Comparative LCA; Construction sector; Flexible building design; WBLCA; Whole building LCA","Architectural design; Construction industry; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Reinforced concrete; Sustainable development; Building design; Circular economy; Comparative LCA; Construction sectors; End of lives; Flexible building; Flexible building design; Monolithics; WBLCA; Whole building LCA; Life cycle; architectural design; comparative study; construction industry; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; reinforced concrete; steel structure; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85135388116

Reuse of structural elements made of concrete is of particular interest, given the large use of this material worldwide and its high environmental impact. Reusing constructive concrete elements is however challenging, particularly because connections between concrete structural elements are difficult to disassemble. It is then worth designing reuse techniques for concrete load-bearing elements and to verify their environmental performance using comprehensive methods such as Life Cycle Assessment. Based on the Design for Reuse concept, this article assesses the environmental impacts of a reusable structural portal frame constitutive of a concrete building and compares it to a traditional design with new materials. It relies on data collected through an experimental protocol of reinforced concrete structures construction/deconstruction/reconstruction using hydrodemolition. Impact scores are significantly reduced for all environmental categories after a first reuse cycle, both at the scale of a portal frame or a building. Concrete, and particularly high performance concrete, has durability qualities allowing to undergo several usage cycles. The effectiveness of environmental benefits however depends on functional downgrading and material losses. Guidance should then be provided to insure that future reuse practices will actually provide the expected benefits. This has to be conducted in parallel to full-scale experiments of load-bearing elements disassembly to estimate the realistic rates that can be obtained when deconstructing a building. © 2022","Buildings; Circular economy; Concrete structures; Deconstruction; Design for reuse; Life cycle assessment","Architectural design; Carbon footprint; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Construction industry; Ecodesign; Emission control; Environmental management; High performance concrete; Reinforced concrete; Buildings sector; Circular economy; Construction sectors; Deconstruction; Design for reuse; Load-bearing elements; Portal frame; Reuse; Reuse practices; Structural elements; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126916036

This paper addresses this technical challenge. It presents the results of a feasibility study using a variety of potential techniques, including laser cutting, band-saw cutting, wire-saw and wall-saw cutting, and diamond core drilling, to cut welded shear connectors in conventional steel-concrete composite beams with the steel sheeting perpendicular to the steel section. The most feasible reclaiming method was found to be wire-saw and wall-saw cutting. After reclaiming steel sections, steel tensile coupon tests were carried out on the recovered steel sections and their mechanical properties were compared to those of the original steel used in the composite beams. The coupon test results showed identical behaviour of the original and reclaimed steels. The energy use of the different methods of reclaiming was also recorded to calculate carbon emission and was found to be several orders of magnitude lower than manufacturing virgin steel or recycling steel. © 2022","Circular economy; Composite beam; Cutting; End of service life; Reclaiming; Reuse; Welded steel stud","Composite beams and girders; Recycling; Sawing; Timber; Welding; Circular economy; Composite beam; End of service life; Reclaiming; Reuse; Saw cutting; Steel sections; Steel studs; Welded steel stud; Welded steels; Concrete slabs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85129534698

Also, these PDMS microdevices are mostly limited to single use, and it is difficult to recover the contents inside the microchannels or perform advanced microscopy visualization due to their irreversible sealing method. Herein, we developed a novel manufacturing method based on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) plates adjusted using a mechanical pressure‐based system. One conformation of the PMMA plate assembly system allows the reproducible manufacture of PDMS replicas, reducing the cost since a precise amount of PDMS is used, and the PDMS replicas show uniform dimensions. A second form of assembling the PMMA plates permits pressure‐based sealing of the PDMS layer with a glass base. By reversibly sealing the microdevice without using plasma for bonding, we achieve chip on/off configurations, which allow the user to open and close the device and reuse it in an easy‐to‐use way. No deformation was observed on the structures of the PDMS microchannels when a range of 10 to 18 kPa pressure was applied using the technique. Furthermore, the functionality of the proposed system was successfully validated by the generation of microdroplets with reused microdevices via three repetitions. © 2022 by the authors.

It is partially installed by self-weight followed by insertion to the final depth by applying suction. During suction penetration, the soil accommodated by skirt wall will move into the caisson inside, leading to soil plug heave that prevents the caisson from penetrating to the desired depth. To mitigate the effect of the soil plug heave, suction caissons are fabricated with external bevels, so as to force the more expelled soil to the outside of the caisson. This paper presents failure mechanisms for calculating the penetration resistance to skirt-tip with various external bevels under two limit conditions. For the smooth base, the failure mechanism consists of two active shear zones below the smooth base and two radial and passive shear zones that are identical to those of a deep foundation. For the rough base, two active shear zones formed below the smooth base are replaced by the radial shear zones. According to the slip-line theory, the penetration resistance of skirt-tip with various external bevels is deduced in terms of su and weighted average of σi and σo (where su is undrained shear strength, σi and σo are equivalent overburdens inside and outside the caisson at the skirt-tip level). Theoretical result shows that the resistance factor Nc of skirt-tip increases with increasing αi and αo and decreasing δ (where αi and αo are adhesion factors, and δ is the angle of external bevel from the horizontal). The difference of resistance factor Nc between rough and smooth bases identically equals 0.57. Finally, numerical simulations borrowed from the literature are used to testify the rationality of the analytical solution presented in this study. © 2022","Clay; External bevel; Skirt-tip resistance; Slip-line method; Suction caissons","Caissons; Failure (mechanical); Foundations; Offshore oil well production; Pressure vessels; External bevel; Failure mechanism; Penetration resistances; Shear zone; Skirt-tip resistance; Slip line method; Smooth basis; Soil plugs; Suction caisson; Tip resistance; Soils; caisson; clay; failure mechanism; foundation; offshore structure; penetration; shear zone; structural component; suction; wind turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85125459833

By contrasting their building-specific features, it demonstrates the benefits and drawbacks of particular structural elements and envelope solutions and ecological aspects using various system boundaries of life-cycle assessment (LCA). Following a careful consideration of ecological factors and sustainable circular economy criteria, a structural component that is sustainably optimized is defined. This component should be chosen based on external conditions. By selecting environmentally friendly building materials and proper connecting procedures that enable separability, resource-efficient and sustainable buildings can be achieved. Both the selection of load-bearing elements and the necessary insulating material have a significant impact on the ecological performance and reusability options of the components. The elements of homogeneity, separability, and pollutantfreeness play a significant influence in the reuse process, namely in terms of details and construction type in general, as well as the ways of reusing and recycling them. Sustainable solutions for load-bearing building components can be created by simultaneously investigating environmentally friendly building materials and the structure of the components. This paper illustrates how the natural resources can be used both optimally and sustainably. It presents a conceptual framework for scenario development of the LCA of load-bearing structures, their effect on the design and decision-making process. There is a potential of increasing total resource efficiency at the building level with a suitable combination of the material components employed at the component level. Because of this, the overall energy efficiency and its consequent ecological impacts are the main topics of this study. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Implementation of these techniques cannot be completed without considering the negative effect of construction in the environment and the urgent need for environmental impact reduction through reusability and recyclability. This paper deepens into this direction by presenting a form-finding/automated fabrication approach of shell forms in combination with a recycle material implementation. The process starts by examining form-finding possibilities of funicular forms by producing a series of case studies based on a number of controlled parameters, physical attributes and static performance criteria. Then, an alternative use of construction materials is presented, in order to achieve sustainable properties, and adequate static performance of both, the overall structure and the individual structural components. In order to achieve this, cylindrical samples of different recycle material combinations are produced, tested under compression and their implementation is discussed. The suggested integrated form-finding to automated fabrication approach offers the opportunity for a holistic sustainable approach towards shell structures development, aiming at shape and performance viability through the selection of recycle materials. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Model-driven engineering (MDE) provides tools, modelling notations and practices suited for engineering such DSLs, both from a syntactic and semantic perspective. However, low-code software development is heavily reliant on software reuse. It is imperative to provide safe mechanisms that guarantee valid semantic reuse of structural components and their behaviour, most often in a stepwise manner. This article presents a semantic reuse technique based on model subtyping over metamodels to manage correct model-driven engineering of DSLs. Model subtyping is generalized to structural semantics by considering OCL constraints. Moreover, model subtyping is generalized to behavioural semantics by considering specifications of model transformation operations, which may encode operational or translational semantics. Model subtyping facilitates structural and behavioural refinement. It has been implemented atop a bounded model checker, realizing a semi-decidable procedure for verifying that DSL elements are safely reused. The algorithm finds semantic witnesses of inconsistencies when refinement principles are not satisfied, fostering a correct stepwise engineering of DSLs. Moreover, the algorithm produces an extension metamodel that permits the as-is reuse of implementations of model transformation operation specifications. Finally, the versatility of the model subtyping technique is illustrated with common use cases extracted from the research literature. © 2022, The Author(s).","DSL engineering; Model subtyping; Software specification; Stepwise refinement","Application programs; Computer software reusability; Digital subscriber lines; Formal languages; Model checking; Problem oriented languages; Semantics; Software design; Specifications; Domain-specific language engineering; Domains specific languages; Language engineering; Meta model; Model subtyping; Model-driven Engineering; Reuse; Software Specification; Stepwise refinement; Subtypings; Modeling languages",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137478332

To satisfy the first perspective, composites materials are being increasingly used to produce lightweight structural and semi-structural components. However, the automotive mass production arises the problem of the end-of-life disposal of the vehicle and the reduction of the wastes environmental impact. The circular economy of the composite materials has therefore become a challenge of primary importance for car manufacturers and tier 1 suppliers. It is necessary to pursue a different economic model, combining traditional raw materials with the intensive use of materials from recycling processes. New technologies are being studied and developed concerning the reuse of in-line production scraps with out-of-autoclave process that makes them desirable for high production rate applications. In this frame, a methodology for the reuse of prepreg cutouts coming from in-line ply cutting process is proposed. Production cutouts (scraps, or chops) are used as a charge to manufacture components through the compression molding process. The structure of the final part keeps in meso-scale the same orthotropic orientation of the chops, although it is quasi-isotropic from a macroscopic point of view. Accordingly, standard three-point bending, and tensile mechanical tests were performed to characterize the mechanical behavior of the material. Failure modes and fracture propagation were analyzed too. The chop interface resulted to affect the mechanical performance. Before material failure, multiple damage precursor sites nucleated, generally in correspondence of the chop interfaces. Delamination, brittle fracture of the matrix and debonding between the chops were the main failure modes. The results of the standard coupon tests evidenced good performance of the material in terms of strength and stiffness, despite lower than standard 2x2 twill structure, making the studied material suitable for semi-structural purposes. Accordingly, a prototype of an accelerator pedal frame was produced, in order to evaluate the feasibility, the potential limitations and the aspects to be optimized for the manufacturing of a more complex component. ©",,"Automotive industry; Bending tests; Compression molding; Emission control; Waste disposal; Automotive sector; Automotives; Circular economy; Composites material; Emission reduction; End of lives; Lightweight components; Mass production; Reuse; Structural component; Interfaces (materials)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85137152123

During the production process, wet blue leather shavings are produced, and this material is classified as hazardous solid waste. Given the global concern about chromium pollution and considering the potential for waste reuse in the construction industry, this article aimed to evaluate a new and more sustainable material for civil construction. Leather shavings were solidified/stabilized in polypropylene using an extrusion process to obtain recycled lightweight aggregates as an alternative to natural sand. This is the first study of leather shavings' solidification/stabilization in a polypropylene matrix. The new material has been tested replacing 25%, 50%, and 75% of the sand by volume. Results showed that the novel process of wet blue leather shavings treatment to produce cement matrices was efficient for the proper disposal of hazardous waste since low chromium content was present in the leachate extract. The compressive strength of the mortars was reduced with the increase of sand replacement by the recycled lightweight aggregate, reaching up to 72% loss compared to the reference mortars. However, the effect on the compressive strength of the mortars found in this study is lower than other polymer-based lightweight aggregates, showing good potential for the application of the developed material as non-structural elements.

In the development of many computer projects, the variability and flexibility of user interface requirements have greatly increased the complexity of program development for researchers. In addition, the poor reusability of page access control writing has created a pressing need for a highly standardized and flexible way of developing software. Thus, the development and design of user interfaces for application software systems occupy an important position and have been a hot topic of research in the field of human-computer interaction. The traditional methods of describing user interaction, such as state transitions and data flow diagrams, are not based on global and intuitive concepts. Moreover, there is little support for the design of user interface interaction behavior, resulting in user interfaces being ignored at design time and left to implementers to grasp at coding time. It is therefore an issue that needs to be addressed in order to integrate traditional methods and intuitive descriptions from the user's perspective into a new interface development model and methodology. This research creates a user interface framework based on interaction behavior from the user's perspective. Furthermore, UML extension mechanisms are used to enable the user interface framework to better support UML-based modelling environments. In addition, the UML is structured and extended to include structural elements that support interface generation, and a structured use case model is proposed, which drives the analysis and design of the individual submodels. The extracted abstract interface elements and their mapping to concrete interface elements are documented in a way that explores the generation of different target languages under different platforms. This study incorporates user requirements and provides a scientific reference for the development and design of user interfaces. © 2022 Yiyi Zhao.",,"Access control; Application programs; Behavioral research; Digital storage; Human computer interaction; Reusability; Computer network technology; Design systems; Extension mechanisms; Interaction behavior; Interaction design; Interface elements; Program development; UML extension; User interface requirements; Users perspective; User interfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85133202403

Hence, the polymer blends and composites reinforced with different infusions at different scales, macro to nanofillers, can be fabricated, leading to specific tailormade applications. The main objective of this investigation is to overview the various studies carried out to reuse the waste materials like electroplating sludge, fly ash, etc. For the development of construction materials. This paper summarizes the use of polymers in composite material formulations for the development of building materials such as lightweight concrete, protective coatings, paver blocks, bricks, and structural components. Different tests, namely viscosity, density, flash point, amine value, and epoxy equivalent weight, were performed on polymers to find their suitability as binder materials. Various laboratory tests such as compressive strength, water absorption, tear resistance, flexural strength, and split tensile tests were carried out to determine the mechanical properties of the developed materials. By using polymers with the addition of sustainable filler and waste materials, the replacement of costly raw material can be achieved by more than 50% in the case of paver blocks, up to 60% in bitumen-polymer composite, 80% in case of lightweight concrete and polymer-based panels. This insight gives the framework for the selection of different materials, optimization of combining ratio of materials, and their testing for the development of polymer-based materials. © 2022 Ashmita Rupal et al.",,"Binders; Compressive strength; Filled polymers; Fillers; Fly ash; Light weight concrete; Polymer blends; Tensile testing; Water absorption; Buildings materials; Composites material; Electroplating sludge; Flash points; Nanofiller; Polymer composite; Property; Reuse; Structural component; Sustainable construction; Protective coatings",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85132430229

To achieve this goal, the residual performance of used steel must be evaluated. For seismic areas, the residual performance after experiencing an earthquake, large or small, must be quantified. Therefore, the residual performance of hot rolled I-shapes, of grades SS400, SN400B and SN490B, after plastic deformation and strain aging was examined through three test series: (I) tension coupon tests; (II) cyclic tension-and-compression coupon tests; and (III) cyclically loaded beam tests. The tests were conducted in two phases: pre loading to predetermined plastic deformation, and subsequently, after curing for 1 or 3 months at ambient temperature, loading to larger plastic deformation. The SS400 with free nitrogen content of 0.006 wt% saw substantial strain aging effects, while SN400B and SN490B with free nitrogen content of 0.003 and 0.002 wt% saw smaller effects. In the beam tests, pre-loading to ±0.02 rad resulted in up to 25% increase in yield strength but little change in maximum strength and plastic deformation capacity. Residual deformation of the beam was within geometric tolerances after cyclic loading to ±0.01 rad, but exceeded some tolerance items after cyclic loading to ±0.02 rad. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Beams; Cyclic-loading tests; Plastic deformation; Residual performance; Reuse; Strain aging","Building materials; Earthquakes; Fits and tolerances; Hot rolling; Nitrogen; Plastic deformation; Steel construction; Beam; Beam tests; Coupon tests; Cyclic loading test; Nitrogen content; Preloading; Residual performance; Reuse; Strain ageing; Structural steels; Cyclic loads",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85130299284

This study represents a new strategy for upgrading of whey to 3′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine (3′-SLN) as an important structural component of glycoproteins and a receptor analog capable of forming complexes with hemagglutinins on influenza viruses. N-Acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) was enzymatically produced and purified directly from whey with no pretreatment required. An engineered and recombinantly produced sialidase with trans-sialylation ability from the non-pathogenic Trypanosoma rangeli was then used to transfer sialic acid from whey-derived, sialylated casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) to this LacNAc. A maximum of 0.92 mM 3′-SLN was obtained at an equimolar ratio of LacNAc to bound sialic acid in CGMP; on the other hand, a molar ratio of 10 gave a fourfold greater 3′-SLN concentration. The variations in the concentration of 3′-SLN and free sialic acid during the hydrolysis reaction were modeled under different reaction conditions using machine learning and mechanistic approaches. The mechanistic analysis of the reaction indicated that the relative initial trans-sialylation rate to hydrolysis rate is directly proportional to the initial LacNAc concentration, with the ratio of trans-sialylation to hydrolysis rate constants equal to 111 M-1. The maximum 3′-SLN yield obtained was 75% based on α-2,3-sialic acid bound to CGMP. Separation of CGMP and reuse of enzyme were also investigated in an enzymatic membrane reactor. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","biocatalyst; casein glycomacropeptide; lactose; machine learning; sialidases","Bioreactors; Casein; Hydrolysis; Molar ratio; Rate constants; Bioactives; Biocatalyst; Casein glycomacropeptide; Economic development; Environmental development; Enzymatic production; Pharmaceutical products; Sialic acids; Sialidases; Sialylation; Viruses",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85128905453

However, the reuse of organic wastes in coatings like plasters and renders has been poorly studied. This paper shows the effect of tire rubber wastes on the mechanical properties and fire performance of gypsum plasters. The rubber waste was added to the mixture in mass percentages of 14.50% (C1) and 46.60% (C2). Flexural and compressive strength of plasters made with rubber wastes was visibly reduced as well as their surface hardness (Shore C). In addition, fire tests produced major damages through the entire 2 cm thickness of samples containing rubber wastes, as it was corroborated by X ray diffraction (XRD) and Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The heat transfer due to fire exposure modified considerably the chemical composition of plasters, since, on the non-exposed face to fire, the amount of gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) equivalent to mass loss obtained by TG due to water released by these plasters made with rubber wastes, was 5.4-7.2 lower than that of conventional plasters. The results suggest that certain wastes may reduce the efficiency of gypsum plasters in protecting underneath construction and structural elements against fire. ©2022 CSIC.","Fire; Gypsum; Passive protection; Temperature; Tire rubber waste","Coatings; Fire extinguishers; Fire protection; Fires; Heat transfer; Plaster; Thermogravimetric analysis; Tires; Construction elements; Fire behaviour; Fire performance; Inorganics; Organic wastes; Passive protection; Reuse; Structural elements; Tyre rubber wastes; Gypsum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85127181472

The most evident interpretation is formal and is represented by the shape given to the structure, which depicts a bud. The mechanical behavior of bent raw bamboo culms that are in the process of releasing their elastic energy and spread upwards is used to symbolize the retained vital energy included in buds. Finally, the building material, chosen to be left almost untouched after harvesting, and the design of structural details, which foster to reuse of structural elements, actualize the reference to the nature given by the contest theme. The design process started from the conceptualization and admiration for raw bamboo culms that are taken as the main and determinant elements of the project. The design choices take advantage of the several aspects connected with the use of this building material such as its strength and weathering, ease of use, assembly, and dismantling costs. We were also concerned about emphasizing the ecological, economical, aesthetic, and mechanical properties of the raw material such as the high specific resistance to traction and bending and the natural cylindrical shape of culms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Active-bending; Bamboo culm; Reusable joints",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85126687039

Prestressing CFRP plates is one of the efficient solutions used to utilize the high strength of CFRP plates to improve the performance of concrete structures. In order to prestress a CFRP plate, anchorages are required to grip the plate at its both ends. However, anchoring a CFRP plate is a challenging task due to its vulnerability to lateral loading. Hence, a novel compact wedge anchorage system for CFRP plate was developed and tested. The wedge anchorage is composed of an outer cylindrical steel barrel, two steel wedges, and two soft copper plates. The performance of the wedge anchorage was experimentally investigated under tensile loading. Two different presetting levels were applied: high presetting using a hydraulic press and low presetting by manual hammering. The reliability of the wedge anchorage was illustrated by successfully gripping the CFRP plate until its full tensile strength was attained. The reusability of the wedge anchorage was demonstrated by its consistent performance throughout the repeated tests. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CFRP plate; Concrete strengthening; Presetting; Prestressing; Wedge anchorage","Anchorages (foundations); Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Plates (structural components); Reinforced concrete; Reusability; Strengthening (metal); Tensile strength; A-carbon; Anchorings; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer plate; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Concrete strengthening; Fibre reinforced polymer plates; High-strength; Performance; Presetting; Wedge anchorage; Prestressing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121917788

It plays an important role in tree skeleton extraction, tree pruning, tree model reconstruction and other fields. Because the area of a single leaf is smaller than that of the whole tree, the segmentation of branches and leaves is a challenging problem. In view of the above problems, this paper first migrates PointNet to the tree branch and leaf point cloud segmentation, and proposes an automatic segmentation method based on improved PointNet. According to the difference of normal direction between leaves and branches, the point cloud information of three dimensions coordinates, color and normal vector is input into the point feature space. In data processing, increase the number of each block data, so that the network can better learn features. MLP is added to the original PointNet network to improve the ability of extracting and learning local features. In addition, in the process of feature extraction, jump connection is added to realize feature reuse and make full use of different levels of features. The original 1×1 filter of PointNet is replaced by 3×1 filter to improve the segmentation accuracy of tree point cloud. The focus loss function focal loss is introduced into the field of 3D point cloud to reduce the impact of the imbalance of point cloud samples on the results. The results show that the improved method improves the accuracy of tree branch point cloud segmentation compared with the original PointNet for branch and leaf segmentation. The segmentation accuracy of structural elements of branches and leaves is more than 88%, and MIoU is 48%. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This approach is clearly wasteful of energy, creating serious environmental pollution and at high cost. However, design for demountability/deconstruction (DfD) of reinforced concrete structures would facilitate the future reuse of structural elements at the end of their life, potentially achieving a significant reduction in embodied energy of structures as well as giving the clients the benefit of retaining the value of their assets. In this paper, recent research developments and practical applications of DfD of reinforced concrete structures are reviewed and key technical issues are discussed. The main focus was on connections that should be designed in such a way to allow demounting. The main achievements are outlined, for each type of dry and semi dry connections, along with the aspects that still need to be developed. It is concluded that only semi-dry connections are currently implemented but information available in the literature on dry connections between structural elements is still very scarce.

However, the catalytic enantioselective synthesis of structurally diverse 1,2-dihydropyridines is limited to enantioselective addition of nucleophiles to activated pyridines. Here, we report a modular organocatalytic Mannich/Wittig/cycloisomerization sequence as a flexible strategy to access chiral 1,2-dihydropyridines from N-Boc aldimines, aldehydes, and phosphoranes, using a chiral amine catalyst. The key step in this protocol, cycloisomerization of chiral N-Boc δ-amino α,β-unsaturated ketones recycles the waste to improve the yield. Specifically, recycling by-product water from imine formation to gradually release the true catalyst HCl via hydrolysis of SiCl4, whilst maintaining a low concentration of HCl to suppress side reactions, and reusing waste Ph3PO from the Wittig step to modulate the acidity of HCl.

Replacing free nano-powders with active and stable films is thus a fundamental step towards developing effective photocatalytic devices. Aluminum represents a cheap and technologically-relevant substrate, but its photocatalytic applications have been hampered by adhesion issues and metal ion diffusion within the photocatalytic layer. In this work, the use of silica interlayers is investigated as a strategy to promote adhesion, efficiency and reusability of TiO2 films deposited on aluminum plates. Films were prepared from stable titania sols to avoid the use of nano-powders. Aluminum substrates with different surface morphology were investigated and the role of the silica interlayer thickness was studied. Films were extensively characterized, studying their structure, morphology, optical properties, adhesion and hardness. Self-cleaning properties were studied with respect to their superhydrophilicity and ability to resist fouling via alkylsilanes. Photocatalytic degradation tests were carried out using both volatile organic compounds and NO x , also in recycle tests. The presence of the silica interlayer proved crucial to promote the film robustness and photocatalytic activity. The substrate morphology determined the optimal interlayer thickness, especially in terms of the film reusability. © 2021 IOP Publishing Ltd.","air pollution; indoor pollution; nitrogen oxides; photocatalytic oxidation; self-cleaning; smart coating","Adhesion; Air cleaners; Aluminum; Aluminum coatings; Aluminum plating; Metal ions; Morphology; Optical properties; Oxide minerals; Plates (structural components); Powder metals; Reusability; Silica; Sols; Substrates; Superhydrophilicity; Surface morphology; Titanium dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Water treatment; Environmental issues; Interlayer thickness; Photo catalytic degradation; Photocatalytic application; Photocatalytic devices; Photocatalytic film; Self-cleaning properties; Substrate morphologies; Photocatalytic activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114823970

Nonlinear finite element analysis is used to study the monotonic pushover behavior of TeSA walls with different edge tile configurations and a comparison is made thereof with a conventional reinforced concrete shear wall. The results indicate that the strength of TeSA walls is not significantly affected by the configuration of edge tiles. Damage progression in tiles and the number of damaged tiles that need to be replaced are also presented at different drift ratios.

Besides, construction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. According to the waste hierarchies, reuse is preferred to recycling; however, most of the recovery of construction and demolition wastes happens in the form of recycling and not reuse. Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts’ opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study. Furthermore, the results of the survey are used to develop an easy-to-understand learner for assessing the technical reusability of the structural elements at the end-of-life of a building.

To help curb the vicious circle of increasing structural and environmental degradation, the sustainable probability is defined as a conditional probability, and the interaction between structural reliability and environmental impacts is quantified. Global warming potential (GWP) is adopted as the key indicator for environmental impacts. By analyzing the trends of climate change, the GWP limit is set to match the prediction of structural resistance degradation. A new environmental impact allocation rule based on time-dependent resistance is put forward to characterize the environmental benefits of the reuse strategy. With help of the durability life prediction method for reusable components and the stochastic model for time-dependent resistance, the calculation method for sustainable probability is established, catering for both reusable and non-reusable structural components. With the Monte Carlo simulation, the proposed sustainability design process is implemented in a numerical example. Results show that the reusable structural concrete component design can simultaneously satisfy the current and future safety and environmental requirements, meeting the demand for sustainable development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Allocation; Climate change; Component reuse; Environmental impacts; Structural sustainability; Sustainable probability","Concretes; Design; Environmental impact; Global warming; Monte Carlo methods; Probability; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Conditional probabilities; Environmental benefits; Environmental requirement; Global warming potential; Structural concretes; Structural reliability; Structural resistance; Sustainability designs; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105265002

Moreover, the refurbishment and reuse are extremely important in structural components likely to be subjected to harsh operating conditions (dynamic loads and elevated temperatures). That is why additive manufacturing processes are rising as disruptive techniques for the restoration of Inconel 718 components. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the mechanical properties of this nickel-base superalloy in harsh conditions. The objective of this study is to evaluate the coupled effect of strain-rates (0.001, 200 and 800 s−1) and temperatures (20, 350 and 550 °C) on Inconel 718 additive manufactured samples produced by Direct Energy Deposition. A raw Inconel 718 material for the preparation of as-cast samples has been also investigated, and the mechanical results have been compared. The mechanical characterisation at high strain-rates has been performed through a SHTB equipped with a water-cooled induction heating system. Similar mechanical behaviour has been observed between samples realised with a power laser of 400 W and as-cast samples. A gradual decrease of the mechanical strengths is observed for increasing temperatures. The calibration of the Johnson-Cook strength model highlighted the necessity of using specific thermal softening values as a function of fixed strain-rate and temperature. © 2021 The Authors","Elevated temperatures; High strain-rates; Inconel 718; Laser metal deposition; Material constitutive laws; Tensile tests","3D printers; Additives; Deposition; Dynamic loads; Induction heating; Nickel alloys; Restoration; Tensile testing; As-cast; Cost-intensive; Elevated temperature; High-strain-rate; Inconel 718 alloy; Inconel-718; Laser metal deposition; Material constitutive law; Mechanical; Rate behavior; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107682785

One way to approach the carbon neutrality is through reuse of structural components. In order to enable economic reuse of precast concrete elements, their connections must be designed to allow an effortless dismount. While dismount ability provides additional value to the structure, it cannot have a negative impact on other crucial properties of the connection. One of those properties is the load-transfer capacity. While the impact of improved demountability on the load-transfer of axial forces is negligible, the capacity of such joints to transfer shear forces can be questioned, as it is often assumed to rely on the friction generated along compressed section.

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables.

One of the most expensive components of a RLV is the thermal protection system (TPS), which preserves the spacecraft from the high thermal loads during re-entry. Reusability and on-orbit environment are key parameters in TPS design, mainly as far as the adopted materials are concerned. Aim of the work is to analyze a novel TPS concept, proposing an hybrid multiscale ceramic coating - i.e., alumina-based varnish enriched by silica nanoparticles - to be applied on Carbon/Carbon (C/C) plates. The treatment is aimed at preserving the thermo-mechanical properties of the ceramic substrate from the detrimental space environment conditions, such as LEO thermal cycles, outgassing due to ultra-high vacuum, as well as Atomic Oxygen/UV irradiation. Experimental measurements of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) are performed in order to evaluate the thermal stress and performance of both substrate and coating layer. Particular emphasis is devoted to evaluate the effect of coating/substrate adhesion, which may result in anomalous mechanical behavior. By the use of a robust numerical technique, known as the inverse method, heat capacity and thermal conductivity are analyzed; such approach is particularly suited to address these kind of problems, as a number of physical parameters concur for a reliable determination of material properties. The special test equipment and the regularizing algorithm for solving the heat conduction problem are described.

Key to this method is the optimization of structural members and joints (i.e. the kit of parts) that fit multiple geometries and different structural requirements. The proposed method includes form finding and digital fabrication and it applies to the design of trusses, gridshells, and space frames.

There are three main ways of dealing with polymer waste: reuse in an un-changed form, recycling (both material and energy), and disposal (mainly in the form of landfilling or incineration). The legislation of European countries promotes in particular two forms of waste management: reuse and recycling. Recycling processes are used to recover materials and energy especially from contaminated waste, which are structurally changed by other materials, friction, temperature, machine, process, etc. The recycling of polymers, especially of multi-plastic structural elements, requires the use of special technological installations and a series of preparatory opera-tions, including crushing and separating. Due to the universality and necessity of materials processing in recycling engineering, in particular size reduction, the aim of this study is to organize and systematize knowledge about shredding in the recycling process of end-of-life polymeric materials. This could help properly design these processes in the context of sustainable development and circular economy. Firstly, an overview of the possibilities of end-of-life plastics management was made, and the meaning of shredding in the end-of-life pathways was described. Then, the development of comminution in recycling processes was presented, with special emphasis given to quasi-cutting as the dominant mode of comminution of polymeric materials. The phenomenon of quasi-cutting, as well as factors related to the material, the operation of the shredding machine, and the technological process affecting it were described. Research conducted on quasi-cutting as a phenomenon when cutting single material samples and quasi-cutting as a machine process was char-acterized. Then, issues regarding recycling potentials in the context of shredding were systematized. Considerations included the areas of material, technical, energy, human, and control potentials. Presented bases and models can be used to support the innovation of creative activities, i.e., environmentally friendly actions, that produce specific positive environmental results in the mechanical processing of recycled and reused materials. The literature survey indicates the need to explore the environmental aspect of the shredding process in recycling and connect the shredding process var-iables with environmental consequences. This will help to design and control the processes to get the lowest possible environmental burdens. © 2021 by the authors.

Transportable modules will ease the process of returning the modules to the factory for reuse and recycling of structural steel at the end of their lifetime. A previous comparison between the proposed case studies has shown that the off-grid case can reduce the global warming potential by 76% in Shanghai when compared to a business-as-usual scenario. Generally, there is only a limited number of studies of container buildings with a simulation of the annual energy need in the literature. Particularly there is a lack of studies of residential buildings designed for off-grid operation. This study expands a previous study of the case buildings by improved control strategies in TRNSYS to reduce the required PV capacity and thereby the embodied emissions. For instance, thermal storage has been included to reduce the amount of dumped energy. Also, ventilation and indoor temperature have been controlled based on ambient temperature, state of charge, day, and time. In cold climates, Photovoltaic thermal (PVT), floor heating, and a generator have been added to increase the heating load. The results show that providing thermal comfort in the heating season is the main challenge, both because of the lower coefficient of performance for the heat pump and due to the lower PV generation. According to the predicted effects of climate change, the energy need for space heating is predicted to be reduced by on average 23% towards 2050 for the five climate zones in China which are considered, which would make it easier to provide thermal comfort. The current study helps to provide a reference to lower the costs for planning and improve the quality. The study is significant because China, who account for about 50% of new construction globally, is targeting to increase its prefabricated construction by 30% within ten years. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Modular construction; Off-grid; Residential building; Solar PV; Zero energy building","Battery management systems; Building materials; Charging (batteries); Coefficient of performance; Containers; Global warming; Heat storage; Modular construction; Photovoltaic cells; Solar buildings; Space heating; Thermal comfort; Container buildings; Global warming potential; Indoor temperature; Photovoltaic thermals; Residential building; Reuse and recycling; Shipping containers; Solar photovoltaics; Zero energy buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097716251

Upon closer inspection, anomalies were revealed and their causes were found to be related to the installation of the new deck. This work intends to contribute to the structural evaluation and rehabilitation of steel bridges through numerical analysis. For this purpose, a three-dimensional numerical finite-element model of the structure using the SAP2000 version 15 software was developed, in which the acting loads were applied according to the Brazilian standards. The outcomes obtained by the performed nonlinear analysis indicate the occurrence of buckling due to the axial compression load in some structural elements, a phenomenon also observed during the bridge's first inspection. Thus, to ensure that the bridge is safely reused, the locking of the truss diagonals is proposed as a structural reinforcement. Additionally, the posts' lateral locking of the three end spans is recommended. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Numerical analysis; Steel bridges; Structural safety","Nonlinear analysis; Railroads; Axial compression load; Concrete deck; Minas Gerais , Brazil; Railway bridges; Structural elements; Structural evaluation; Structural reinforcement; Structural safety; Locks (fasteners)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091942273

Many applications for flexural and shear strengthening can be realized but a typical intervention is the transversal confinement with angles and strips to increase the axial load capacity of columns. However, the design provisions for this application are still lack even if specific rules are necessary because the confinement effect can be strongly influenced by the amount and geometric configuration of the external steel. In this paper a detailed 3D FE model of RC columns confined with external steel plates is proposed. The model is firstly calibrated on available experimental results available in the scientific literature obtaining a good agreement of the loading capacity. The influence of the perfect bond between the steel angles and the RC column is evaluated too. Finally, the model is used for considering the variation of the steel configuration in terms of strips spacing and thickness of the steel elements. © Fédération Internationale du Béton (fib) – International Federation for Structural Concrete.","Bond; Confinement; Finite element model; Steel plate; Strengthening","3D modeling; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Efficiency; Plates (structural components); Axial load capacity; Confinement effects; Design provisions; Geometric configurations; Loading capacities; Scientific literature; Shear strengthening; Stress strain behaviours; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134830511

A potential path to increase sustainability is to integrate circular economy principles in structural design, which advocate for prioritizing the reuse of structural materials to extend their service life, limiting their physical transformation to locational and functional changes. In this way, structural projects of the past can not only serve as an inspiration for the future, but the material itself can also be reappropriated. Recently, computational approaches for material reuse have gained traction. This paper extends previous work by comparing several algorithmic formulations for reuse-driven design, introducing a new Grasshopper-based tool that implements them, and demonstrating their application on a case study. © fédération internationale du béton (fib).",,"Structural design; Circular designs; Circular economy; Computational approach; Embodied carbons; Functional changes; Material reuse; Structural elements; Structural systems; Conceptual design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85134812634

Hence, effective management of this sludge is important for its reuse and safe disposal. Considering the utilization of this waste in construction activities, the current paper explores the potential of textile sludge produced from textile industry effluent treatment plants. Many researchers have attempted to reuse this sludge for the development of sustainable construction materials and suggested its optimum usage as a partial substitution for fine aggregate, cement and clay with or without additives for the manufacturing of non-structural building components. This paper provides a critical review of the production of non-structural elements-namely, sustainable building blocks, clay bricks, mortar and paver blocks-using textile effluent treatment plant sludge and recommends optimum ranges of 5-30, 5-40, 5-50 and 20-40%, respectively.

However, bolted engineering structures often encounter vibration-induced joint faults like self-loosening, crack, leakage and corrosion since they are generally subjected to external dynamic loads caused by vibration environments. Joint damages would seriously affect structures' reliability and durability, and increase maintenance costs. Therefore, fault detection of bolted engineering structures is very important and necessary. For beam-like and ring-type engineering structures with single excitation and multiple damaged bolted joints, various methods monitoring changes in nonlinear structural features have been developed. To avoid the use of structural features from benchmark structures for reference during the derivation of damage indicators, a novel vibration-based fault detection approach utilizing features from damaged structures only is proposed in this study. In the new method, the dynamic model of bolted engineering structures is simplified as a general MDOF model with nonlinear elements simulating nonlinear bolt loosening faults. By changing the value of related mass, three similar equations from the damaged structure are used to form one matrix, and then the singularity of matrix is used to detect the existence and position of faults. Results from simulations on the beam-like and ring-type models with multiple damages demonstrate that the proposed approach could be an effective tool to estimate the state of bolted engineering structures. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

Here, we report the fabrication of covalent-cross-linked, CNF-based anisotropic aerogels through silane condensation and subsequent freeze-drying. The resulting aerogels show lamellar structures along the axial direction, enhanced hydrophilicity, excellent water resistance (soaked in water for 12 months without breakdown), and outstanding underwater mechanical toughness (without damage after 500 compression-release cycles). Also, the aerogels show an unusual underoil superhydrophilicity, which allows the aerogels to separate surfactant-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions through absorption with a high separation efficiency of 99.6%. Meanwhile, the excellent anti-oil-fouling ability endowed the aerogels with high recycle stability and reusability. Taking advantage of powerful antigravity water transportation (transfer rate of 3.75 mm/s at a height of 2.5 cm) imposed by the enhanced hydrophilicity and the interconnected radial-aligned channels, the aerogels were applied as structural components of the solar vapor generator, which showed a relatively high evaporation rate of 1.83 kg m-2 h-1 and water evaporation efficiency of 95.9% under one solar irradiation. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","aerogel; cellulose nanofiber; oleophobicity; superelasticity; superhydrophilicity","Cellulose; Cellulose nanocrystals; Efficiency; Emulsification; Emulsions; Evaporation; Lamellar structures; Nanocellulose; Nanofibers; Reusability; Separation; Solar power generation; Superhydrophilicity; Water absorption; Cellulose nanofibers; High evaporation rate; High separation efficiency; Mechanical toughness; Structural component; Surfactant-stabilized; Water in oil emulsions; Water transportation; Aerogels",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114679364

Fracture failure in steel structures should be prevented to avoid collapse of the whole structures. Micromechanical fracture models can capture the fracture initiation mechanisms and therefore can be used to predict ductile fractures in steel. Twelve smooth round bars were carried out to obtain the material properties and 36 notched round bars were tested to calibrate the parameters of stress modified critical strain (SMCS) model and the void growth model (VGM) for structural steels (Q235B and Q345B) and the corresponding welds. Specimens were extracted from the base metal, the weld metal and the heat affected zone (HAZ) to investigate fracture behaviour in different parts of the welded joint. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements were taken and finite element models were developed to calibrate the models. The test results and calibrated parameters are reported. Moreover, the calibrated models are applied to analyses the fracture behaviour of welded joints and their accuracy are validated. The calibrated and validated models can be used for further numerical fracture analysis in welded steel structures. © 2021 by The Hong Kong Institute of Steel Construction.

It is commonly known as an environmentally friendly pile method. It generates no surplus soil nor muddy water during installation by screwing the pile into the ground with its helical plate at pile tip. On the other hand, by rotating reversely, it can be pulled out and retrieved, thus also be recycled and reused if necessary. This article presents the recycling and reusing procedure and criteria of screw steel pile EAZET based on experience. For safe and smooth retrieval, capable machine should be chosen carefully in advance. The capacity of the machine and the torque during retrieval should be constantly noticed, especially when the retrieval is conducted long time after installation. The reason is that the ground disturbed by the pile installation has recovered, where it requires larger torque for pulling out. Retrieved piles will be examined via visual check, dimension check, and bending test of the pile shaft. After that, they will be divided into reusable members and non-reusable members. Reusable members can be repaired for future reuse. On the other hand, non-reusable members are recycled as reproduction materials for components in recycling factory. Recyclable and reusable features of EAZET enable it to be further adopted by temporary structures besides its original market. It can contribute to the transformation from economical society to recycling society where the efficient usage and recycling are emphasized. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Environmental friendly method; Recycle; Reuse; Screw steel pile; Sustainable society","Cell proliferation; Plates (structural components); Recycling; Screws; Muddy waters; Pile installation; Pile shaft; Pulling out; Recycling factories; Reusable member; Steel piles; Temporary structures; Piles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104472880

The aim of this study was to investigate the wood properties of old wooden elements not impregnated with any protective chemicals and taken from different parts of Zeytinlik houses in Giresun, Turkey. Test samples were prepared from old wooden elements and freshly cut chestnut timber. The anatomical, chemical, physical and mechanical properties were determined according to standard procedure, and the results were compared with those of recent wood specimen. As a result of the anatomical identification, it was determined that the wooden elements used in traditional Zeytinlik houses belong to species of Anatolian chestnut (Castanea sativa), and after an average service life of 88, 113 and 120 years, there was no change in the anatomical structure of the old wooden elements. Fourier transform infrared band characterization of old wood specimens revealed that hemicelluloses degraded and lignin structure changed on the surface of almost all specimens. Especially, the wood density values of the facade elements were smaller than that of recent wood specimen. Except for the modulus of rupture of window sill and rafter, all mechanical properties were significantly greater compared with those of recent wood specimen.

It is amplifying every day in terms of technology which provides new solution to several problems. The process of 3D printing with cement-based mixes does not use formwork and thus gives increased flexibility to designers, saves the cost of labor and materials and reduces waste. Printers have been used to construct structural elements and full-scale buildings. But construction has been dealing with one of the major issue, which is the waste management. Stone sludge is one of the most abundantly produced wastes in stone quarries which have been dumped in landfill with low percentage of reuse. This research paper focuses on integrating stone sludge waste from the transformation industry as raw material in the mortar, having the objective to do 3D printing in a cost-effective and affordable way. An experimental work was carried out to obtain convenient mixes to print, evaluating some physical and mechanical properties of casted samples and comparing stone sludge-based mortar with traditional mortar mixes. Mortar specimens were obtained using a robotic arm with an extrusion printing process. Six mortar types with different proportions of stone sludge and admixtures were tested in a systematic way to determine their printable properties. The outcome of the test is presented, discussing possible reasons, factors, and relations between the results obtained.

In the shift towards CE, examining the CE from the perspective of its potential is crucial for its wider and more effective implementation in the practice. The aim of the paper is to clarify a circularity phenomenon in closed-loop economy under the notion of potential in part of (1) the structural elements, (2) underlying categories and (3) basal properties as a follow-up to the previous studies about managing the circularity potential. The study provides the theoretical framework for understanding circularity potential by developing the circularity potential categorization in order to get a comprehensive picture of what has been done in the past and where efforts are most need today to achieve a progress towards circularity in the future. The basal properties of circularity potential such as integrity, dyna-mism, territorial affiliation and different strategies compatibility were revealed and discussed for managing the circularity potential. The findings of the paper have ambition to contribute to new metrics development to measure the progress towards zero-waste and CE aimed at identification and monitoring all the possible forms of the circularity potential – opportunities, reserves, available resources, rather than the available resources only that were primarily considered in the past attempts at the operationalisation of circular economy. © 2020, Politechnika Lubelska.

Recycling solves the problem of their storage and adverse environmental impact. Six different formulas of epoxy resins were tested, differing in the type of polymer, the mixing process (sonication or not) and the presence of microsilica. The study showed that microsilica added to the epoxy resin changes its viscosity and free surface energy, and these are the parameters that determine the adhesion of the polymer to the concrete surface. Strength tests and SEM analysis have determined how microsilica molecules can penetrate the structure of polymer macromolecules by filling and forming temporary chemical bonds. Mixing the fillers with the adhesive was achieved by using a sonication process. The analysis of the obtained results showed that, depending on the initial composition of the polymer, the addition of microsilica can change the chemical, physical and mechanical properties of the hardened adhesive to varying degrees. In the case of adhesives used in the construction industry to strengthen and glue structural elements, these changes significantly affect the durability of the adhesive joints. © 2020 by the authors.

The main advantage of this concrete is the reuse of construction debris which is a huge management problem in addition to complying with countries' requirements for recycling rates. This technology will also solve the problem of shortage of natural resources from which many countries suffer. Thus, this new technology is at the forefront of research and improvement studies in order to identify the technical characteristics: Mechanical properties, formulation, durability ... of a new concrete based on these aggregates. Morocco, as a developing country, favors the promotion of new technologies.

Our experiment results indicate that the designed deep learning network achieved detection accuracy comparable to other deep learning methods in the frontal license plate images datasets, and much better in the complex scenarios such as tilt or blur. © 2020 ACM.","Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; License Plate Detection","Aviation; Deep learning; Feature extraction; Learning systems; License plates (automobile); Network architecture; Plates (structural components); Safety engineering; Detection accuracy; Learning methods; Learning network; License plate detection; License plate images; Multiscale detection; Network structures; Novel neural network; Complex networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099399800

In this paper, we present a PCGML approach for level generation that is able to recombine, adapt, and reuse structural patterns from several domains to approximate unseen domains. We extend prior work involving example-driven Binary Space Partitioning for recombining and reusing patterns in multiple domains, and incorporate Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for generating unseen structures. We evaluate our approach by blending across 7 domains and subsets of those domains. We show that our approach is able to blend domains together while retaining structural components. Additionally, by using different groups of training domains our approach is able to generate both 1) levels that reproduce and capture features of a target domain, and 2) levels that have vastly different properties from the input domain. © 2020 ACM.","binary space partitioning; level blending; level generation; PCGML; procedural content generation; variational autoencoder","Blending; Computer games; Binary space partitioning; Human creativity; Multi domains; Multiple domains; Procedural content generations; Structural component; Structural pattern; Target domain; Learning systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092297310

However, excluding geometrical and material nonlinearities from the numerical substructure might make a significant difference in internal force redistribution and reduce the simulation accuracy beyond acceptable levels. Also, materials at a high temperature very often exhibit time-dependent behavior, including strain-rate dependency, high-temperature creep, and stress relaxation, which prohibit the use of extended testing time scales. This standpoint motivated the development of the real-time hybrid fire simulation method presented in this paper. Dynamic relaxation is proposed to solve the static response of the hybrid numerical-experimental fire simulation. As an equivalent dynamic solution method, dynamic relaxation allows for coupling substructure equations of motion by using a partitioned time integration approach. Minimal data exchange between substructures and negligible computational overhead plus ease of reusability of verified finite-element software makes the proposed algorithm suitable for coordinating real-time hybrid fire simulations. The hybrid fire simulation of a virtual steel frame case study is reported as a validation example. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Component-mode synthesis; Dynamic relaxation; Hybrid fire simulation; Partitioned time integration; Steel frame","Computer software reusability; Creep testing; Electronic data interchange; Equations of motion; Reusability; Strain rate; Stress relaxation; Computational overheads; Finite element software; High temperature creep; Internal force redistribution; Material non-linearity; Numerical experimental; Strain rate dependency; Time dependent behavior; Fires; algorithm; fire; simulation; software; static response; steel; strain rate; structural component",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090425742

As a new structural steel, the post-fire mechanical properties, regarded as a crucial indicator to assess structural damage and reusability after fire, need to be studied. Hence, a comprehensive experimental investigation on the influence of two artificial cooling methods on post-fire mechanical properties of Q355 steel is reported in this study. The specimens were first heated to target temperatures of 200 °C, 400 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C to simulate various fire conditions and then cooled by fire-extinguishing foam cooling and water cooling. Uniaxial tensile tests were performed on these fire-affected specimens to extract the stress–strain curves and associated post-fire mechanical properties. Additionally, fracture behavior of Q355 steel cooled by the two artificial cooling methods was also discussed from macroscopic and microscopic fracture morphology. For the two artificial cooling methods, it is explicitly found that the loss of mechanical properties of Q355 steel is negligible after exposure to temperatures below 600 °C. However, both cooling methods and elevated temperatures have significant effects on post-fire mechanical properties of Q355 steel after the exposure temperature exceeds 600 °C. In case of fire-extinguishing foam cooling, a dramatic decrease in yield strength and ultimate strength is observed, while the ductility is gradually increased with increasing temperature. In contrast, a sharp increase in yield strength and ultimate strength can be observed clearly, while the ductility is sharply reduced with increasing temperature. After exposure to the temperature of 900 °C, Q355 steel cooled by fire-extinguishing foam is able to retain 79% of its original ultimate strength, while Q355 steel cooled by water is able to gain 131% of its original ultimate strength in the as-received state. At last, new equations are developed to predict post-fire mechanical properties of Q355 steel for fire damage evaluation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial cooling methods; Macroscopic fracture characteristics; Micro-fracture mechanism; Post-fire mechanical properties; Proposed equations; Q355 structural steel","Building materials; Cooling; Ductility; Fire extinguishers; Fracture mechanics; Reusability; Steel construction; Strain; Temperature; Tensile testing; Yield stress; Chinese national standard; Elevated temperature; Experimental investigations; Exposure temperature; Fracture morphology; Increasing temperatures; Macroscopic and microscopic; Uniaxial tensile test; Fires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083039104

Therefore, Research and Development (R&D) of novel manufacturing technologies and green construction materials is becoming extremely compelling. This study aims at evaluating the reuse of various wastes, originated in the Kraft pulp-paper industry, as raw materials in the manufacture of novel geopolymeric (GP) mortars whose properties fundamentally depend on the target application (e.g., insulating panel, partition wall, structural element, furnishing, etc.). Five different wastes were reused as filler: Two typologies of Biomass Fly Ash, calcareous sludge, grits, and dregs. The produced samples were characterized and a multi criteria analysis, able to take into account not only the engineering properties, but also the environmental and economic aspects, has been implemented. The criteria weights were evaluated using the Delphi methodology. The fuzzy Topsis approach has been used to consider the intrinsic uncertainty related to unconventional materials, as the produced GP-mortars. The computational analysis showed that adding the considered industrial wastes as filler is strongly recommended to improve the performance of materials intended for structural applications in construction. The results revealed that the formulations containing 5 wt.% of calcareous sludge, grits, and dregs and the one containing 7.5 wt.% of calcareous sludge, grits, dregs, and Biomass Fly Ash-1 have emerged as the best alternatives. Furthermore, it resulted that the Biomass Fly Ash-2 negatively influences the structural performance and relative rank of the material. Finally, this case study clearly shows that the fuzzy Topsis multi-criteria analysis represents a valuable and easy tool to investigate construction materials (either traditional and unconventional) when an intrinsic uncertainty is related to the measurement of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics. © 2020 by the authors.","Construction; Fuzzy topsis; Mortars; Multi criteria analysis; Sustainable geopolymers; Wastes valorization & reuse","construction material; developing world; engineering; fly ash; fuzzy mathematics; manufacturing; mortar; multicriteria analysis; polymer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089493173

A widely used general rule is that if the steel members in the building frame are reasonably straight with no visible distortion after a fire event, it can be reused. If these members are accepted for reuse with minor or no repairs, then the performance of steel members with a high-temperature fire exposure under a future earthquake event should be known. This study investigated the cyclic response of fire exposed steel Welded Unreinforced Flange Web (WUF-W) and Reduced Beam Section (RBS) welded connections. The results showed that fire exposed steel connections are vulnerable to earthquake loading if they are reused with minor or no repairs.

Two criteria are assessed herein for structural elements, namely dimensional tolerance and mechanical strength (7-day levels above 6 MPa). Wood aggregates are introduced by means of a volumetric substitution for sand. Easily demoldable concrete blocks have been produced by means of vibrocompaction. A high vibration frequency is coupled with a compaction process in order to generate semi-dry cylindrical concrete blocks (100 mm in diameter, 200 mm high). The addition of wood into the cementitious composite exerts a noticeable influence on its workability, as well as on its thermophysical and mechanical behaviour. Wood alters how the cementitious composite is hydrated and has an impact on its mechanical strength in compression, which drops considerably with an increase in sawdust content. A 50% rate of substituting poplar sawdust for sand was chosen for testing purposes. This concrete composition actually yields mechanical strength values similar to that of the reference concrete used to manufacture masonry blocks. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Building blocks; Calorimetry; Cement-based composites; Mechanical properties; Poplar sawdust; Thermal properties; Vibrocompation","Aggregates; Concrete industry; Concrete mixtures; Regulatory compliance; Reinforced concrete; Wood; Cementitious composites; Compaction process; Concrete composition; Cylindrical concrete; Dimensional tolerance; Mechanical behaviour; Structural elements; Vibration frequency; Concrete blocks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087833768

Four concrete shear walls with different aspect ratios were designed and tested according to a cyclic loading test to evaluate the seismic behavior. The principle of reuse and recycle were firstly both applied to concrete structures in the domain of this research. It can be found that the existence of the proposed DfD connection changed the cracking pattern and failure modes of the concrete shear wall. The interface between the DfD connection and the concrete wall turned to be the weak part of the whole structure. Moreover, the proposed DfD connection had a limited effect on the load bearing and transferring mode for the slender shear wall, while significantly changed the load resistance of the squat shear wall.

Many studies suggest that adaptive reuse is more sustainable than typical demolition and new construction in terms of environmental, social, and economic impacts. However, these claims are qualitative in nature and are limited to analyses at the project scale. This paper presents a methodology based on Input-Output (IO) models for examining economic and energy impacts of substituting adaptive reuse for new building construction. An IO model for the Province of Ontario, Canada, was developed to study the impacts of adaptive reuse building construction. The building construction industries’ intermediate inputs and final demands were altered in the Ontario IO model to reflect changes in the supply and demand of adaptive reuse buildings in the construction industries. A basic scenario represents the situation where only the building's superstructure and substructure are reused. The basic scenario was then extended to reflect the reuse of internal non-structural components. The Ontario IO model examines impacts to gross domestic product (GDP), industry outputs, employment and energy use (including rebound effects from household consumption changes). It was found that adaptive reuse building construction may benefit Ontario's economy and reduce energy consumption under certain combinations of changes in supply and demand. The desired domain of adaptive reuse construction, where energy use decreases, while GDP and employment increases, is discerned for both the residential and non-residential building construction sectors in Ontario. This methodology may be used for other regions for which IO information exists. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive reuse; Construction; Economic impacts; Energy; Input-output (IO)","Construction industry; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy utilization; Housing; Adaptive re use; Building construction industry; Economic impacts; Energy; Gross domestic products; Input-output; Non-structural components; Reduce energy consumption; Construction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081667408

The aim of this study was to develop a low-cost manufacturing process of composites with reuse of polyethylene bags made of sugarcane ethanol (green polyethylene) reinforced with sisal fibres. The hot compression moulding (185 °C) was used to mould composite structural board. Tensile tests were conducted to evaluate the influence of the reinforcement configuration on the mechanical properties of the composites, considering two arrangements: Woven fibres in (0°/90°) and randomly arranged. The results indicated that the use of woven sisal fibres in (0°/90°) as reinforcement of the green HDPE showed an increase in the tensile strength (33.30%) in contrast to the pure traditional HDPE. Randomly arranged sisal fibre-reinforced green HDPE composites showed higher modulus of elasticity than pure traditional HDPE (76.83%). Composites with woven sisal fibres showed higher values for tensile strength and ultimate strain, and lower modulus of elasticity than composites with randomly arranged sisal fibres. In addition, failure modes of the composites were observed. The results showed the viability of producing these composites by the developed equipment and the potential use of these materials as structural components. © 2020 Bruno Dorneles De Castro et al., published by Sciendo.","biopolymers; natural fibre; sustainability; waste plastic",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089571873

Moreover, after an earthquake, the monolithic form of wet connections leads to the irreparable damages of structural elements. Thereby consumes significant downtime for the reuse of the building. In order to address these issues, the present study focuses on the performance of mechanical device (cleat angle) connections with the incorporation of damage avoidance and easily demountable systems when subjected to reverse cyclic loading. Three precast connections of one-third scaled model with parameters such as no stiffener, single stiffener and double stiffener in cleat angles were proposed. The performance of the precast connections was compared with that of the monolithic connection in terms of load-displacement behavior, load envelope curves, deformation capacity, secant stiffness, energy dissipation, equivalent viscous damping and stiffness degradation. From the test results, the cleat angle with stiffener (single and double) connections performed satisfactorily as compared to that of precast connection with unstiffened cleat angle. Overall, the cleat angle connection with single stiffener satisfied the criteria of speedy construction, easily demountable with minimal structural damage and recommended for the moderate seismic regions. © 2020 Institution of Structural Engineers","Cleat angle; Dissipater; Monolithic connection; Precast beam-column connection; Reverse cyclic loading; Stiffener",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081202222

These methods are relevant when reusing structural elements over multiple service lives. Reuse has the potential to reduce the environmental impact of building structures because it avoids sourcing new material, it reduces waste and it requires little energy. When reusing elements, cross-section and length availability have a major influence on the structural design. In previous own work, design of truss structures from a stock of elements was formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. It was shown that this method produces solutions which are global optima in terms of stock utilization. This work extends previous formulations to stock-constrained optimization of frame structures subject to ultimate and serviceability limit states hence expanding the range of structural typologies that can be designed through reuse. Fundamental to this method is the globally optimal assignment of available stock elements to member positions in the frame structure. Two scenarios are considered: (A) the use of individual stock elements for each member of the frame, and (B) a cutting stock approach, where multiple members of the frame are cut from a single stock element. Numerical case studies are presented to show the applicability of the proposed method to practical designs. To carry out the case studies, a stock of elements was inventoried from shop drawings of deconstructed buildings. Results show that through reusing structural elements a significant reduction of embodied greenhouse gas emissions could be achieved compared to optimized structures made of new elements. © Copyright © 2020 Brütting, Senatore, Schevenels and Fivet.","assignment problem; cutting stock problem; frame structures; greenhouse gas emissions; Life Cycle Assessment; reuse; structural optimization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086166027

To reduce substantially material consumption and waste caused by the construction industry, structures can be designed and built with reused elements. Structural element reuse involves: element sourcing and deconstruction, reconditioning and transport. As these processes also generate environmental impacts, reuse might not always be preferred over new construction. This paper presents a method to design reticular structures with minimal environmental impact made from reused and new elements. The formulation given in this paper is based on a combination of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and discrete structural optimization. The LCA carried out in this work accounts for impacts generated from sourcing reclaimed elements to the assembly of the structure. Structural optimization is subject to stress constraints on element capacity and deflection limits for serviceability. Typical loading scenarios are considered. The method is applied to the design of three single-span steel trusses of different topology subject to 100 simulated stocks of reusable elements that have varying cross-sections and lengths. Benchmarks against minimum-weight solutions made solely from recycled steel show that this method produces structures with up to 56% lower environmental impact. Depending on stock availability, the lowest environmental impact is achieved through a combination of reused and new elements. © 2020","Environmental impact reduction; Life Cycle Assessment; Reuse; Structural optimization","Construction industry; Ecodesign; Integer programming; Life cycle; Structural optimization; Fabrication process; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Loadbearing structure; Material consumption; Mixed integer linear programming; Reuse; Structural elements; Varying cross section; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081167778

A sustainable and prefabricated composite structural system was developed in this study wherein the steel beam is attached to the prefabricated steel-bars truss concrete slab using the demountable bolted connectors. Twelve push-out specimens were designed and tested to assess the shear behavior of the bolted connectors. The test results showed that the shear bearing capacity of the bolted connectors with the prefabricated steel-bars truss concrete slab increased 7.0% over that of the bolted connectors with the prefabricated normal concrete slab. Three full-scale composite beams with various shear connection ratios were constructed and loaded to failure. For direct comparison, a similar composite beam was constructed with the same section size and shear connectors, but using the cast-in-place concrete slab.

This study proposes a methodology based on a chain of tools to enable structural engineers to anticipate future reuse. This methodology describes the design of reversible assemblies, the addition of complementary information in the building information modeling (BIM), reinforced traceability, and the development of a material bank. At the same time, controlling the environmental impacts of reuse is planned by carrying out a life cycle assessment (LCA) at all stages of the project. Two scenarios for reuse design are applied with the toolchain proposed. A. ""design from a stock"" scenario, which leads to 100% of elements being reused, using only elements from stock. B. ""design with a stock"" scenario, which seeks to integrate as many reused elements available in the stock as possible. The case study of a high-rise building deconstructed to rebuild a medium-rise building demonstrated that the developed toolchain allowed the inclusion of all reuse elements in a new structural calculation model. © 2020 by the authors.","Building circular economy; Building information modeling (BIM); Design for reuse; Embodied energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Reuse of materials; Sustainable construction","bearing capacity; building construction; database; design method; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; loading test; structural analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084547037

However, depending on their physicochemical properties (e.g., chemical structures), non-phenolic TrOCs appear to be resistant to laccase-catalysed degradation, thus requiring an additional treatment process. In this study, the performance of an integrated laccase and persulfate (PS) mediated oxidation process was explored and elucidated for the first time. Compared to that achieved during treatment with laccase alone, the addition of PS at 1-10 mM concentration into batch enzymatic bioreactors showed concentration-dependent improvement in the degradation of the five TrOCs selected, namely diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole, carbamazepine, bisphenol A and oxybenzone. The results obtained from a series of batch tests also confirmed that the structural components (e.g., carbohydrate moieties in the enzyme) as well as the possibility of PS acting as a final acceptor of electrons from the type II and type III active sites of laccase may have led to PS activation. A continuous treatment system was developed by integrating a nanofiltration (NF) membrane with the laccase/PS process (NF-MBRlaccase/PS), which achieved TrOC-specific degradation. Importantly, the degradation of non-phenolic TrOCs (diclofenac, sulfamethoxazole and carbamazepine) further improved by 10 to 65% in the NF-MBRlaccase/PS system. This improvement could be attributed to: (i) the prolonged contact time between laccase/PS and TrOCs, which was possible due to their complete retention by the NF membrane; and (ii) retention of oxidative cross coupling agents or secondary radicals enhancing TrOC degradation. The NF membrane not only retained the moderately degraded carbamazepine and sulfamethoxazole effectively but also effectively removed toxic transformation products and residual estrogenicity of the final effluent as evaluated by cytotoxicity and estrogenicity assays, respectively. These observations indicate the significance of the high retention membrane in the NF-MBRlaccase/PS system for producing high quality permeate suitable for disposal and potentially for water reuse applications. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry..",,"Amides; Biological water treatment; Catalysis; Coupling agents; Effluents; Physicochemical properties; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Additional treatment; Concentration-dependent; Continuous treatments; Oxidation process; Structural component; Sulfamethoxazole; Trace organic contaminants; Transformation products; Enzymes; catalyst; concentration (composition); degradation; membrane; oxidation; toxicity; trace element",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083110776

For crack sensing tags, however, the short service life of tags restricted their application. This paper aims to introduce a method of surface crack detection and monitoring based on RFID tag, which makes it possible for tags to be reused. Design/methodology/approach: Metal plate to be monitored, acting as the ground plane of microstrip patch antenna, is underneath the crack sensing tag. The propagating surface crack in metal plate will change the electric length of tag’s antenna that is directly proportional to the crack depth and length. Thus, the deformation of sensing tag introduced by the load on metal structure is no longer a prerequisite for crack sensing. Findings: The simulated and experimental results show that the proposed crack sensing tag can sense the change of surface crack with mm-resolution and sense surface crack propagation without a deformation, which means the proposed crack sensing tag can be reused. Originality/value: The key advantage of the proposed method is the reusability of the RFID tags. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Crack monitoring; Reusable crack sensor; RFID tag; Surface crack sensing","Computer software reusability; Crack propagation; Deformation; Metals; Microstrip antennas; Plate metal; Plates (structural components); Radio frequency identification (RFID); Reusability; Slot antennas; Surface defects; Crack monitoring; Crack sensors; Design/methodology/approach; Measurement equipment; Micro-strip patch antennas; RF-ID tags; Surface crack detection; Surface cracks; Crack detection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078979196

Studies in the field of selective disassembly are scarce and there is no evidence of established methodologies for the optimization of the environmental and financial benefits. A multi-objective analysis is key to obtaining several effective selective disassembly plans for the adaptive reuse of an existing asset through the combination of different deconstruction methods. The analysis is carried out in terms of the physical, environmental, and economic constraints of the deconstruction methods per building component. The Sequential Disassembly Planning for Buildings (SDPB) method is used in order to generate the optimized disassembly plans for retrieving target components. At the end, a weighted multi-objective optimization analysis is incorporated to generate the set of noninferior solutions that minimizes environmental impacts and building cost. The results show that different complete disassembly plans exist for all the possible combinations. The possible combinations are driven by the deconstruction methods per component, as well as the dismantling interdependence. The method described in this study can be used to improve the project outcomes according to specific goals and constraints (e.g. environmental, economic, technical). The results of this study improve the decision-making process for adaptive reuse building projects by adding comprehensive quantitative analysis towards sustainable management and conservation of resources. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive reuse; Building components reuse; Circular economy; Green design; Multi-objective optimization; Selective disassembly planning","Building components; Conservation; Construction industry; Decision making; Ecodesign; Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Historic preservation; Project management; Sustainable development; Adaptive re use; Circular economy; Decision making process; Deconstruction methods; Disassembly planning; Multi-objective analysis; Selective-disassembly; Sustainable management; Multiobjective optimization; architectural design; environmental economics; multiobjective programming; optimization; recycling; structural component; sustainable development; article; decision making; economic aspect; environmental impact; multiobjective optimization; quantitative analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075759267

The proposed connection system has several advantages such as rapid assembly and disassembly, reusability, and replaceability if damaged during an earthquake event. An experimental investigation was first carried out to determine the seismic performance of the proposed connections. In total, six full-scale precast and monolithic T-shape beam-column connection specimens with different reinforcement ratios, specimen dimensions and detailing were tested under displacement controlled cyclic loading, while the axial load on the column was kept constant. The cyclic behaviour, curvature distribution, failure mode, energy dissipation capacity and ductility of the specimens were obtained using the experimental outputs. Detailed non-linear finite element (FE) models were then developed using ABAQUS. It is shown that the FE models can accurately predict the overall performance of the precast connections in terms of initial stiffness, lateral load-bearing capacity and post-peak behaviour. The results indicate that, in general, the precast connections exhibited considerably higher (up to 34%) ductility and ultimate drift ratio (deformability) compared to similar monolithic connections. For the same drift ratio, monolithic connections exhibited slightly higher (on average 10%) energy dissipation capacity, while the precast connections generally dissipated higher energy at their ultimate point (post-peak lateral drift corresponding to 15% loss in lateral strength). It is demonstrated that the monolithic-like precast connections can satisfy the ACI 318-14 acceptance criteria, while they also sustain the ASCE 41-17 Collapse Prevention (CP) limits. Therefore, the proposed connection system is considered to be suitable for RC structures in seismic regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cyclic loading; Ductility; Monolithic-like connections; Precast concrete; Seismic performance","ABAQUS; Connectors (structural); Cyclic loads; Displacement control; Ductility; Energy dissipation; Reinforced concrete; Reusability; Seismic waves; Seismology; Analytical investigations; Curvature distributions; Energy dissipation capacities; Experimental investigations; Non-linear finite elements; Precast connections; Reinforcement ratios; Seismic Performance; Precast concrete; analytical framework; column; concrete structure; cyclic loading; ductility; earthquake engineering; experimental study; reinforced concrete; reinforcement; seismic design; seismic response; structural component",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076618031

However, it has many challenges with one of the most important being explainable AI; that is, providing human-understandable accounts of why a machine learning model produces specific outputs. To address this challenge, we propose superimposition as a concept which uses conceptual models to improve explainability by mapping the features that are important to a machine learning model’s decision outcomes to a conceptual model of an application domain. Superimposition is a design method for supplementing machine learning models with structural elements that are used by humans to reason about reality and generate explanations. To illustrate the potential of superimposition, we present the method and apply it to a churn prediction problem. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artificial intelligence; Conceptual modeling; Explainable AI; Human categorization; Machine learning; Superimposition","Computer software reusability; Decision making; Information management; Turing machines; Churn predictions; Conceptual model; Decision outcome; Design method; Machine learning models; Structural elements; Machine learning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098264372

Rapid urbanization renders it necessary to reduce the consumption of non-renewable natural resources drastically and also to limit the dumping of these materials after the expiration of their service life. In a rapidly progressing country like India, development of infrastructure produces a lot of solid waste. This derives the interest to reuse it by admixing or adding with existing soil to improve its strength properties. The concrete and brick content, which constitutes a major portion of CDW, is called as building derived material (BDM). The shear strength of soil partially replaced with BDM is a significant property that defines its suitability for several applications. However, it is not an intrinsic property and varies with several experimental factors such as relative density of soil and shearing strain at which shear tests are conducted. The present study deals with the behavior of BDM when admixed with locally available red soil tested at different strain rates (1.25 and 2 mm/min). Consolidated undrained triaxial tests are carried out at three different confining pressures (100, 150, and 200 kPa). This study further investigates the effect of the degree of compaction on the shear strength properties of soil–BDM blends. The results obtained from this study show that the addition of BDM to the soil is enhancing the resistance of the soil to deformation under axial load. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Building derived materials; Strain rates; Triaxial tests","Charge density waves; Demolition; Natural resources; Shear flow; Shear strength; Soil mechanics; Soil testing; Soils; Consolidated-undrained triaxial test; Construction and demolition waste; Degree of compaction; Different confining pressures; Experimental factors; Non-renewable natural resources; Rapid urbanizations; Structural elements; Strain rate",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096414335

The survey represents the first necessary moment for building’s knowledge investigation. Nowadays, the wide use of tools and accurate surveying techniques makes it possible to achieve an adequate level of accuracy of information related to the buildings; BIM tools offer a great potential, in terms of both planning and evaluation of the entire knowledge and conservation process of an historical building, and in terms of its management and future maintenance. In particular, the BIM technologies allow the communication between data coming from different software, allowing a greater exchange of information between many actors. In recent years, the generative process of Building Information Modelling (BIM) oriented to the digitization of built heritage has been supported by the development of new commands modelling able to integrate the output data produced by laser scanner surveys (point clouds) in major modelling applications. Structural elements, such as vaulted historical systems, arches, decorations, architectural ornaments and wall partitions with variable cross sections, require higher levels of detail (LOD) and information (LOI) compared to the digitalization process of new buildings. Therefore, the structure of a BIM model aimed at representing existing and historical artefacts (HBIM) requires the definition of a new digital process capable of converting traditional techniques used for the management of new buildings to those suitable for creation of digital versions of historical buildings that are unique of their kind.

The construction systems considered are reinforced concrete framing (RC), structural steel framing (SS) and cold-formed steel framing (CFS). The framework is developed in accordance with the relevant guidelines for life cycle analysis and sustainability and is intended to support decision making in the design stage. The system boundary for the study is from cradle-to-grave, including all cost components from construction stage, use stage and disposal stage in addition to possible recycling/reuse options. The developed framework integrates building information modeling, energy simulation modeling and end of life scenarios to calculate and compare life cycle costs and sustainability advantages of construction system alternatives. All future costs are discounted to their present value using the appropriate interest rates. Uncertainties in the input parameters are modeled using realistic probability distributions and then used in a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis to investigate the impact of changes in the input parameters on the result. Application of the developed system to a university building revealed the following results. The total life cycle cost is nearly the same for RC framing system and CFS framing system, while the life cycle cost of SS framing system is 13.4% more. When the system is credited for possible revenues resulting from early operation and recycling/reuse, the total life cycle cost of the RC framing system and the SS framing system become nearly the same while the life cycle cost of the CFS framing system becomes 22% less. Sensitivity analysis of the results shows that the discount rate has the most effect on the estimated mean cost followed by the inflation rate and the construction cost. The sustainability assessment focuses on calculating the LEED points associated with material recycling/reuse potentials and waste management. © 2019","Building construction systems; Building information modeling; Life cycle cost assessment; Monte Carlo simulation; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainability assessment","Architectural design; College buildings; Cost estimating; Decision making; Economic analysis; Information theory; Intelligent systems; Life cycle; Monte Carlo methods; Probability distributions; Recycling; Reinforced concrete; Sensitivity analysis; Steel construction; Structural design; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Waste management; Building construction; Building Information Model - BIM; Cold-formed steel framing; Commercial applications; Lifecycle costs; Structural steel framing; Sustainability assessment; Total life cycle costs; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072213061

Reusing structural elements reduces the environmental impacts of building structures because it avoids sourcing new material, it reduces waste and it requires little energy. Designing structures from reused elements is unlike conventional structural design because stock element availability is a design input. In other words, structures must be designed subject to availability of given element characteristics such as length and cross-section type, which have a major influence on the optimal structure layout and form. In this new paradigm structural form follows availability. In this work new computational methods for the synthesis of reticular structures through reuse are formulated to address two scenarios: a) reuse of reclaimed elements from a given stock, and b) design of an element stock which is used as a kit of parts to build diverse structures. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methods. It is shown that structures produced by these methods have a significantly lower environmental impact than minimum weight structures made of new elements.

In order to inform current design practices and provide information to partially evaluate if a steel member can be reused after its service life, construction-induced strains in a typical building were recorded. Specifically, two columns and three Beams of a four-story steel-framed building were instrumented prior to delivery to the construction site using a wireless sensor network. Data were recorded for 48 days, while the structure was erected and the concrete deck poured, up to fireproofing the building. The data were analyzed considering dead load force effects during various construction phases, impacts, and temperatures. The analysis revealed high variations in temperature throughout the structure and consequently significant temperature-induced stresses as well as greater magnitudes of flexural stress in columns than expected. As a result, the recorded stresses differed by 1-120 MPa (0-18 ksi) compared to the theoretically predicted stresses. Yet, the maximum measured stress [160 MPa (23.2 ksi)] was only 46% of the nominal yield strength. Measured stresses were also used to calculate member forces, and the combined member forces resulted in a maximum of 55% of the yield limit. Thus, the results validated current design practices and the possibility of reusing structural steel. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Buildings; Construction; Field data; Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED); Reuse; Steel; Wireless sensor networks","Architectural design; Building materials; Buildings; Construction; Fireproofing; Steel; Steel construction; Construction phasis; Field data; Leadership in energy and environmental designs; Nominal yield strength; Reuse; Steel framed buildings; Structural steel members; Temperature-induced; Wireless sensor networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072372241

Two types of fibrous materials, Saffil alumina and KCC cerakwool insulation materials, were selected. A sandwich specimen was invented to test the heat-shielding performance of the fibrous materials which were sandwiched by an Inconel plate and a titanium plate. The insulated sandwich structure was heated to 800°C for 2,000 seconds. The temperature profiles of the back side of the titanium plate were measured to compare the heat-shielding performance of the fibrous insulation materials. The microstructure of insulation materials, such as the fiber diameter, fiber orientation, and the parent materials of the fiber, was studied to understand how those characteristics influence the radiative properties of the fiber. The difference in microstructural parameters caused a difference in thermal resistance in the fibrous materials. The Saffil alumina insulation had a better performance than KCC cerakwool insulation because of its small fiber diameter and in-plane fiber orientation. The experimental results confirmed the heat transfer simulation results for fibrous materials done by other researchers. In addition, the reusability of high-temperature fibrous insulation, one of the important issues in real applications, was tested. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Fibers; Heat shielding; Heat transfer; High temperature applications; Insulating materials; Plates (structural components); Reusability; Sandwich structures; Titanium plating; Fibrous insulation; Heat transfer simulation; Insulation materials; Insulation system; Microstructural parameters; Radiative properties; Shielding performance; Temperature profiles; Insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048773888

Structural steel is highly compatible with this concept; however, when steel-concrete composite structures are used, recycling becomes difficult and the potential for reuse is lost. In order to make steel-concrete composite structures reusable, bolted connections should replace the commonly used welded headed studs. Furthermore, the reusable parts should be designed to withstand repeated use. This paper presents a desktop study and the corresponding laboratory experiments on demountable shear connectors that facilitate recyclability and even provide the potential for reusing complete structural elements. In the Laboratory of Steel and Composite Structures of the University of Luxembourg 15 push-out tests have been carried out using different bolted connection systems suitable for multiple use. The shear connectors have been evaluated based on their shear strength, stiffness, slip capacity, ductility and ability of demounting. The investigated systems included pre-stressed and epoxy resin injection bolts, solid slabs and solid slabs in combination with profiled steel sheeting. The results showed that the tested demountable shear connections could provide higher shear resistance than conventional shear connections. The critical failure mode was the shear failure of the bolts, which is a brittle failure. There was no visible damage observed on the connected members. The application of epoxy resin in the hole clearance resulted in lower slip capacity. The outcome provides an important basis for the justification of the forthcoming enhancement and validation of numerical models of the demountable shear connections. The failure behaviour, the observed damages and the resulting ability of the elements for re-use are discussed in detail. © 2019 Institution of Structural Engineers","Circular economy; Demountable shear connectors; Experimental study; Metal decking; Push-out tests; Shear capacity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066335214

Structural work and foundations represent the majority of the embodied energy of a building. The research effort is therefore focused on the structural elements. Reuse is here defined as the reuse of an element without transformation, unlike recycling which induces a new industrial cycle. It is therefore about reducing the consumption of materials and lowering GHG emissions. Today, it is impossible in France to reuse structures because of responsibilities, insurance and lack of traceability. How to make possible the reuse of structural components in order to reach a low carbon building? The challenge of this work is to find the best structural configuration making the components reuse easier at the EOL. The methodology we are implementing aims to design the structural elements by increasing the BIM parameters (6D, LCA), to attach the mechanical information, material durability, ageing to each object of the digital mock-up. A digital and physical traceability makes it possible to follow the evolution of the element over the years and to feed a database. At the end of its life the database is accessible and searchable for the design of a future building. A development of tools and gateways will then allow from a model of calculation to go to query the database to find an element resulting from the deconstruction that can be reused in the future structure. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This paper has proposed a novel intermediate fluid vaporizer by employing multi-stream plate-fin heat exchanger (MPFHE-IFV). Compared to traditional shell-and-tube IFVs, it can not only achieve a higher heat transfer efficiency with more compact structure using MPFHE but also realize the recovery and reuse of LNG cold energy with intermediate fluid. In this ingenious design, the self-evaporating gas of cryogenic liquid is adopted as the intermediate medium of IFV so that the equipment freezing can be effectively avoided under large flow conditions. A thermal-hydraulic design model has been established for MPFHE-IFV to determine the detailed structural dimensions as well as the heat transfer performance, and a corresponding multi-objective optimization algorithm has been adopted to obtain the minimum equipment volume, the optimal channel arrangement and fin structure, the maximum cold energy recovery efficiency and the optimal number of internal cycles. Meanwhile, the transmission process of the cryogenic exergy in MPFHE-IFV has been revealed according to the analysis of the system temperature-entropy diagram. Finally, two experimental cases based on the liquid nitrogen regasification process are conducted to evaluate the practical performance of the novel MPFHE-IFVs using the design and optimization method proposed in this paper. The results indicate that this new type of IFV can reach the highest cold energy recovery efficiency up to 95% within the 8% error range when the heat transfer capacity is 11.5 kW and the heat medium flow rate is near 330 L/h. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cold energy recovery; Intermediate fluid vaporizer; Multi-objective optimization; Multi-stream plate-fin heat exchanger; Thermal performance experiment","Cryogenic energy storage; Cryogenics; Fins (heat exchange); Heating equipment; Liquefied natural gas; Multiobjective optimization; Plates (structural components); Recovery; Structural design; Cold energy; Design and optimization; Heat transfer efficiency; Intermediate fluid vaporizer; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Plate-fin heat exchanger; Thermal Performance; Thermal-hydraulic designs; Heat transfer performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065085576

At present, the commonly used BIW lightweight technology around the world includes the application of high-strength lightweight material, the optimization of vehicle structure as well as application of new molding and connection technology. The optimization of vehicle structure changes the mechanical properties of the components by selecting shape parameters of the components (such as the geometric characteristics of the components), in order to achieve lightweight design or performance optimization design. Since BIW contains a large number of structural components and design variables, designing BIW is always time-consuming and knowledgeable-extensive, which requires the collaboration of multidisciplinary engineers.

As sustainability becomes more and more important in the construction industry, the design of composite beams must be adapted to meet the requirements of the circular economy. This calls for demountability and reusability of the structural components, as well as optimized use of materials, for example by using non-prismatic beams. Linear-elastic design and the (optimized) use of demountable shear connectors are key in the design of reusable composite structures. In this paper, analytical prediction models for the elastic behaviour and the first eigenfrequency of non-prismatic composite beams with non-uniform shear connector arrangements are derived. The approach is based on 6th and 2nd order differential equations used to define matrix equations for a finite number of linearized composite beam segments. The analytical models are validated using experimental and numerical results obtained with a simply supported tapered composite beam. The analytical models are suitable for comprehensive structural analysis of non-prismatic composite beams with non-uniform shear connection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical modelling; Composite beam; Eigenfrequency; Sustainability; Tapered beam","Analytical models; Composite beams and girders; Construction industry; Differential equations; Matrix algebra; Reusability; Sustainable development; Analytical predictions; Composite beam; Cross section designs; Design of composites; Eigenfrequency; Static and free vibration analysis; Steel concrete composite beam; Tapered beam; Vibration analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067198258

Then the residual mechanical properties of steel materials are important indexes to evaluate the postfire performance of the entire structure and the reuse of the steel members. Many studies have been performed to explore the postfire residual performance of different structural steels. However, the observed varying trends and proposed evaluation guidance are too specific and are different from each other. In this paper, existing postfire test data for hot-rolled steels and cold-formed steels are collected from an extensive literature survey. Statistical analyses on the effects of heating experience on the mechanical properties of steels are conducted. The influencing mechanisms are explained from the point of microstructure phase changes during and after the fire heating. The cold-formed steels exhibit a higher level of influence from the fire heating due to the release of cold-working dislocation. Two series of predictive models for postfire residual strength evaluation are calibrated, and they are highly universal and can be easily applied for the residual strength assessment of hot-rolled and cold-formed steels after a fire. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cold-formed steel; Hot-rolled steel; Postfire; Predictive equation; Residual factor","Building materials; Cold working; Fires; Hot rolling; Mechanical properties; Microalloyed steel; Structural design; Studs (structural members); Cold-formed steel; Elevated temperature; Influencing mechanisms; Post-fire; Predictive equations; Residual factors; Residual performance; Structural steels; Hot rolled steel",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064208076

It is hard to achieve parametric and automated design of the non-standard cam, which determines the quality and cost of die design.

A new design system for non-standard cams based on the feature reuse and group assembly technology was researched and developed in this paper for automotive panel dies. Taking the advantage of the well-organized historical knowledge base and features database of non-standard cam design cases and the seamless integration with the NX platform, the system was able to generate designs of the die substructure with cam in the form of assembly, including the driver, slider, stripper, cam base, and types of standard components such as nitrogen cylinders, guide plates, stopper seats, return hooks, safety pulling plates, and other parts.

There are number of studies that have been conducted on concrete with rubber as aggregate in order to maintain mechanical properties and durability of material. Contrary, only several studies have been conducted on usage of waste rubber tires as aggregate in reinforced concrete elements and systems. These review paper summaries and compare independent research works and justifies weather these aggregates are possible to utilize improved behavior of concrete elements or not. According to general conclusions on fundamental properties of rubberized elements it is evident that the waste rubber tire aggregates can be used as partial replacement of both coarse aggregates and fine aggregates. Previous research on structural elements shows that replacement of the natural aggregate with recycled tire aggregate in concrete, will produce structural elements with improved behavior: increased capacity for deformations (ductility), better dissipation of energy, and higher damping, in comparison with standard concrete made with conventional aggregates. However, the increased content of rubber in concrete also has negative effects, for example reduction of compressive and tensile as well as reduction of Young's modulus of elasticity. The results of these experimental studies are not sufficient to reach a general consensus on the application of recycled rubber in concrete and its effect on the behavior of structural elements. Inconsistency of the effects of recycled rubber in the concrete on the static and dynamic properties of reinforced-concrete structures indicate that there is uttered need for further research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregate; Concrete; Rubber; Structural elements","Aggregates; Concretes; Durability; Elastic moduli; Mechanical properties; Recycling; Reinforced concrete; Rubber; Tires; Wheels; Durability of materials; Fundamental properties; Independent research; Partial replacement; Reinforced concrete elements; Structural elements; Structural reinforced concrete; Sustainable construction; Concrete aggregates; aggregate; durability; mechanical property; reinforced concrete; rubber",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063109660

Still little explored, the reuse of structural components over multiple service lives has the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of building structures. Structural design and construction based on reuse avoids sourcing new material, it reduces superfluous waste, and requires little energy. However, designing a structure from a stock of reclaimed elements entails a change of design paradigm: in contrast to conventional design practice, the structural geometry and topology depends on element stock characteristics, e.g. available cross sections and lengths. This paper presents discrete structural optimization formulations to design truss systems from stock elements. The approach taken in this work is iterative: 1) element assignment and topology optimization are carried out, and 2) geometry optimization follows thereafter to best-fit the system geometry to the length of assigned stock elements, for instance to reduce cut-off waste. Two case studies are presented: a) a cantilever of simple layout used to explain the details of the design methodology, and b) a train station roof structure of complex layout made from elements reused from disassembled electric pylons. For these case studies, Life Cycle Assessment confirms that an up to 63% environmental impact reduction is possible when comparing structures obtained with the proposed method against weight-optimized solutions made of new elements. © 2018 The Authors","Circular economy; Life-Cycle Assessment; Reuse; Structural optimization; Truss structures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058780620

The Metropole Region of Amsterdam (MRA) is a pioneer in this field, initiating a research for circular rebuilding of a neighbourhood in 2016 and the development of a roadmap for circular urban development in 2017. This year, the port of Amsterdam and the municipalities of Amsterdam and Haarlemmermeer together commissioned the analysis of the effects of circular construction on material flows, transport movements in the MRA, and land use in the harbour area. These effects were analysed by means of a building material model (BOB), combined with logistic models and construction and demolition forecasts of the Economic Institute for Construction and Housing (EIB). The results showed a mismatch between the supply of secondary building materials and the construction demand, ranging from factor 7 (more demand than supply) in the coming years to a factor 4 in the period 2041-2050. An evaluation of circular construction concepts revealed high potential for the reuse of structural elements, leading to a 20% decrease of material need for new buildings, 21% less transport kilometres and 20% less land use. The concept of demountable constructions was calculated to have no impact on total material use between 2018-2050, while increasing the transport kilometres and land use. Several concrete recommendations were given, for example on the interaction between logistics and land use and need for a more in-depth comparison of a variety of circular strategies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Buildings; Concretes; Land use; Ports and harbors; Urban growth; Circular strategies; Construction and demolition; Construction demands; High potential; Logistic models; Material Flow; Structural elements; Urban development; Construction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063391404

Still, they contribute the most to the material weight and embodied impacts of buildings and infrastructures. The reuse of structural components therefore offers great potential to save materials, energy and resources. While historic and contemporary projects highlight the environmental, time or cost benefits of building with reclaimed elements, many technological challenges remain. This paper gives an overview of buildings that efficiently reuse structural components as well as a review of current research efforts addressing structural reuse. The first case study is the design process of an elastic gridshell made from reclaimed skis. This project demonstrates the potential of ensuring structural performance while working with uncharacterized and heterogeneous materials. In general, designing structures from a stock of reclaimed elements entails reversing the conventional structural design process. The synthesis of structures has to follow the availability of elements and their mechanical and geometric properties. Developed tools that facilitate such design from reused elements while minimizing embodied environmental impacts are presented in this paper. A second case study demonstrates the relevance of such tools through a conceptual train station roof made from electric pylon elements. Lastly, some key challenges related to the design of structural systems from reused elements are presented. These research initiatives constitute a first step to understand and support the design of load-bearing systems from reused elements and hence to bring the construction industry closer to circular economy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Availability; Buildings; Construction industry; Electric tools; Environmental impact; Inflatable structures; Obsolescence; Reclamation; Embodied environmental impact; Geometric properties; Heterogeneous materials; Load-bearing components; Research initiatives; Structural component; Structural performance; Technological challenges; Structural analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063378919

Traditionally, composite beams are cast in-situ and shear interaction between the concrete and steel beam is provided by welded headed studs. The application of welded headed studs prevents the non-destructive separation of the composite beam, which leads to a very low scoring in the sustainable assessment in terms of the reuse of structural components. An alternative to welded headed studs are bolted shear connectors, which allow for demountability and reusability of a (prefabricated) composite floor system. A key challenge for demountable and reusable composite beams consisting of prefabricated elements is to provide sufficient tolerances to allow for easy execution and demounting, but also to achieve a stiff and strong shear connection under live loads. The required tolerances can, for instance, be obtained by using large bolt-to-hole clearances. The, at first glance, contradictory requirement of a large hole clearance in the execution phase and high stiffness under live loading conditions was solved by using injection bolts. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the demountable and composite structures fit in the circular economy framework, and to show that such a demountable and reusable structure was successfully erected and demounted under laboratory conditions. In addition, a cost assessment will be addressed using a simple methodology based on estimated service life (ESL) factors to estimate the annual environmental costs of a composite floor system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bolts; Composite beams and girders; Computer software reusability; Concretes; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Fits and tolerances; Floors; Reusability; Steel beams and girders; Studs (structural members); Tall buildings; Welding; Composite floor systems; Design of composites; Environmental costs; Laboratory conditions; Multi-storey car park; Prefabricated elements; Structural component; Sustainable assessment; Studs (fasteners)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063368363

The first type promotes the end-of-life scenario of disassembly and reuse of structural elements, while the conventional systems are related to the current practices of waste management for building materials, i.e. demolition and recycling. To analyse these different structural systems and relative scenarios, a comparative Life Cycle Assessment investigating two entire life cycles of the materials is developed.

Reusing structural elements reduces the environmental impacts of building structures because it avoids sourcing new material, it reduces waste and it requires little energy. Designing structures from reused elements is unlike conventional structural design because stock element availability is a design input. In other words, structures must be designed to fit given element characteristics, e.g. cross-sections and lengths. Stock constraints such as number of elements and element lengths, have a major influence on the optimal structure layout and form. In this new paradigm structural form follows availability. This work formulates new computational methods for the synthesis of reticular structures through reuse. Two scenarios are presented: a) reuse of reclaimed elements from a given stock, and b) design of a common stock which is used as a kit-of-parts to build diverse structures. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the potential of the proposed methods. It is shown that structures produced by these methods have a significantly lower environmental impact than minimum weight structures made of new elements. Copyright © 2019 by S: GABRIELE, F.

A substantial share of these impacts is contributed by load-bearing systems because of their mass-and energy-intensive production process. Therefore, reusing structural components over multiple service lives has the potential to improve the sustainability of building structures. However, reusing structural elements entails reversing the conventional structural design process: the mechanical and geometric properties of available elements predetermine the geometry and topology of a structure. This paper presents structural optimization techniques: 1) for the design of multiple spatial structures from one stock of elements, and 2) for the synthesis of an optimal stock or kit-of-parts whose elements can be used in multiple structures. The objective of case 1) is to avoid the cutting of stock elements, i.e. to reduce waste. In case 2), the objective is to reuse stock elements in as many structures as possible. In both cases, the assignment of stock elements to the structure is obtained via combinatorial optimization. In addition, geometry optimization is employed to best-fit the structure geometry to the lengths of assigned stock elements. The potential of the proposed methods for large-scale applications is demonstrated via case studies of three spatial structures of complex layout: a dome, two three-chord trusses and a tower. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Architecture; Combinatorial optimization; Energy utilization; Geometry; Structural design; Building construction; Geometric properties; Geometry optimization; Large-scale applications; Load-bearing systems; Multiple structures; Structural component; Structural elements; Structural optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086170165

The fabrication boundaries of the material are constantly stretching: visible metal connections are minimized and glass surfaces are maximized, resulting to pure all-glass structures. Still, due to the prevalence of the float glass industry, all-glass structures are currently confined to the limited forms and shapes that can be generated by planar, 2D glass elements. Moreover, despite the fact that glass is fully recyclable, most of the glass currently employed in buildings is neither reused nor recycled due to its perplexed disassembly and its contamination from coatings and adhesives. Cast glass can be the answer to the above restraints, as it can escape the design limitations generated from the 2-dimensional nature of float glass. By pouring molten glass into moulds, solid 3-dimensional glass components can be attained of considerably larger cross-sections and of virtually any shape. These monolithic glass objects can form repetitive units for large all glass-structures that do not buckle due to slender proportions and thus can take full advantage of the stated compressive strength of glass. Such components can be accordingly shaped to interlock towards easily assembled structures that do not require the use of adhesives for further bonding. In addition, cast glass units–due to their increased cross section– can tolerate a higher degree of impurities and thus can be produced by using waste glass as a raw source. © 2019, TU Delft Open.

Finally, protect the lives of not only human beings but also flora and fauna on this mother earth from their extinction [1]. This phenomenon has followed in two diverging fields described here. A significant problem in finning industry is the generation of aluminium scrap powder, contaminated with coolant which has necessarily used to keep the working tool (machinery) and work-piece (fin tube) at room temperature. In this manufacturing process of fin - tubes, a large quantity of aluminium scrap has generated in the form of paste. This heavily contaminated with the coolant and atmosphere; hence, it is heavy and not supports for recirculation, it has to throw away, which adds up to the cost of the final product as a result. Leads to loss of virgin metal and coolant, which otherwise could have reused for making products of aluminium and composites, moreover for recycling the coolant to repeated time hence thus derive more benefits both economically and environmentally. We have undertaken to salvage aluminium scrap and coolant for reuse. For this purpose, we have fabricated a vibrating tank, using all locally available materials and parts, which has provided with six filter cells and fixed firmly on the base plate of the tank. With this mechanical vibrator, we have successfully separated coolant up to 80% from the initially contaminated aluminium sludge in a most eco-friendly process. Thus saving both Al-scrap (powder) and coolant from being thrown away as a ''wastage”, as both ingredients -coolant could be reused up to defined time in the finning process, and the sediment Al-powder could be used to make a variety of lightweight structural components for many applications including automobile and aerospace-vehicles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, current commercialized spheroid culture tools have the shortcomings of high cost or relatively poor spheroid-forming results for some special cells. To solve such problems, we designed a 3D printed, reusable, stamp-like resin mold that could shape microstructures for spheroid culture of tumor cells on the surface of agarose substrate in a 96-well plate. We applied this homemade three-dimensional culture tool in spheroid formation for hepatocellular carcinoma cells. The experimental data show that the effect of spheroid culture on four hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines in our homemade spheroid culture plate is better than that of the commercialized ultralow attachment spheroid culture plate, and compared to two-dimensional culture, three-dimensional culture improves cell functions. In addition, the drug-sensitive test based on patient-derived hepatocellular carcinoma cells showed a different pattern between spheroid and two-dimensional cultures. In conclusion, our spheroid culture tool is characterized by its low cost, reusability, low cell consumption, convenience in medium exchange, and good effect of spheroid formation, suggesting that this technique could be widely used in individual treatment and high-throughput drug screening. © The Author(s) 2019.","3D culture; agarose; drug screening; primary hepatocarcinoma cells; spheroids","3D printers; Cell culture; Costs; Diagnosis; Plates (structural components); Reusability; Tumors; 3-d cultures; Agarose; Culture plates; Drug-screening; Hepatocarcinoma; Hepatocellular carcinoma cell; High-throughput; Primary hepatocarcinoma cell; Spheroid; Three-dimensional culture; Cells; albumin; alpha fetoprotein; breast cancer resistance protein; cisplatin; cytochrome P450 2C9; cytochrome P450 3A4; cytokeratin 18; doxorubicin; fluorouracil; gemcitabine; glucuronosyltransferase 1A1; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; hepatitis B surface antigen; oxaliplatin; phalloidin; aged; Article; cancer cell culture; cell function; cell proliferation assay; cell viability assay; clinical article; controlled study; drug metabolism; drug sensitivity; female; fluorescence imaging; gene expression; high throughput screening; human; human cell; human tissue; IC50; immunofluorescence microscopy; immunohistochemistry; liver cell carcinoma; male; maximum plasma concentration; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA isolation; three dimensional imaging; three dimensional printing; tumor spheroid; two-dimensional imaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076230629

Over 95% are thought to be of wood-frame or masonry and wood construction. Most of this building stock was constructed using wood sourced from old-growth forests across the eastern seaboard. The city now sits on a stockpile of wood which germinated before New Amsterdam became New York, and which was felled while signatories of the Declaration of Independence were still President; this is structurally valuable hard, dense and high strength-to-weight ratio wood. As our buildings degrade and require renovation or replacement the city must ensure that this resource is not wasted, for environmental and economic reasons. The total number of buildings is large, but because of the rapid and repetitive way that NYC was constructed the variation in building type and structural element sizes across the building population is small. Cross referencing NYC department databases using geographic information systems allowed the Department of Buildings to produce an estimate of the number of buildings in the city of each type. Assessment of historic pattern books, prescriptive regulations, and inspection of existing buildings allows generic estimates of wood dimension and quantity per building type. Combined, this data allows the estimation of the annual rate of release of wood from demolition in NYC - a predicted supply available for future use. A review of existing practices in wood salvage, processing and reuse is then assessed in context, outlining proposals for future local policy and research work. © 20th Congress of IABSE, New York City 2019: The Evolving Metropolis - Report.

For example, within almost every major city in the world, there are upscale enclaves centered around the adaptive reuse of factories and warehouses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These former industrial structures are almost always constructed from masonry and mass timber. Within the past decade, the building industry has seen a renewed interest in mass timber structures. This resurgence has been fueled by several trends, including the mass production of Cross Laminated Timber (CLT) and a growing awareness of mass timber's sustainable advantages. A number of high-profile heavy timber structures have found commercial success in the United States and abroad. Leading architectural practices such as Skidmore Owings & Merrill (SOM) have used research initiatives like the Timber Tower Research Project to jump-start a fertile debate within the design industry. On the demand side, building owners have pushed the design community to find innovative ways to incorporate mass timber into their projects. This interest has often driven designers and builders to aggressively distinguish their projects from predecessors, pushing for pure mass timber structures while giving less consideration to hybrid structures (mass timber and masonry/concrete structures). This bias towards material purity risks ignoring important lessons from the past and may in some cases lead to inefficient structural choices and structures with less durability and sustainability than their hypothetical hybrid counterparts. This paper posits that some of the energy generated by a resurgence in mass timber construction would be well spent on understanding, celebrating, and rediscovering the elegance and importance of hybrid structures. © 20th Congress of IABSE, New York City 2019: The Evolving Metropolis - Report.

The exploitation of heritage, nevertheless, is a wedge issue, as it involves new loads, more wear, different environmental conditions, which can induce changes in their behaviour which are hard to foresee. This contribution aims to analyse in particular the structural issues involved in the use changes or in the adaptation of a pre-existing use to new functional or normative requirements. Indeed, for a correct management of the built heritage, the choice of the structurally compatible uses cannot disregard a specific analysis aimed at the identification of the structure bearing capacity and focusing on the indications to combine functional and structural needs. The proposed case study, on which the approach is applied, regards the Pilotta National Museum, in Parma, that is undergoing a reorganization of the visit paths and a reconsideration on the uses allocated to some spaces. More specifically, a vaulted room over a long barrel vault is asked to host new functions and carry new loads, whose compatibility with the preservation of the monumental structure must be assessed. For the assessment of the structural compatibility levels, different modelling approaches have been tested, in order to compare their results and to analyze their pros and cons in this type of evaluation. On one side, traditional methods were chosen: the graphic Méry method and the Heyman limit analysis have been applied to a system of 2D arches composing the vault. On the other side, the edge cutting ChronoEngine Distinct Element Model have been also tested, under the same conditions. In all cases, calculations have been made changing both values and positions of the loads, depending on the requests for the new use of the vault. The results are compared both in terms of stresses inside the masonry and in terms of deformation of the structural elements, evaluating the types of information and detail that the different approaches can supply. The results of the numerical method allow to assess the validity of the traditional approaches. On the other side, the possible contribution of the traditional methods to the calibration of the parameters for the numerical models is also discussed. The results, at last, will be adopted to propose limitations to the possible uses and to give specific indications about the setting up of the museum exhibitions. © 2019 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Compatible reuse; Discrete element method; Graphic analysis; Masonry; Vault","Exhibitions; Finite difference method; Glass ceramics; Mechanics; Museums; Numerical methods; Structural analysis; Compatible reuse; Distinct element modeling; Environmental conditions; Graphic analysis; Masonry; Structural compatibility; Traditional approaches; Vault; Masonry materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072909871

Although it is obvious that the construction industry has been crucial for realizing building and civil infrastructures, it is also clear that building activities have a big impact on the environment. Still growing and developing societies and economies do need even more buildings, more roads etc. The question is how all these needs can be accomplished without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs (Brundtland Report). In this contribution the urgency of a sustainable construction industry is explained. The need for a change from building in the service of growth to building in the service of sustainability is emphasized. Comprehensive models, with which the entire building cycle can be simulated, would enable engineers to analyse the building and construction process with respect to the demand for raw materials and energy, maintenance and repair, renovation and retrofitting and, finally, recycling and reuse of materials and/or structural components. The option of developing a serious game for sustainable construction is discussed and recommended. With such a game the whole building cycle is simulated, ranging from decision making by stakeholders to execution on the site, curing, maintenance and repair in the service life phase, decommissioning, recycling and reuse. © 2019 Delft University of Technology.

Excessive amounts of construction and demolition (C&D) materials have gone to landfill every year and therefore it is necessary to recycle and reuse to reduce the carbon footprint generated throughout the world. A great way to reuse these materials is to put into operation for new construction projects. Although several recycled materials have been used recently in construction industry, little knowledge and research has been undertaken on RCR, which is generated from construction and housing industries. The RCR has previously been used as a structural element of highway pavements and has shown positive results, where very limited and undefined parameters are available. Laboratory test includes sieve analysis, California bearing ratio (CBR), compaction, Atterberg limit and Repeated Load Triaxial (RLT) tests were carried out on specimens sourced locally in Victoria. This research also investigates the resilient moduli (MR) and permanent deformation characteristics of RCR using RLT equipment to gain a thorough and definite understanding of how the material reacts under cyclic loading due to heavy and continuous cyclic loads on the railway track. A finite element modelling was also developed using laboratory experimental results to compare the permanent deformation obtained from the laboratory and numerical modelling.

Despite the two main steel connection methods, welding and bolting, being slow and/or expensive field activities, a new universally applicable, structural steel connection mechanism has not been introduced in more than a century, regardless of the new manufacturing capabilities available. It is clear that by improving and refining these features of multi-storey steel buildings, considerable savings in both weight and cost could be achieved. To achieve these savings, improved construction efficiency and heightened material reuse, a new class of interlocking steel connections using computer-controlled, advanced manufacturing techniques in laser cutting has been developed that rely on neither bolting nor welding. This paper presents the experimental testing and numerical modelling of the flange of the new interlocking steel connection in direct tension. A series of experimental tests were performed to capture the behaviour and failure modes of the new steel connection under tension. A simplified two-dimensional (2D) finite element (FE) model has been created using the ABAQUS software. The connection model accounts for material and geometric non-linearity, large deformation and contact behaviour. Contact is critical to model the tensile behaviour of the joint and was modelled using a surface to surface contact interaction taking into consideration friction between the surfaces. The model has been analysed through the elastic and plastic ranges up to failure and predicts the failure mode of the connection well. The comparison with the experimental data shows that the 2D model has a very good level of accuracy and the highest effectiveness in terms of computational time and memory usage. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","ABAQUS; Advanced manufacturing techniques; Contact; Experimental testing; Finite element modelling; Interlocking steel connection","ABAQUS; Building materials; Contacts (fluid mechanics); Engineering education; Life cycle; Manufacture; Microalloyed steel; Safety engineering; Steel testing; Urban transportation; Welding; Advanced manufacturing; Computational time and memory; Construction efficiency; Experimental testing; Finite element modelling; Manufacturing capability; Steel connections; Surface-to-surface contacts; Finite element method",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063948418

The residual capacity has been probabilistically evaluated in order to check the efficiency of the most vulnerable members of the structures and investigate systems’ robustness in case of sudden failure of the critical components. The method proposed can be considered as a reliable approach to recognise which structural element is most like to fail, and schedule proper selective maintenance interventions. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,"Roof coverings; Trusses; Intervention strategy; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Long span roof structure; Military construction; Military installations; Selective maintenance; Steel truss members; Structural elements; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063948178

Therefore, the development of techniques for the collection and recovery of the large amount of oil from water is attracting worldwide attention. To deal with the polluted water by spilled oil, materials with special wettability have been designed and developed over the past decades. Currently, metal meshes, sponges and cotton fabrics as well as particles with superhydrophobicity/superoleophiliciy or superhydrophiliciy/superoleophobicity have often been employed to separate oil and water mixtures. However, how to remove the spilled oil from water via techniques of low operation cost, high separation selectivity and efficiency as well as good recoverability for reuse without causing secondary contamination to environment is still a big challenge. Consequently, it is highly desirable to develop a new and advanced oil-water mixtures separation material that can selectively absorb oil while completely repelling water. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer, which is mainly used as a raw material to produce paper and cotton fabrics. Plant-derived cellulose is an important structural component of the primary cell wall of green plants, and usually found in a mixture with hemicellulose, lignin, pectin and other substances. Corn is a very common crop and widely planted in the Zhangye district of Gansu Province in China, and the corn straw are very abundant after harvest in autumn. However, the unused and accumulated corn straw can be easily rotted and hence cause the waste of resources, and the traditional treatment of burning can also induce serious environment pollution. With the consideration of the wide source, low cost, light weight, high oil adsorption capacity, good floatability in water as well as easy recycling, the corn straw is an ideal raw material which can be employed to prepare oil sorbent. In this research, corn straw was employed to fabricate oil sorbent. Corn straw was first crushed and then immersed into ZnO sol for 24 h, subsequently, corn straw powders were taken out and dried in air at 80℃. Finally, the dip-coated corn straw powders were immersed in octyltrimethoxy silane (OTS) solution for 24 h, taken out and dried at 120℃, and then, the corn straw powders begun to exhibit superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity. Water contact angle on the superhydrophobic corn straw powders is 158.6° and the sliding angle of water droplet is about 4°, but the oil droplets can spread out completely on the corn straw powders due to the superoleophilicity. Synergy effects between surface morphology and surface chemical composition are known as the crucial factors to realize the opposite wettability to oil and water. The surface morphology and surface chemical composition of the obtained corn straw powders with superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS), respectively, and the wettability were measured with an optical contact angle meter at ambient temperature. The research indicates that both the dip-coating ZnO sol and surface modification with OTS play an important role for the performance of superhydrophobicity and superoleophilicity of corn straw powders. Because water and many oils are intrinsically immiscible, and the corn straw powders with extremely different affinities towards oils and water can be employed to separate oil-water mixtures by ways of filtration, and the separation efficiency towards water and oil is up to 99.6% and 98.0%. In addition, the spilled oil on water can also be removed by adsorption. Compared with the adsorption capacity of the pristine corn straw powder to spilled oil, the adsorption capacity of superhydrophobic corn straw powder is much high, and the corresponding adsorption capacity is 2.1 and 3.8 g/g, respectively. Moreover, the corn straw and spilled oil adsorbed by superhydrophobic corn straw can be reused and recovered by treatment of high speed centrifugation. When the adsorption time increased from 1 to 10, the water contact angle on the recovered corn straw powders is still about 156°±1°, and the corresponding sliding angle of water is about 8°, and the average percentage of recovery of superhydrophobic corn straw to hexadecane is above 70%. The design and fabrication of oil sorbent of superhydrophobic-superoleophilic corn straw made by dip-coating ZnO sol and modifying with OTS are expected to provide a new idea for the processing and utilization of corn straw as well as preparation of oil sorbents. © 2019, Science Press.

The materials considered were carbon fiber reinforced epoxy and carbon fiber reinforced PEEK (polyetheretherketone). The manufacturing techniques compared were the autoclave, resin transfer molding (RTM) and cold diaphragm forming (CDF). The recycling scenarios included mechanical recycling and pyrolysis. For this purpose, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) models were developed and implemented for the case of a helicopter's canopy production. The results of the study pointed out that producing the canopy by using carbon fiber reinforced thermosetting composites and involving RTM as the manufacturing process is the optimal route both in terms of environmental and financial efficiency. The environmental and financial efficiency of the scenarios including thermoplastic composites as the material of choice is impaired from both the high embodied energy and raw material cost of PEEK. The scenarios investigated do not account for potential benefits arising from the recyclability and the improved reusability of thermoplastic matrices as compared to thermosetting ones. This underlines the need for a holistic aircraft structural optimization approach including not only performance and weight but also cost and environmental criteria. © 2019 by the authors.","Aeronautic component; Autoclave; Cold diaphragm forming; Composite materials; Cost analysis; Life cycle analysis; Resin transfer molding",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060440860

Since concrete waste is one of the biggest waste streams in the sector and in the world, reusing it would largely contribute to solve this problem. Various strategies have been followed and this kind of waste has been mostly used in road pavements activities. However, it has been proved that it is possible to use this waste for current concrete structural elements. This investigation proved that it is also possible to produce high-performance concrete made of both fine and coarse recycled concrete aggregates. It was even possible to produce a type of high-performance concrete made with total replacement of natural aggregates. However, present legislation, in the world in general and in Portugal in particular, does not allow this level of replacement ratio, particularly for fine recycled aggregates. In fact, most of the legislation around the world do not allow to use fine recycled aggregates in high-performance concrete. In this work, a simple specification proposal is presented to incorporate both fine and coarse aggregates to produce high-performance concrete. It was the result of a wide experimental campaign constituted of 3,049 laboratory tests. This specification defines the types of cement mix and the maximum replacement ratios that should be respected to produce five classes of high-performance concrete. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Construction and demolition waste (CDW); Fine and coarse aggregates; High-performance concrete; Legislation; Recycled concrete aggregates; Sustainability","Aggregates; Concrete aggregates; Construction industry; Demolition; Law enforcement; Laws and legislation; Recycling; Specifications; Sustainable development; Coarse aggregates; Coarse recycled concrete aggregate; Construction and demolition waste; Experimental campaign; Fine recycled aggregate; High Performance Recycled; Recycled concrete aggregates; Technical specifications; High performance concrete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054139588

The external dimensions of the proposed devices are optimized based on vehicle wheelpath distribution, tire trace patterns, and vehicle roller compaction conditions. The array pattern of the piezoelectric device is designed based on the driving characteristics. Various device material configurations are examined using different cover plates, rubber pad thicknesses, protective pads, and transducer specifications for optimal mechanic-electric response characteristics. A 150 mm × 150 mm type device is tested as an example and its electrical output performance is evaluated under typical road loading environments. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of various disclosed piezoelectric harvesting device technology were conducted and further research plan was developed. The selected modified polypropylene or aluminum plate, steel plate, modified polypropylene bar, and fiber heat insulation plate are suitable for the device which meets the application demands. The optimum device dimensions under light and heavy traffic conditions are 100 mm × 100 mm and 150 mm × 150 mm, respectively. The optimum configuration of the device includes a modified polypropylene upper cover plate, 1 mm rubber pad, ball-type protective pad, and eight laminated transducers. In addition, parallel connection of stacked transducers is more suitable for energy collection and reuse from traffic-induced pavement vibrations. Under the loading of 0.7 MPa and 15 Hz, the 150 mm × 150 mm device with nine parallel transducers achieves a maximum output power of 50.41 mW, and the corresponding optimum loading is 4 kΩ. Under the loading of 0.2 MPa and 10 Hz, the device achieves a maximum output power of 2.92 mW, and the corresponding optimum load is 10 kΩ.

Therefore, in order to develop technologies for the reuse of electroerosive powders and to evaluate the effectiveness of their use, complex theoretical and experimental studies are required. The purpose of this work is the study of the porosity of additive products from electroerosive cobalt-chrome powders. For the implementation of the planned studies, wastes of the cobalt-chrome alloy of the brand KHMS ""CELLIT"" were chosen. As a working fluid, butanol (butanol-1) was used. For the production of cobalt-chrome powders, a unit for EED of conductive materials was used. Dispersion parameters: voltage 100 V, capacity 48 μF, repetition rate 120 Hz. Therefore, two or more pores because of the absence on the thin section of the visible boundary of their division can be fixed as one large. In addition, the method gives the distribution of pores in one plane of the sample, where narrow and wide sections of the sample fall, while in the hydrostatic weighing method and mercury porosimetry the pore sizes are fixed at their narrowest cross section. A consequence of these factors is the displacement of the function and distribution in the region of large pores. The porosity was determined using an Olympus GX51 optical inverted microscope with software for quantitative image analysis. Prepared samples had no traces of grinding, polishing or dying of structural components. Based on the results of conducted studies of the porosity of additive products from electroerosive cobalt-chrome powders, it has been experimentally established that the porosity does not exceed 1,06%. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.",,"Cobalt alloys; Conductive materials; Distribution functions; Manufacture; Pore size; Additive technology; Dispersion parameters; Hydrostatic weighing; Initial composition; Mercury porosimetry; Quantitative image analysis; Scientific and technical literatures; Structural component; Powder metals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056632925

They are durable, adaptable, have light weight, ‘low cost’ and ease of stacking, taking many forms such as sculpture, homes, housing, hotels, however, most of their remittances are related to temporary housing needs, such as emergency shelters and mobile shelters. Repurposing cargo containers into structures is a reasonable sustainable practice because of most of the structure originating from reused materials, They have a smaller carbon footprint and create less landfill, also their environmental impact is low in comparison to traditional buildings made with brick and reinforced concrete structure, they require a short time to be erected with an advantage of mobility in case of future extension or moving these structures to different areas or including additional areas or volumes. The standards dimensions of ISO shipping containers make them excellent modular units which have the auxiliary capacity and plan parameters to create standard settlement units in an assortment of ways, it is a complete standard accommodation with its intrinsic quality, waterproof nature and availability, making it an exemplary structural component. Although shipping containers could be one of the solutions of emergency and mobile shelters and not the optimum one, it has less appeal than other building materials which require some adaptation to meet human and user needs and fit in with the context. Shipping containers could be also responsive on community level and provide temporary solutions to a particular shortage. This paper aims to provide an adapting of shipping containers as sustainable, green and recycled solution not only as Architecture but also as collecting and gathering units on site. As an effective study, the paper will examine the adaptation of shipping containers in various international projects in order to highlight the possibility of using Containers architecture in temporary accommodation shelters. This paper therefore, will introduce a new approach of reusing shipping containers as shelters solutions not in a matter of spaces as much as attention to human and community needs within a framework of urban compatibility.

This is because RFID can stimulate the reuse of construction components and reduce their wastage, hence addressing sustainability issues in the construction sector. To test the plausibility of that idea, this study explores the potential pre-conditions for RFID to facilitate construction components reuse, and develops a guidance for promoting their redistribution back to the supply chain. It also looks at how integrating RFID with Building Information Modelling (BIM) can possibly be a valuable extension of its capabilities, providing the opportunity for tracked components to be incorporated into new structures in an informed, sound way. A preliminary assessment of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the RFID technology is presented in order to depict its current and future potential in promoting construction components’ sustainable lifecycle management, while emphasis has been laid on capturing their technical, environmental, economic and social value. Findings suggest that the collection of the right amount of information at the design-construction-deconstruction-reuse-disposal stage is crucial for RFID to become a successful innovation in the construction sector. Although a number of limitations related to the technical operability and recycling of RFID tags seem to currently hinder its uptake for structural components’ lifecycle management, future technological innovations could provide solutions that would enable it to become a mainstream practice. Taken together these proposals advocate that the use of RFID and its integration with BIM can create the right environment for the development of new business models focused on sustainable resource management. These models may then unlock multiple values that are otherwise dissipated in the system. If the rapid technological development of RFID capability can be allied to policy interventions that control and manage its uptake along the supply chain, the sustainable lifecycle management of construction components could be radically enhanced. © 2017 The Authors","Construction and demolition waste (CDW); Information flow; Lifecycle valuation; Reuse; RFID; Structural components","business; innovation; modeling; resource management; sustainability; technological development; human; model; radiofrequency identification; recycling; resource management; sound; commercial phenomena; recycling; technology; Commerce; Recycling; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018410524

Mechanical and physical properties of these reversible adhesives were experimentally assessed in the work. The modified adhesives, coupled with electromagnetic induction, are able to guarantee separation of the joints without any damage to the substrates for recycling, reuse or repairing of components. Single lap joint specimens were prepared using epoxy/glass fibres substrates and tests were carried out on neat and modified adhesive with 5% weight of iron and iron oxide. Three different Fe particles size were tested: 450 µm, 60 µm and 1–6 µm. The particles size of iron oxide was 50 nm. Separation was studied using single lap joint specimens under electro-magnetic induction. Experimental results showed that the maximum peak load decreases when the average particles sizes increase. The peak loads of the smallest particles were equal to the ones of the pristine adhesive. The elongation of the adhesives increases when the adhesive is modified with both iron and iron oxide particles. Finally, experimental tests on single lap joints coupled with electro-magnetic induction showed that separation of the substrates is possible using iron oxide particles. Electro-magnetic tests conducted on particles alone, helped to understand that bigger particles are able to overcome the melting temperature of the adhesive but hot-melt adhesives modified with these particles are not able to reach the melting. These tests showed that the number of particles into the adhesive matrix is very important for this kind of tests. © 2017, © IMechE 2017.","Adhesive; disbonding; hot-melt; iron oxide particles; iron particles; recyclability; single lap joint","Adhesives; Electromagnetic induction; Iron oxides; Joints (structural components); Melting; Separation; Testing; disbonding; Hot melt; Iron oxide particles; Iron Particles; Recyclability; Single lap joints; Hot melt adhesives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045421100

The reuse of this waste in the most common construction materials (e.g., concrete) may offer a sustainable solution. In the literature, the optimization of composites formulations generally focuses on aggregates plant pretreatment regardless of classical optimization parameters and the implementation process that can afford to get a high strength composite. The work presented herein is intended to optimize the mix design of a mortar made from poplar wood by-products, without involving any pretreatment. The conventional mix design parameters (i.e., paste volume, W/C ratio) have been varied. An optimal implementation technique (i.e., extrusion) was used. The wood mortar mix designs have been optimized in order to obtain composites compliant with French standard NF EN 771-3/CN, with respect to criteria regarding both dimensional tolerance and mechanical strength for structural elements (i.e., above 8 MPa at 7 days).A mortar mix design, optimized by means of extrusion, has been used as a reference. Poplar wood particles have been introduced through substitution for the sand volume. Test results indicate that the blocks produced from two wood mortar mixes with 60 and 70% wood aggregate-for-sand substitution rates are in line with the normative requirements relative to dimensional tolerances and mechanical strength. This material compliance underscores the potential use of such blocks as load-bearing masonry elements, thus facilitating the building of structures with a limited environmental impact. © 2017, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Buildingblocks; Cement-based composites; Extrusion; Poplar wood; Sand mortars; Sawdust","Aggregates; Building materials; Cements; Environmental impact; Extrusion; Fits and tolerances; Masonry materials; Mortar; Product design; Sawdust; Wood; Wood products; Building blockes; Cement based composites; Classical optimization; Dimensional tolerance; High-strength composites; Implementation process; Implementation techniques; Poplar woods; Strength of materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038632186

The proposed BRB offers ease of postearthquake examination of fuse damage, convenient and prompt replacement of damaged fuses, and reuse of the buckling restraining elements. To investigate seismic behavior of the proposed BRB, seven brace specimens are tested. The test parameters varied in these specimens include fuse design, fuse material, debonding material, and loading protocol. Test results show that the proposed BRB can exhibit stable hysteretic behavior up to fairly high fuse strain levels. Failure modes of the specimens are found to be ruptures of the angle fuses, as expected. The compression strength adjustment factors and the cumulative plastic deformations of the specimens are found to satisfy the requirements specified by the current U.S. seismic design provisions for structural steel buildings.

Results show that the production of the load-bearing system would account for 40% of the global warming potential indicator. The slabs are responsible for 65% of the environmental impacts among all structural elements and should be considered for reuse first. Compared to traditional constructions built from first-use material, a fictitious reuse of undamaged load-bearing components over three consecutive use cycles would reduce the global warming potential indicator by 25%. The global warming potential of reuse is eventually computed according to three repartition methods, highlighting the need to separate the life-cycle footprints related to production, use, and end-of-life more systematically. © PLEA 2018.All rights reserved.","Building life cycle assessment; Net zero energy building; Reuse","Environmental impact; Global warming; Office buildings; Environmental benefits; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Load-bearing components; Load-bearing systems; Preliminary design; Structural elements; Traditional constructions; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086590390

The embodied carbon of this conventional design is then compared with values collected from a series of similar existing steel buildings (deQo database) as benchmark. Various scenarios regarding the impact of selective deconstruction, transportation, and cross-section oversizing are modelled and parameterized. The study eventually computes carbon savings over one life cycle of the building project. Results show that reuse remains beneficial for long transport and high oversizing.

Calculations show that 16.8 million tons of waste from wind blades will need to be managed globally by 2030, increasing to 39.8 million tons by 2050. Three waste management route are possible: disposal, recycling or reusing. Currently, most FRP composites taken out of service are disposal of in landfills or are incinerated. Recycling options consist of reclamation of the constituent fibers or the resins by thermo-chemical methods or recycling of small pieces of granular FRP material as filler material by cutting, shredding or grinding. Reuse options consist of reusing the entire FRP blade or large parts of the blade in new structural applications. This paper reports on the potential for reusing parts of wind turbine blades in new or retrofitted architectural and civil infrastructure projects. The paper introduces the geometry, materials, and laminates typically used in wind blades and provides a snapshot of the sizes of wind blades likely to be available from the inventory of active turbines. Because the materials and manufacturing of commercial wind blades are proprietary, generic blade geometries and materials are discussed. These come from the Sandia National Laboratory and National Renewable Energy Laboratory, in the United States, and from OPTIMAT in the European Union.

Structural health monitoring (SHM) is a new approach to meet safety and operational requirements especially in the above said conditions. We propose a new carbon fiber strain sensor, to be coupled to a fiber optic strain technology to realize a fail-safe/fault tolerant â€œsensors systemâ€: reading the same variables using different technologies improves radically the space modules structure monitoring. This double sensor system has been developed to provide existing and future spaceships with SHM capability due to its unique superior characteristics and reliability. This paper covers the aerospace SHM requirements and the results of the tests carried out, comparing the strain measured with the fiber optic sensor technologies to the strain as measured with a newly developed carbon fiber (In-C) sensor. In particular, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor technology and In-C sensor technologies are evaluated as the most promising tool for load monitoring and damage detection, the two critical SHM aspects of space structures. Carbon fiber sensors have never been used before as strain gauges but inexpensiveness, lightness, flexibility, and the same sensitivity of the FBG (less than 1 micro-strain) show the potential of this just patented technology. The strong cost reduction possible with In-C sensors opens the possibility of a large use of SHM systems in all the aerospace structural components. Combined with Bragg fiber sensors, gives a strong result in terms of measurement reliability and data significance. At last, in the paper the case report on the integration of this stand-alone sensor into a space structure is provided. The sensor will be integrated in the spacecraft mechanical structure, but avoiding any data connection with the space module data system and requiring only occasional power supply. The proposed solution will allow a strong cost reduction, and significant power saving, also decreasing the software complexity, assuring a longer safe lifespan of the spaceships and launchers reusability.

A prefabricated “transformer” decking is a versatile forming system, which can be arranged both as a three-dimensional closed P-structure and as a flat structure, depending on the purpose or type of a specific structural element to be strengthened and the work method to be employed. It is also technology intensive, requiring approximately 3-4 times less labor effort as compared to conventional small-panel forms used for reconstruction and overhaul of construction systems. The newly developed forming system is consistent with the environmental safety requirements, having a deck made of porous artificial wood instead of natural wood, as was previously substantiated by the authors’ calculations. Because porous artificial wood, having all the benefits of natural wood (i.e. ease of processing), is free of its drawbacks, a “transformer” form is flameproof and moisture resistant. Enhanced usability of such a forming system is achieved through the use of a material reliable in operation and easy for processing. © 2018 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Composite materials; High reusability; Multifunctionality; Technological intensity; “Transformer” forming system","Composite materials; Composite structures; Glass ceramics; Reusability; Wood; Construction systems; Environmental safety; Flat structures; Forming systems; Moisture-resistant; Multifunctionality; Structural elements; Technological intensity; Maintenance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055935747

Load-bearing systems have a particularly large environmental impact because of their material and energy intensive manufacturing process. This paper aims to address the reduction of building structures environmental impacts through reusing structural elements for multiple service lives. Reuse avoids sourcing raw materials and requires little energy for reprocessing. However, to design a new structure reusing elements available from a stock is a challenging problem of combinatorial nature. This is because the structural system layout is a result of the available elements’ mechanical and geometric properties. In this paper, structural optimization formulations are proposed to design truss systems from available stock elements. Minimization of weight, cut-off waste and embodied energy are the objective functions subject to ultimate and serviceability constraints. Case studies focusing on embodied energy minimization are presented for: (1) three roof systems with predefined geometry and topology; (2) a bridge structure whose topology is optimized using the ground structure approach; (3) a geometry optimization to better match the optimal topology from 2 and available stock element lengths. In order to benchmark the energy savings through reuse, the optimal layouts obtained with the proposed methods are compared to weight-optimized solutions made of new material. For these case studies, the methods proposed in this work enable reusing stock elements to design structures embodying up to 71% less energy and hence having a significantly lower environmental impact with respect to structures made of new material. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.","Embodied energy; Reuse; Stock assignment; Structural optimization","Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Geometry; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent computing; Roofs; Shape optimization; Topology; Embodied energy; Energy intensive manufacturing; Geometric properties; Geometry optimization; Load-bearing systems; Optimization formulations; Reuse; Stock assignment; Structural optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049076500

This depends on three key parameters—income level, size of dwelling unit and affordability. This paper aims to point out the various aspects of predestined building methodologies by highlighting the different available techniques, and the economical advantages achieved by its adoption. In a building the walls, floors and roofs are the most important sections, which can be analyzed distinctively based on the needs, thus, improving the speed of construction and reducing the construction cost. This paper also aims to cover the use of local materials in the different components of building to make them as low cost available solutions for low income groups. To own a house by middle and lower income groups in today's economic trends is very difficult. Therefore, it has now became a necessity to adopt cost effective, innovative and environment-friendly housing technologies for the construction of houses and buildings and availing them at low cost comparatively. In order to come up with viable solutions this paper compares the construction cost for the traditional and low cost housing technologies and it was observed that with the use of technology and reuse of waste material as building material the cost of construction can be minimized to an extent. It was observed that with if the filler slab can be used as an alternative to conventional slab the cost of construction can reduce upto 25%. With the time more studies are going to identify the reuse of waste material like fly ash, rice husk, etc as building material. After realizing the true potential of these waste materials as building material in construction industry the cost can be minimized to a greater extent.

This FIL with ether groups was used simultaneously as a designer templating agent and a source of the hydroxyl radical. The presence of this ionic liquid led to producing ethylene glycol in the reaction media, which adsorb on the surface of mesoporous hexagonal ZnO plates. These mesoporous structures can adsorb pollutant gases and increase photocatalytic oxidation of pollutant gases in compare with commercial ZnO nanoparticles and agglomerated nanoparticles synthesized in this work. XPS data confirmed ethylene glycol production by the ionic liquid, which could prove a role for ionic liquids as designers. The estimated BET surface area values of ZnO hexagonal mesoporous plates and agglomerated particles were 84 m2/g and 12 m2/g respectively. Optical properties of the mesoporous structures were analyzed by photoluminescence spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance UV–visible spectroscopy. The performance of these structures as efficient photocatalysts was further demonstrated by their removal of NOx, SO2 and CO under UV irradiation.

Designing these assemblies is a complex problem, since it requires a compatible decomposition of shapes with correspondence across forms, and a planning of well-matched joints to connect parts in each form. This paper presents computational methods as tools to assist the design and construction of reconfigurable assemblies, typically for furniture. There are three key contributions in this work. First, we present the compatible decomposition as a weakly-constrained dissection problem, and derive its solution based on a dynamic bipartite graph to construct parts across multiple forms; particularly, we optimize the parts reuse and preserve the geometric semantics. Second, we develop a joint connection graph to model the solution space of reconfigurable assemblies with part and joint compatibility across different forms. Third, we formulate the backward interlocking and multi-key interlocking models, with which we iteratively plan the joints consistently over multiple forms. We show the applicability of our approach by constructing reconfigurable furniture of various complexities, extend it with recursive connections to generate extensible and hierarchical structures, and fabricate a number of results using 3D printing, 2D laser cutting, and woodworking. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","Co-analysis; Computational design; Dissection; Furniture assembly; Joints; Mechanical interlocking; Reconfigurable","3D printers; Dissection; Interactive computer graphics; Iterative methods; Joints (structural components); Semantics; Co-analysis; Computational design; Design and construction; Geometric semantics; Hierarchical structures; Joint connections; Mechanical interlocking; Reconfigurable; Constrained optimization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038940769

The present work, encompassing experiments and computational analysis, critically analyzes the thermo-oxidative-structural stability of flat surface disks of spark plasma sintered ZrB2–18SiC–xTi composites (x=0, 10, 20; composition in wt%) under arc jet flow with heat flux of 2.5 MW/m2 for 30 seconds. Such testing conditions effectively simulate the aero-thermal environment in ground facility, as experienced by hypersonic vehicles. Based on the extensive XRD, SEM-EDS and electron probe microanalyzer based analysis of the surface/sub-surface of arc jet exposed ceramics, the oxidation mechanisms are qualitatively discussed. Importantly, thick oxide layers (~400-950 μm) were found to be adherent, thereby providing good structural stability of such ceramics for reusable TPS. The careful finite element (FE) analysis with high quality structural elements, being generated using HyperMesh, was conducted to understand the underlying reasons for observed oxidation. Such analysis allows us to determine the temporal evolution of through-thickness temperature distribution. FE-based calculations were subsequently validated using experimentally measured backwall temperatures. The thermodynamic feasibility of competing oxidation reactions at the analytically computed front wall temperatures was thereafter realistically assessed to support the oxidation mechanisms. Taken together, the present work provides guidelines for better understanding of the thermo-oxidative-structural stability of ceramics under arc jet testing and also establishes the good stability of ZrB2–18SiC–20Ti composites for potential application in TPS of hypersonic space vehicles. © 2017 The American Ceramic Society","arc jet testing; finite element modeling; hypersonic vehicle; SiC; Ti; ZrB2","Ceramic materials; Computational methods; Computer software reusability; Fighter aircraft; Finite element method; Heat flux; Hypersonic aerodynamics; Hypersonic vehicles; Oxidation; Plasma stability; Reentry; Silicon carbide; Stability; Structural analysis; Structural ceramics; Temperature; Titanium; Vehicles; Arc-jet testing; Electron probe micro analyzer; Hypersonic space vehicles; Performance qualifications; Thermal Protection System; Thermodynamic feasibility; Ultra-high-temperature ceramics; ZrB2; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020503748

Current approaches to modeling roof constructions consist of several consecutive operations that need to be done manually or using semi-automatic routines. To increase efficiency and allow the focus to be on analysis rather than on data processing, a set of methods was developed for the fully automated analysis of the roof constructions, including integration of architectural and structural modeling. Terrestrial laser scanning permits high-detail surveying of large-scale structures within a short time. Whereas 3-D laser scan data consist of millions of single points on the object surface, we need a geometric description of structural elements in order to obtain a structural model consisting of beam axis and connections. Preliminary results showed that the developed methods work well for beams in flawless condition with a quadratic cross section and no bending. Deformations or damages such as cracks and cuts on the wooden beams can lead to incomplete representations in the model. Overall, a high degree of automation was achieved. © Authors 2017.

Once completed the filling capacity of the pond, the need for identifying a possible reuse of mud produced by the plant arose in order to avoid landfill disposal. Therefore, mud has been geometrically, physically and chemically characterised for its recovery as construction material. A variety of tests was carried out on mud samples as required by EN technical specifications and by Italian environmental standards, focusing particularly on leaching behaviour. The tested material showed satisfactory physical and chemical properties and a release of pollutants below the limits set by the Italian code. Many mix-designs for the production of unfired bricks made of waste mud, sand and straw, stabilised and non-stabilised with lime, gypsum or cement, were developed. The bricks were tested in order to evaluate mechanical properties and leaching behaviour. Mud bricks provided remarkable compressive strength, even if not suitable for structural elements. The use as interior design to minimise humidity changes and to facilitate a thermal insulation is fostered, thus strengthening the so-called green building economy. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Aggregates; Architectural design; Building materials; Characterization; Compressive strength; Lakes; Leaching; Sustainable development; Thermal insulation; Environmental standards; Filling materials; Landfill disposal; Leaching behaviours; Physical and chemical properties; Recycled aggregates; Structural elements; Technical specifications; Brick",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028072989

The current work focuses on the behaviour of structural normal steel (hot rolled and cold formed) as well as high strength bolts after exposure to elevated temperatures. Information on stainless steel, cast iron and wrought iron is also presented. Design/methodology/approach: Due to the complexity of the issue, an elaborate presentation of the mechanical properties' influencing factors is followed. Subsequently, a wide range of experimental studies is extensively reviewed in the literature while simplified equations for determining the post-fire mechanical properties are proposed, following appropriate categorisation. Moreover, the reinstatement survey is also comprehensively described. Findings: Useful conclusions are drawn for the safe reuse of the structural elements and connection components. According to the parametric investigation of the aforementioned data, it can be safely concluded that the most common scenario of buildings after fire events, i.e. apart from excessively distorted structures, implies considerable remaining capacity of the structure, highlighting that subsequent demolition should not be the case, especially regarding critical infrastructure and buildings. Originality/value: The stability of the structure as a whole is addressed, with aim to establish specific guidelines and code provisions for the correct appraisal and rehabilitation of fire damaged structures. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,"Cast iron; Fires; Hot rolling; Mechanical properties; Steel structures; Wrought iron; Design/methodology/approach; Elevated temperature; Fire-damaged structure; High strength bolts; Parametric investigations; Remaining capacity; Simplified equations; Structural elements; Hot rolled steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014953847

However, the preparation of membranes with well-organized multilayer structures, starting from the nanoscale to maximize filtration efficiency, remains a challenge. We report a complete strategy to fully realize a novel biomaterial-based multilayer nanoporous membrane via the integration of computational simulation and experimental fabrication. Our comparative computational simulations, based on coarse-grained models of protein nanofibrils and mineral plates, reveal that the multilayer structure can only form with weak interactions between nanofibrils and mineral plates. We demonstrate experimentally that silk nanofibril (SNF) and hydroxyapatite (HAP) can be used to fabricate highly ordered multilayer membranes with nanoporous features by combining protein self-assembly and in situ biomineralization. The production is optimized to be a simple and highly repeatable process that does not require sophisticated equipment and is suitable for scaled production of low-cost water purification membranes. These membranes not only show ultrafast water penetration but also exhibit broad utility and high efficiency of removal and even reuse (in some cases) of contaminants, including heavy metal ions, dyes, proteins, and other nanoparticles in water. Our biomimetic design and synthesis of these functional SNF/HAP materials have established a paradigm that could lead to the large-scale, low-cost production of multilayer materials with broad spectrum and efficiency for water purification, with applications in wastewater treatment, bio-medicine, food industry, and the life sciences. © 2017 The Authors.",,"Biomimetic materials; Biomimetic processes; Biomineralization; Chemical contamination; Efficiency; Heavy metals; Hydroxyapatite; Lead removal (water treatment); Membranes; Metal ions; Metal nanoparticles; Microfiltration; Multilayers; Nanofibers; Plates (structural components); Proteins; Purification; Self assembly; Stripping (dyes); Structural design; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water filtration; Water treatment plants; Coarse grained models; Computational simulation; Filtration efficiency; Hydroxyapatite (HAp); Multi-layer architectures; Multilayer materials; Multilayer structures; Protein self-assemblies; Chemicals removal (water treatment)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041954887

One underexploited option to reduce embodied carbon is the reuse of structural steel. However, in the UK, work by Sansom and Avery (2014) suggests a picture of declining levels of reuse. This paper explores why this is the case by identifying the practical barriers to structural steel reuse through a series of semi-structured interviews with UK construction industry members. Whilst there were many identified barriers, five practical barriers were prioritised as being most significant: cost, availability/storage, no client demand, traceability and supply chain gaps/lack of integration. These contrast with those most commonly identified in global literature: cost, supply chain gaps/integration, risk, jointing technique, composite construction and time for deconstruction; with only two overlaps: cost and supply chain gaps/integration. Many of the barriers from literature have a technical focus (reducing salvage yield rather than completely preventing reuse) differing from the largely systemic barriers that the interviews prioritised. These systemic barriers will need to be dealt with first to increase reuse rates. This will require a coordinated approach across the UK construction supply chain. Building on interview insights, this paper proposes four mechanisms to overcome these systemic barriers: (1) the creation of a database of suppliers/reused section availability, (2) a demonstration of client demand (3) technical guidance and education for the construction industry and (4) government leadership. Together these mechanisms would improve reuse rates in the UK, reduce the embodied emissions of the built environment and play a crucial role in meeting greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Circular economy; Construction; Embodied carbon; Steel reuse; Sustainability","Building materials; Concrete slabs; Construction; Construction industry; Costs; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Steel construction; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Barriers; Circular economy; Composite construction; Embodied carbons; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Semi structured interviews; Technical guidances; UK construction industry; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014878028

In spite of the potential benefits, and in a time when “sustainability” and “climate change” are critical societal issues, the question arises: why are greater rates of structural steel reuse not being observed? One of the major factors in the rate of structural steel reuse is how decision-makers understand the life cycle implications of their choice to recycle steel rather than reuse it. This paper contributes towards our understanding of these implications, particularly the cost implications, of reuse as an alternative to recycling by presenting a streamlined life cycle analysis and identifying the major contributors to each process. The results of a case study indicate that a significant reduction in some life cycle impact metrics (greenhouse gas emissions, water use) can result from reusing structural steel rather than recycling it. The largest contributors to the life cycle impact of recycling were the shredding, melting, and forming sub-processes. The largest contributor to reuse was the deconstruction sub-process.

An analytical study is performed to predict three distinctive local buckling modes of the column and estimate its elastic flexural stiffness, yield strength, and maximum strength subjected to combined flexure and compression. Cyclic loading behavior of the column is examined through five half-scale specimens, which vary with axial force, bolt pitch, and loading direction (about major or minor axis). The columns achieve a very large elastic rotation, approximately 0.02 rad at the axial force ratio of 0.2, and a maximum bending strength surpassing the plastic moment of the reduced section accounting for bolt holes without fracture. The proposed equations predict the local buckling modes well and present a reasonably conservative estimation on the column strength subjected to combined flexure and compression. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Bolted built-up column; Combined flexure and compression; Continuous use; High-strength steel; Metal and composite structures; Seismic behavior","Axial flow; Bending strength; Bolts; Building materials; Compressive strength; Plates (structural components); Analytical studies; Bolted connections; Continuous use; Flexural stiffness; Loading direction; Seismic behavior; Structural component; Structural systems; High strength steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010332815

The goal of this paper is to show how such demountable shear connections can be implemented, which allows for easy execution and the reuse of all structural components. A key element in the suggested longitudinal shear device is injection bolts, used to fill the hole clearance with epoxy resin, increasing stiffness and ductility compared to traditional demountable composite structures.

First, laboratory tests were performed on various shredded rubber-sand mixtures to quantify the basic geotechnical engineering properties. The laboratory test results show that the shredded rubber-sand mixture is lightweight with good drainage properties and has shear strength parameters comparable to sand. This indicates that the rubber-sand mixture has potential to be used for retaining wall backfill and many other projects. To assess the economic advantage of using shredded rubber-sand mixtures as a lightweight backfill for retaining walls subjected to static and earthquake loadings, geotechnical designs of a 6 m tall gravity cantilever retaining wall were performed. The computed volume of concrete to build the structural components and volume of backfill material were compared with those of conventional sand backfill.

Steel is one of the main materials for building construction due to fast construction, light weight, and high seismic resistance. However, steel usually loses its strength and stiffness at elevated temperatures, especially over 600°C. But steel can regain some of its original mechanical properties after cooling down from the fire. Therefore, it is important to accurately evaluate the reliable performance of steel to reuse or repair the structures. For this reason, an experimental study was performed to examine the post-fire mechanical properties of steel plates SN400, SM520 and SM570 after cooling down from elevated temperatures up to 900°C. The post-fire stress-strain curves, elastic modulus, yield and ultimate strengths and residual factors were obtained and discussed.","Mechanical properties; Post-fire; Residual factors; SM520; SM570; SN400",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029947202

To provide large-scale reuse, the components of a SPL should be easy to maintain. Therefore, developers have to identify anomalous code structures – i.e., code anomalies – that are detrimental to the SPL maintainability. Otherwise, SPL changes can eventually propagate to seemly-unrelated features and affect various SPL products. Previous work often assume that each code anomaly alone suffices to characterize SPL maintenance problems, though each single anomaly may represent only a partial, insignificant, or even inexistent view of the problem. As a result, previous studies have difficulties in characterizing anomalous structures that indicate SPL maintenance problems. In this paper, we study the surrounding context of each anomaly and observe that certain anomalies may be interconnected, thereby forming so-called anomaly agglomerations. We characterize three types of agglomerations in SPL: feature, feature hierarchy, and component agglomeration. Two or more anomalies form an agglomeration when they affect the same SPL structural element, i.e. a feature, a feature hierarchy, or a component. We then investigate to what extent non-agglomerated and agglomerated anomalies represent sources of a specific SPL maintenance problem: instability. We analyze various releases of four feature-oriented SPLs. Our findings suggest that a specific type of agglomeration indicates up to 89% of sources of instability, unlike non-agglomerated anomalies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Code anomaly agglomeration; Instability; Software product line","Agglomeration; Codes (symbols); Computer software; Maintenance; Plasma stability; Code structure; Feature hierarchies; Feature-oriented; Maintenance Problem; Product-lines; Software Product Line; Software product lines; Structural elements; Computer software reusability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019213113

This system changes the vibrational energy of the structure by large earthquake with a damper, and accumulates it. Then, it reuses this energy, and drives an actuator as vibration control device. This study suggests an active absolute seismic response control by utilizing energy conversions in dampers, and reports the analysis of proposed system characteristics for the base isolation structures. (1)From the seismically response analysis results, we can reduce the maximum acceleration response within 3-25cm/s2 for the proposed system, showing the drastic response reduction effect compared with the common base isolation system. (2)An added energy (E) becomes large and an absorbed E becomes small in the energy of the actuators in accordance with the increase of the damping factor for passive dampers, depending on earthquake characteristics. The amount of energies becomes small in accordance with the period of base isolation structures. (3)The input and output of energy balance (Passive E exceeds added E.) is ineffective for earthquakes with large displacements compared with velocities. In addition, the energy conversion of passive dampers is created by adding powers of actuators. (4)Through the feature of the active absolute seismic response control, we show that the various energy can be evaluated using the structural characteristics of base isolations and earthquake's characteristics without seismic response analyses. (5)For the setting conditions, we assume the input and output energy balance is formed by decreasing the displacement gain Gd, and the acceleration response of the base isolation story can be reduced to 1/5 of common base isolation structures⋯ This setting condition tends to be formed in accordance with the increase of the damping factor and the period of base isolation structures. (6)Proposed system, i.e. the absolute response control forming the input and output of energy balance, can reduce the control force and the acceleration response of the base isolation story compared to the absolute velocity feedback control. We have presented the realization possibility of the seismic response control system showing the drastic response reduction effect without the energy supply, being equivalent to the active absolute seismic response control, through the characteristics analyses of the active absolute seismic response control by utilizing energy conversions in dampers.","Active absolute seismic response control; Active seismic response control; Base isolation structure; Energy conversion; Seismic response analyses","Actuators; Control systems; Damping; Energy balance; Energy conversion; Geophysics; Plates (structural components); Seismic response; Seismology; Active seismic; Base isolation; Characteristics analysis; Seismic response analysis; Seismic response control; Structural characteristics; System characteristics; Vibration control devices; Earthquakes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013781379

However, because the headed stud shear connectors are welded onto the top flange of the steel beam and cast into the in situ concrete slab, deconstruction of the composite beam and the reuse of its components at the end of structural life in defence to demolition is virtually impossible, which is at odds with the increasing demands placed on improving the sustainability of building infrastructure. As an alternative, an innovative sustainable composite beam and slab system is proposed, in which precast geopolymer concrete panels are attached to the steel beams using high-strength friction-grip bolts instead of cast in situ floors with pre-welded headed stud connectors. The advantages of a low-carbon design, both by the use of geopolymer concrete elements and system deconstructability, can be achieved in this proposed system. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model is developed to investigate the structural behaviour of the proposed sustainable composite beam and slab system. Material non-linearities and the interaction of the structural components are included in the model. The accuracy and reliability of the finite element formulation developed are validated by comparisons with experimental results. Extensive parametric studies are conducted to elucidate the effects of the change in the concrete panel configuration, the number and diameter of the bolts, the type and strength of the concrete and the grade of the steel beam on the behaviour of the system. The use of modified rigid plastic analysis is assessed, and a modification is suggested to predict the flexural strengths of the composite beams and slab system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Composite beams; Finite element model; Friction-grip bolt; Geopolymer concrete; Steel and composite structures; Sustainable construction","Beams and girders; Bolts; Carbon; Composite beams and girders; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete buildings; Concrete slabs; Concretes; Connectors (structural); Finite element method; Friction; Geopolymers; High strength steel; Inorganic polymers; Precast concrete; Steel beams and girders; Structural design; Studs (fasteners); Studs (structural members); Sustainable development; Welding; Composite beam; Composite steel concrete beam; Finite element formulations; Geopolymer concrete; Headed stud shear connectors; Steel and composite structures; Sustainable construction; Three dimensional finite element model; Steel castings; concrete structure; finite element method; performance assessment; steel structure; structural component; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994607950

Changes in materials, products, designs, and methodologies are occurring to accommodate this green progression. While these changes have energy and environmental benefits, questions have been raised about impacts on fire safety. There are two major reasons to consider the nexus of fire safety and sustainable design. First is a concern for the environment and how a building fire would cause environmental harm. It is possible that a single fire event can negate several, if not all, elements of green design. Second is a concern that sustainable design features will cause unintended increased fire risk or hazards. Sustainable design is a relatively new market with some unconventional materials, techniques, and features that have not yet been proven with time, which introduces risk of unintentional consequences. Moving forward, it would be valuable to integrate green design with fire safety such that they reinforce rather than undermine each other. This article seeks to examine the relationship between fire safety and sustainability in buildings, discuss the status of the fire and sustainability communities, and recommend avenues for development and implementation to promote fire-safe sustainable designs. Such avenues include incorporating greywater and rainwater reuse systems with fire sprinklers, fire alerts and controls in building automation systems, better safety mechanisms and designs for on-site energy production and storage, and less combustible and more resilient structural elements and insulation. © 2016, Springer International Publishing AG.","Fire safety; Green design; Insulation; Life cycle assessment; Rooftop solar; Sustainable building","Automation; Ecodesign; Fires; Hose; Intelligent buildings; Wastewater reclamation; Building fires; Environmental benefits; Fire sprinklers; On-site energy; Safety mechanisms; Structural elements; Sustainability communities; Sustainable building; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060954635

In addition, using deconstructable steel-concrete composite floors can facilitate component recycling and reuse and can improve the sustainability of the building industry significantly by reducing energy consumption and construction waste at demolition. This paper investigates the structural behaviour of an innovative beam-to-column composite semi-rigid joint with deconstructable post-installed friction-grip bolted shear connectors and grade S690 high strength steel flush end plates. Non-linear continuum-based finite element models are developed and validated against results of four full-scale laboratory tests of this innovative joint. The validated finite element models are used for conducting an extensive parametric study in which the effects of the reinforcement ratio, thickness of the precast concrete slab, degree of shear connection, number of bolted shear connectors, size of the bolts in the connection zone, size of the steel beam and thickness of the flush end plate on the structural behaviour of a composite joint with deconstructable post-installed friction-grip bolted shear connectors and grade S690 high strength steel flush end plates are investigated. A simple analytical model is proposed to predict the moment capacity and rotation capacity of this type of composite joint. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Composite joints; Deconstructable; Finite element model; Friction-grip bolt; High strength steel; Sustainable","Bolts; Carbon steel; Concrete slabs; Concretes; Construction industry; Corrosion resistance; Energy utilization; Finite element method; Friction; Joints (structural components); Plates (structural components); Precast concrete; Shear flow; Sustainable development; Tribology; Composite joint; Construction wastes; Deconstructable; Reducing energy consumption; Reinforcement ratios; Steel-concrete composite floor; Structural behaviour; Sustainable; High strength steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986559270

Specifically, the distance between planning and execution brings cost overruns and duration extensions. To minimize variations, this research presents a Building Information Modeling (BIM)-integrated simulation framework for predicting productivity dynamics at the construction planning phase. To develop this framework, we examined critical factors affecting productivity at the operational level, and then forecast the productivity dynamics. The resulting plan includes specific commands for retrieving the required information from BIM and executing operation simulations. It consists of the following steps: (1) preparing a BIM model to produce input data; (2) composing a construction simulation at the operational level; and (3) obtaining productivity dynamics from the BIM-integrated simulation. To validate our framework, we applied it to a structural steel model; this was due to the significance of steel erections. By integrating BIM with construction operation simulations, we were able to create reliable construction plans that adapted to project changes. Our results show that the developed framework facilitates the reliable prediction of productivity dynamics, and can contribute to improved schedule reliability, optimized resource allocation, cost savings associated with buffers, and reduced material waste.. © 2016 by the authors.","Building information modeling; Computer simulation; Data reuse; Just-In-Time; Lean construction; Productivity dynamics","computer simulation; cost analysis; data acquisition; integrated approach; numerical model; resource allocation; resource use; steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85000741819

This enormous quantity causing major economic problems and environmental problems over the paper and board industry. In order to confront with the economic problems associated with waste disposal costs, which make up almost half of the cost of wastewater treatment, there is a need to provide a viable solution to the reuse of waste and by reducing the use of natural resources. Hence, a comparative analysis of the experimental results novel properties of fresh and hardened concrete with recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) with different substitution of waste paper sludge ash (WPSA) as a partial substitute for cement is presented in the paper. Recycled aggregates is made by crushing the waste concrete cube laboratory tests. Recycled aggregate is made by crushing the concrete waste at laboratory. Utilize of WPSA and RCA is estimated to produce significant gains in strength performance (determine the strength characteristics of concrete structures) and properties of workability and water absorption for each series of mixed. Therefore, the application of those testing method were measured the quality of concrete, so that they can perform satisfactorily as structural element.

Due to the solution space complexity a lot of layup configurations are evaluated during the optimization process. This fact leads to the mandatory requirement that the configuration evaluation should be fast enough to ensure the convergence of the optimization procedure without sacrificing the accuracy. In this work, we propose a robust, accurate and very fast finite element model based on the first-order shear deformation theory (FSDT). The model is structured in three main parts: preprocessing, processing and post processing. The main strategy is to transfer as much as possible operations in the preprocessing phase which is executed only once and to subsequently reuse the results in the processing and post processing phases which are executed for each layup configuration. Using this strategy, the execution time of the processing and post processing phases is drastically reduced and almost consists of regenerating and solving the global linear system - more that 95%. The proposed procedure is relatively easy to implement in Matlab which holds a very powerful linear system solver for sparse matrices. Also, the accuracy of the model was demonstrated by comparison with Ansys and with some closed form solutions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Laminated composites; Linear systems; Optimization; Plates (structural components); Shear deformation; Closed form solutions; Composite laminate; Computational technique; First-order shear deformation theory; Linear system solver; Mandatory requirement; Optimization procedures; Preprocessing phase; Finite element method",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84989843395

It consumes more than half of the total global resources; it is responsible for more than a third of the total global energy use and associated emissions; and generates the greatest and most voluminous waste stream globally. Reuse is considered to be a material and carbon saving practice highly recommended in the construction sector as it can address both waste and carbon emission regulatory targets. This practice offers the possibility to conserve resources through the reclamation of structural components and the carbon embedded in them, as well as opportunities for the development of new business models and the creation of environmental, economic, technical and social value. This paper focuses on the identification and analysis of existing interventions that can promote the reuse of construction components, and outlines the barriers and opportunities arising from this practice as depicted from the global literature. The main conclusions that derive from this study are that the combination of incentives that promote reuse of construction components and recycling of the rest of the construction materials with the provision of specialised education, skills and training would transform the way construction sector currently operates and create opportunities for new business development. Moreover, a typology system developed based on the properties and lifetime of construction components is required in order to provide transparency and guidance in the way construction components are used and reused, in order to make them readily available to designers and contractors. Smart technologies carry the potential to aid the development and uptake of this system by enabling efficient tracking, storage and archiving, while providing information relevant to the environmental and economic savings that can be regained, enabling also better decision-making during construction and deconstruction works.

The slip-form method, which is a typical moving form method, has advantages such as reduced construction duration and simple components because it enables continuous forming work of concrete in a single construction. However, it is vulnerable to corrosion, quality control is difficult, and the form plate cannot be reused. In this study, a tensile test was carried out on a GFRP plate by using a new method to apply the steel form to the GFRP plate. Effective GFRP slip-form shape and the application method were proposed by conducting finite element analysis and parametric analysis based on the results of the GFRP plate tensile test; performance was verified through a structural test.

Indeed, in recent years, there is a growing interest in composites with thermoplastic matrix thanks to the considerable advantages in terms of recyclability, and the reduction in weight and in production costs. In the automotive sector, increasingly stringent requirements for reduced emissions of CO2, the maximum return on capital investment and the increase in plastic recycling and reuse, are some of the most important problems that directly influence the development of new materials. The thermoplastic composites appear to be the right alternative to the materials currently used for vehicles. They can replace not only the not structural parts (such as the interiors), but also the structural components located in areas potentially subject to impacts. This paper presents the results of an experimental campaign made on a full thermoplastic composite, where both the reinforcement and the matrix are made in thermoplastic. The target is to know the mechanical properties in order to design an energy absorber with this new material. Initially, tensile, compression, bending and shear tests were made according to standards to obtain the mechanical characteristics. Subsequently, static and dynamic tests on thin-walled cylindrical tubes subjected to axial load were made in order to assess the energy absorption capacity varying the project parameters. The data were recorded and analyzed in terms of load-displacement curves, specific energy absorption (SEA), crush force efficiency (CFE), stroke efficiency (SE) and crushing stress. Comparing the new material to a common thermosets composite, different values of SEA are evident; fully thermoplastic composites are 3/4 times lower in energy absorption capacity. Nevertheless, taking into account the other favorable characteristic (such as full recyclability and shorter processing times) this fully thermoplastic material continues to be interesting for lightweight design. From the point of view of the energy absorption its spring back behavior offers some advantages respect to thermoset and conventional materials that tend to shatter and to buckle in the event of impact, respectively. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy absorber; Experimental evaluation; Thermoplastic composite","Automotive industry; Bending tests; Carbon dioxide; Composite materials; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Investments; Mechanical properties; Plastics; Reinforced plastics; Thermoplastics; Thermosets; Thin walled structures; Energy absorbers; Energy absorption capacity; Experimental evaluation; Mechanical characteristics; Specific energy absorption; Static and dynamic tests; Thermoplastic composite; Thermoplastic materials; Polymer matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84953275860

An efficient response from the building sector requires research aimed at the minimisation of the environmental impact of buildings throughout their life cycle, from construction to demolition. The end of a buildings service life can critically influence the total environmental impact, particularly with building technologies such as steel construction. The purpose of the current research was the assessment of the environmental impact caused by different end-of-life scenarios as can be applied to steel buildings. An existing residential steel building is used for the calculations, while the results allow for the comparison between the different end scenarios concerning the main structural materials used, namely the structural steel. Conclusions drawn include the formation of a clear perspective on the environmental impact benefits that can be achieved at the end of a steel buildings life cycle and the positive effects of the steel construction technology as applied to building projects in terms of environmental sustainability.

As contribution to research in this area, this paper introduces new approach to intellectual content driven context structure for driving generation process for elements of requirements, functional, logical, and physical (RFLP) structured generic engineering model. The formerly developed initiative, behavior, con-text, and action (IBCA) driving content structure and its processing procedures were revised and extended for this purpose. The new approach supposes R, F, L, and P levels in engineering model, intellectual property (IP) type knowledge accumulation and reuse, and virtually executable structure of global product level contextual simulations. Industrial engineering system is required as implementation environment which is able to organize and manage engineering models for lifecycle of product. This paper starts with discussion of relevant structural elements and features of engineering model which can accommodate the proposed approach based engineering model components.

The most commonly known reason for this fact is the lack of information about stress history in used structural steel members. To address this deficiency, prior to construction, selected steel members of a steel-framed building were instrumented before they are delivered to the construction site. Continuous strain data was collected during the entire erecting process of the new building using a wireless sensor network to obtain novel information on construction-induced stresses. The collected data will be used to assess the magnitude of construction induced stresses.

The appraisal is carried out by means of life cycle assessment (LCA) and covers different timber constructions, mainly the multi-storey building. The ultimate goal is to compare their environmental performance to the outcomes of other constructions like reinforced concrete (RC) and steel construction (SC). The environmental burdens caused by constructions are evaluated based on the framework of LCA. First, the material inventory of selected building projects is established. The scope is emphasised on the primary structural elements such as columns, beams, deck, load-bearing wall and roof. Secondary components, facility and decoration are eliminated out of the research boundary. Based on the material inventory, the impact assessment is carried out to preliminarily calculate the embodied outcome of the timber constructions. The environmental implications of structural elements during early life cycle stages are evaluated. Then, the effect of both disposal and material recycling is integrated in the LCA, including reuse or recovery of the structural wooden components. The LCA takes into account different disposal scenarios associated with construction and demolition waste (C&DW). By doing so, the LCA is the so-called 'from cradle to gate' and 'gate to cradle', without consideration upon the using phase. Among numerous environmental indictors, this research quantifies and discusses the energy consumption and global warming potential (GWP) of the timber buildings only. The five-storey timber building located in urban context is a pioneer project in Taiwan. This building applies crosslaminated-timber (CLT) as the primary structural elements and takes over tremendous loading circumstances. It demonstrates not only the engineering feasibility of CLT for architectural design but also the utilising compatibility of wooden house in urban context. The environmental evaluation proofs the ecological efficiency of timber buildings. In addition, this study compares the environmental performance of timber constructions and other materials. Alternative building models made of RC and steel are developed and intended for further LCA. The LCA results demonstrate that timber constructions cause significantly less impacts than RC and SC do. Timber constructions exhibit carbon sequestration effect, which is unique among three materials. Meanwhile, timber constructions consume only about 20% energy of the RC and SC. While possessing similar form and functionality, timber constructions exhibit better eco-efficiency compared to other generally used materials. When the material recycling is taken into account, the life-cycle eco-efficiency of timber structures is further significant. Wooden constructions can be energy-neutral or even energy-productive, depending on the recycling strategies.","Cross laminated timber (CLT); LCA; Multi-storey timber building; Timber construction","Buildings; Carbon; Demolition; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Global warming; Life cycle; Recycling; Reinforced concrete; Structural design; Waste disposal; Wooden buildings; Wooden construction; Construction and demolition waste; Cross laminated; Environmental evaluation; Environmental implications; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Timber buildings; Timber construction; Timber",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010952516

Design problems form an essential component of experiments in creativity research. However, the formulation of a design problem for an experiment is still a challenging task. An opportunity for the design community is leverage existing design problems to reduce a source of difference between experiments and increase the validity of new method and tools. To answer this question, fifty-five design problems, published over the past fifteen years, were collected and analyzed using two approaches. First, the information content of the design problems was assessed based on five structural elements. A protocol study was developed with four independent evaluators, who were asked to identify the five elements in a set of design problems. A high correlation was observed for the characteristics: goal of a problem, functional requirements, non-functional requirement and reference to an existing product. A low correlation was observed for the characteristics information about end user. The results suggest that this approach could serve as a useful tool in comparing and selecting problems with a desired number of elements. In the second approach, latent semantic analysis was used to compare the design problems. Latent semantic analysis enables design problem similarity to be computed prior to solving the problem. However, this method cannot identify the nuances in problem representations, which could potentially affect solution development. The paper concludes with an appeal to research community of using similar or benchmarked design problems, and postulate other means to enable comparison or development of problems in creativity research.

Mass customization has aided to decreasing the production costs and the time to reach the final consummator. But, the rapid change in technology and in social and individual expectative, as well as, the explosion of the concurrence demand new and efficient methods for products development. In order to assume these challenges, products lines approach looks for the reuse of common characteristics of products and the harnessing of the variability of other characteristics useful to satisfy exigencies of customers. The features model, widely used in the development of products lines, has limitations to treat the complexity of domains, to adopt standard guides to construction and segmentation of domain models. In our research, domain knowledge is organized in different ways, in order to represent tangible and intangible realities using mathematical, conceptual, and physical models. Traditional engineering, as mechanical, civil, materials, and hydraulic has important applications in automotive, and aerospace industry, and in the construction of ships, buildings, railways, roads, among others. There, it is easy to appreciate the common use of ideal, conceptual, and physical models in projects development. In civil engineering, for example, new structural elements, their conceptual representations, mathematical models, software systems for analysis and design, and physical models use concepts of a domain model, which depict common and variable characteristics of a products line. In this work, we model domain in terms of goals and characteristics, highlighting the reusable part of products and the variability. This domain model allows the application of products line concepts to the analysis, design and construction of structural elements in civil engineering.

Many of these buildings are still operational; comprising brittle materials with no reinforcements, with spatially distributed mass and stiffness, they are not encompassed by current seismic assessment procedures that have been developed for other structural types. To facilitate the difficult task of selecting a proper rehabilitation strategy - often restricted by international treaties for non-invasiveness and reversibility of the intervention - and given the practical requirements for the buildings' intended reuse, this paper presents a practical procedure for assessment of seismic demands of URM buildings - mainly historical constructions that lack a well-defined diaphragm action. A key ingredient of the method is approximation of the spatial shape of lateral translation, Φ, that the building assumes when subjected to a uniform field of lateral acceleration. Using Φ as a 3-D shape function, the dynamic response of the system is evaluated, using the concepts of SDOF approximation of continuous systems. This enables determination of the envelope of the developed deformations and the tendency for deformation and damage localization throughout the examined building for a given design earthquake scenario. Deformation demands are specified in terms of relative drift ratios referring to the in-plane and the out-of-plane seismic response of the building's structural elements. Drift ratio demands are compared with drift capacities associated with predefined performance limits. The accuracy of the introduced procedure is evaluated through (a) comparison of the response profiles with those obtained from detailed time-history dynamic analysis using a suite of ten strong ground motion records, five of which with near-field characteristics, and (b) evaluation of the performance assessment results with observations reported in reconnaissance reports of the field performance of two neoclassical torsionally-sensitive historical buildings, located in Thessaloniki, Greece, which survived a major earthquake in the past. © 2016 Techno-Press, Ltd.","Historical and monumental buildings; Pushover analysis; Seismic assessment; Torsion; Unreinforced masonry structures (URM)","Buildings; Damage detection; Deformation; Earthquake effects; Geophysics; Masonry materials; Seismic response; Seismology; Torsional stress; Deformation and damages; Monumental buildings; Near-field characteristics; Push-over analysis; Rehabilitation strategy; Seismic assessment; Time-history dynamic analysis; Unreinforced masonry structures; Earthquakes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984675545

However, the high thermal conductivity of steel presents a drawback, which may lead to thermal bridges if not well designed and executed. Furthermore, given the high number of steel profiles and its reduced thickness, it is not an easy task to accurately predict its thermal performance in laboratory and even less in situ. In a previous article, the authors studied the importance of flaking heat loss in lightweight steel-framed walls. This article discusses several thermal bridges mitigation strategies to improve a lightweight steel-framed wall model, which increase its thermal performance and reduce the energy consumption. The implementation of those mitigation strategies leads to a reduction of 8.3% in the U-value, comparatively to the reference case. An optimization of the wall module insulation layers is also performed (e.g. making use of new insulation materials: aerogel and vacuum insulation panels), which combined with the mitigation approaches allows a decrease of 68% in the U-value, also relatively to the reference case. Some design rules for lightweight steel-framed elements are also presented. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions.","design rules; Lightweight steel frame; lightweight steel-framed walls; mitigation strategies; parametric study; thermal bridges; thermal transmittance","Bridges; Energy utilization; Insulation; Thermal insulation; Vacuum applications; Walls (structural partitions); Design rules; Light-weight steels; Lightweight steel framed walls; Mitigation strategy; Parametric study; Thermal bridge; Thermal transmittance; Thermal conductivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949683997

Geometric characterization is demonstrated in this article to have a key role to play in the decision process for each case of potential steel reuse, because it is necessary for identifying unknown in situ member sizes and assembly geometries, and for quantifying uncertainty when assessing the reliability of a structure. Without automation of this analysis, it is speculated that such a detailed decision making process would not be feasible. The key role of geometric characterization is demonstrated in this article through a series of remote, 3D imaging experiments and reliability analyses. The reliability analysis demonstrated that automated geometric identification using an algorithm developed for the current study results in a 56% reduction in capacity when compared to similar new steel members. Alternatively, more manual methods of remote geometry detection resulted in only a 2% reduction in capacity. It is concluded that semi-automated geometric characterization has the potential to support increased steel reuse through reduced identification costs and improved reliability. A new set of methods and an understanding of their utility in making reuse more attractive through reduced costs and improved reliability is thus contributed. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we propose a framework for joint radio resource management, where we systematically decompose the problem in BH and access links. To simplify the analysis, the procedure is tackled in two stages. At the first stage, the joint optimization problem is formulated for a point-to-point scenario where each small cell is simply associated with a single user. It is shown that the optimization can be decomposed into separate power and subchannel allocation in both BH and access links, where a set of rate-balancing parameters in conjunction with duration of transmission governs the coupling across both links. Moreover, a novel algorithm is proposed based on grouping the cells to achieve rate balancing in different small cells. Next, in the second stage, the problem is generalized for multiaccess small cells. Here, each small cell is associated with multiple users to provide the service. The optimization is similarly decomposed into separate subchannel and power allocation by employing auxiliary slicing variables. It is shown that similar algorithms, as in the previous stage, are applicable by a slight change with the aid of slicing variables. Additionally, for the special case of line-of-sight BH links, simplified expressions for subchannel and power allocation are presented. The developed concepts are evaluated by extensive simulations in different case studies from full orthogonalization to dynamic clustering and full reuse in the downlink, and it is shown that the proposed framework provides significant improvement over the benchmark cases. © 1967-2012 IEEE.","Downlink; Interference; Joints; Optimization; Relays; Resource management; Vectors","Algorithms; Cells; Cytology; Joints (structural components); Natural resources management; Radio links; Resource allocation; Telecommunication links; Vectors; Wave interference; Downlink; Extensive simulations; Joint radio resource managements; Relays; Resource management; Simplified expressions; Subchannel allocation; Time division duplexing; Optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84947771275

While argon production is essentially less than helium production in irradiated materials, at other times its impact, e.g., in the inhalation dose, becomes significant. In some cases the Ar-39 activity is comparable or even exceeds the C-14 activity and may become apparent after tritium removal from plasma exhaust and dust, from the liquid breeders, during plasma-facing and structural component recycling and waste management.

The paper examines whether Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology coupled with Building Information Modelling (BIM) may enable components and/or assemblies to be tracked and imported into virtual models for new buildings at the design stage. The addition of stress sensors to components, which provides the capability of quantifying the stress properties of steel over its working life, may also support best practice reuse of resources. The potential to improve resource efficiency in many areas of production and consumption, emerging from a novel combination of such technologies, is highlighted using a theoretical case study scenario. In addition, a case analysis of the demolition/deconstruction of a former industrial building is conducted to illustrate potential savings in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) from reuse when compared with recycling. The paper outlines the reasoning behind the combination of the discussed technologies and alludes to some possible applications and new business models. For example, a company that currently manufactures and 'sells' steel, or a third party, could find new business opportunities by becoming a 'reseller' of reused steel and providing a 'steel service'.

We investigated the solidification/stabilization and leaching behavior of PbCl2 in a geopolymer matrix (GM) and hydrated silicate matrix (HSM), based on FA as the source material, to evaluate the environmental and health risks. The GM and HSM synthetic conditions were 60 °C, 20 % relative humidity (RH), and 12 wt% (6 mol/L) NaOH, and 20 ± 2 °C, ≥90 % RH, and 30 wt.%, respectively, based on their compressive strength performances. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that Pb participated in hydration and geopolymerization, and was incorporated in the structural components of the hydrated silicate and geopolymer. In leaching experiments, the solidification/stabilization effects of Pb and Cl in the HSM and GM improved with increasing curing time. After long-term curing (28 days), the immobility of Pb in the GM was better than that in the HSM. Sodalite improved the Cl-stabilizing ability of the GM compared with that of the HSM. In static monolithic leaching experiments, HSM and GM had the same Pb-leaching behaviors. Based on the changes in the location of the neutral sphere layer with decreasing acid-neutralizing capacity, Pb release was divided into alkaline-release, stagnation, and acid-release stages. The neutral sphere layer contained the highest Pb concentration during permeation toward the block center from the block edge. This behavior regulation could also apply to other amphoteric metals immobilized by GMs and HSMs. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Construction material; Fly ash; Geopolymer; Hydrated silicate; Leaching; Lead; Solidification/stabilization","fly ash; lead; lead chloride; polymer; silicate; analysis; building material; chemistry; fly ash; incineration; procedures; recycling; waste disposal; Coal Ash; Construction Materials; Incineration; Lead; Polymers; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Silicates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939982063

The interference between SUs actually carries information and can potentially be exploited to improve the network performance through information-theoretic interference processing. In this paper, we design an optimal joint power and rate control algorithm that maximizes the secondary system utility subject to the interference temperature constraints of primary users based on the capacity-approaching interference processing scheme called as the Han-Kobayashi scheme. The optimal solution is difficult to achieve because the optimization problem is in general non-convex. To make the optimization problem tractable, this paper first transforms the problem into a monotonic optimization problem through exploiting its hidden monotonicity. We then devise an effective algorithm to obtain the global optimal solution to the joint power and rate control problem in the Han-Kobayashi scheme. The key idea behind the proposed algorithm is to construct a sequence of shrinking polyblocks that approximate the upper boundary of the feasible region with increasing precision. Numerical results further show that the achieved utility of our scheme significantly outperforms the utility of conventional schemes which treat the interference between SUs as the noise. © 2015 IEEE.","Cognitive radio networks; Interference channels; Interference processing; Joint power and rate control; Joints; Monotonic Optimization; Noise; Optimization; Receivers; Utility Maximization; Vectors","Algorithms; Information theory; Joints (structural components); Optimal systems; Optimization; Radio; Radio systems; Receivers (containers); Vectors; Cognitive radio network; Interference channels; Joint power; Monotonic optimization; Noise; Utility maximizations; Cognitive radio",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930204071

The effects of operational variables on the performance of micro-photoreactor were studied. Higher photocatalytic degradation is obtained for low flow rates, high light intensities, long micro-channels lengths, and low inlet concentrations.

However, prudent determination of suitability for reuse or rehabilitation of fire-damaged prestressed concrete requires a post-fire structural evaluation, which can be greatly aided by application of nondestructive testing for quantitative assessment of residual material properties, structural strength, and serviceability. In this study, a suite of nondestructive inspection and evaluation methods including visual documentation, camber surveying, penetration resistance testing, and impact-echo are applied to fire-damaged and unaffected double-tee joists of a precast, prestressed roof system. Qualitative and quantitative measures of fire damage obtained through the nondestructive tests are presented and strong correlations, in particular between longitudinal wave speed estimates obtained in impact-echo testing and depth of probe penetration, are exhibited in the test results. Furthermore, the test results are compared with empirical models of residual compressive strength and residual elastic modulus of concrete following exposure to high temperatures. These results support recent laboratory studies suggesting that nondestructive measurements of longitudinal wave speed or pulse velocity through fire-damaged concrete may be linearly related to relative reductions in compressive strength. Results from a survey of the camber in the fire damaged joists is also presented with conceivable interpretation of the observed profiles to highlight the shortcomings of this often recommended practice and emphasize the need for more definitive nondestructive test methods. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Fire damage; Fire resistance; Impact-echo; Nondestructive testing; Prestressed Concrete; Windsor probe","Cambers; Compressive strength; Concrete testing; Fire hazards; Fire resistance; Hardness; Prestressed concrete; Probes; Roofs; Surveys; Fire damages; Impact echo; Non destructive evaluation; Non destructive inspection; Non-destructive measurement; Non-destructive test methods; Residual compressive strength; Windsor probe; Nondestructive examination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924943571

In the last decade, several researchers have been studying the recycling and reuse processes of composite components, mainly to use in secondary (non-structural) components. In this paper, uncured aerospace grade prepreg scraps resulted from the production waste were used to manufacture laminates. The carbon reinforcement of the prepreg presented plain weave style fabric. The manufacture used was hand lay-up process positioning the scraps randomly without respecting the preferred directions of the warp and weft. Therefore, the resulting laminate is multidirectional (in the plane) and orthotropic. The cure was performed in autoclave at the maximum temperature of (180 ± 1)°C and pressure of 100 psi. This laminate was tested in compression according to standard SACMA SEM 1R-94. The results show an average compression resistance equivalent to that of laminates produced with continuous layers, although with a higher dispersion. In order to understand this variation, the fracture surfaces of the laminates were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to identify the failure modes. The specimens present shear and interlaminar failure modes, in addition to a mixed mode of failure (a transition between the shear and interlaminar failures). For the same specimen, the analysis of the internal arrangement of the fibers shows that changes in failure modes occur in regions where the carbon fabric is not continuous, i.e. there are junctions of scraps. It was also observed that none of the compression tests resulted in catastrophic failure of the specimens, possibly due to a greater resistance to fracture growth in the presence of mixed failure mode. © 2015 International Committee on Composite Materials.

Experimental modal analysis of a precast, prestressed concrete roof comprised of modular double-tee joists was performed following exposure to an accidental fire. Empirical evidence of localized structural degradation is identified in the mode shapes, which suggests that modal parameters are sensitive to fire-induced damage in prestressed concrete members. Additionally, measured out-of-plane global modes are correlated with finite element simulations using a model of the as-built roof as well as a model updated using a large set of impact-echo measurements across the double-tee roof to spatially map localized reductions in stiffness. The comparisons support the experimental conclusions and further demonstrate that, by coupling nondestructive techniques, it is possible to construct a validated analytical model of structural components with sufficient fidelity to assess suitability for rehabilitation and reuse. With further development, vibration-based monitoring and structural identification may be an attractive alternative to physical load testing, particularly when the risk of structural collapse under proof testing loads is high.

Firstly, the machining features are recognized from an MBD model, which are taken as the machining semantics carrier. Then, the coupled machining feature cluster is introduced to construct the greater granularity’s independent structural element than machining feature, which describes the feature interactions. Finally, the MBD model is structured based on machining features and coupled machining feature clusters in a hierarchical way.

This is especially true when structural elements require a specific and restricted habitat, or if the construction of nests is costly in time and energy. The availability of nesting-platforms is influenced by nest creation and persistence. In a Mediterranean forest in southeastern Spain, nesting-platforms are the only structural element for three forest-dwelling raptor species: booted eagle Aquila pennata , common buzzard Buteo buteo and northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis. From 1998 to 2013, we tracked the fate of 157 nesting-platforms built and reused by these species with the aim of determining the rates of creation and destruction of nesting-platforms, estimating nest persistence by applying two survival analyses, describing the pattern of nest reuse and testing the effects of nest use on breeding success. Nest creation and destruction rates were low (0.14 and 0.05, respectively). Using Kaplan Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional-hazards regression models we found that median nest longevity was 12 years and that this was not significantly affected by nest characteristics, nest-tree dimensions, nest-builder species, or frequency of use of the platform. We also estimated a transition matrix, considering the different stages of nest occupation (vacant or occupied by one of the focal species), to obtain the fundamental matrix and the average life expectancies of nests, which varied from 17.9 to 19.7 years. Eighty six percent of nests were used in at least one breeding attempt, 67.5% were reused and 17.8% were successively occupied by at least two of the study species. The frequency of nest use had no significant effects on the breeding success of any species. We conclude that nesting-platforms constitute an important resource for forest raptors and that their longevity is sufficiently high to allow their reuse in multiple breeding attempts. © 2014 Jiménez-Franco et al.",,"Accipiter gentilis; Aquila pennata; article; breeding success; Buteo buteo; controlled study; forest; life expectancy; lifespan; longevity; mathematical analysis; nesting; nonhuman; raptor; species difference; animal; breeding; female; nesting; physiology; proportional hazards model; raptor; Southern Europe; time; Animals; Breeding; Female; Forests; Mediterranean Region; Nesting Behavior; Proportional Hazards Models; Raptors; Species Specificity; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899536547

The proposed numerical method is an approach to simulate the acoustical behavior of such multi-layered panels. The model assumes plate-like structures and, hence, combines plate theories for the different layers. The poroelastic layer is modelled with a recently developed plate theory. This theory uses a series expansion in thickness direction with subsequent analytical integration in this direction to reduce the three dimensions to two. The same idea is used to model either air gaps or fibrous layers. The latter are modeled as equivalent fluid and can be handled like an air gap, i.e., a kind of 'air plate' is used. The coupling of the layers is done by using the series expansion to express the continuity conditions on the surfaces of the plates. The final system is solved with finite elements, where domain decomposition techniques in combination with preconditioned iterative solvers are applied to solve the final system of equations. In a large frequency range, the comparison with measurements shows very good agreement. From the numerical solution process it can be concluded that different preconditioners for the different layers are necessary. A reuse of the Krylov subspace of the iterative solvers pays if several excitations have to be computed but not that much in the loop over the frequencies. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Iterative solver with recycling subspace; Multilayered panels; Plate; Poroelasticity; Sound transmission","Acoustic wave transmission; Air; Architectural acoustics; Domain decomposition methods; Iterative methods; Numerical methods; Plating; Transmissions; Analytical integration; Comparison with measurements; Continuity conditions; Domain decomposition techniques; Iterative solvers; Multilayered panels; Poro-elasticity; Sound transmission; Plates (structural components)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84899442052

We have created the BioAssay Ontology (BAO) project (http:// bioassayontology.org) to develop common reference metadata terms and definitions required for describing relevant information of low-and high-throughput drug and probe screening assays and results. The main objectives of BAO are to enable effective integration, aggregation, retrieval, and analyses of drug screening data. Since we first released BAO on the BioPortal in 2010 we have considerably expanded and enhanced BAO and we have applied the ontology in several internal and external collaborative projects, for example the BioAssay Research Database (BARD). We describe the evolution of BAO with a design that enables modeling complex assays including profile and panel assays such as those in the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). One of the critical questions in evolving BAO is the following: how can we provide a way to efficiently reuse and share among various research projects specific parts of our ontologies without violating the integrity of the ontology and without creating redundancies. This paper provides a comprehensive answer to this question with a description of a methodology for ontology modularization using a layered architecture. Our modularization approach defines several distinct BAO components and separates internal from external modules and domain-level from structural components. This approach facilitates the generation/extraction of derived ontologies (or perspectives) that can suit particular use cases or software applications. We describe the evolution of BAO related to its formal structures, engineering approaches, and content to enable modeling of complex assays and integration with other ontologies and datasets. © 2014 Abeyruwan et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84938093882

These structural elements present great potential for recycling and reuse, allowing the conservation of natural resources and the environment. When compared with other materials, these construction components also provide other advantages: reduced weight with simultaneous high mechanical strength; easier prefabrication, allowing modular elements and higher quality control; shorter periods for assembling the building on-site; no dimensional variations caused by moisture; and low cost. The high thermal conductivity of steel could be a drawback, leading to thermal bridges if not well designed and executed. In the case of LSF components (e.g. walls and slabs) it is necessary to take special care with the elements' design optimisation, with it being essential to use continuous thermal insulation. The building envelope thermal performance is crucial to provide good thermal behaviour and energy efficiency, allowing a reduction of operational energy. In this paper, the LSF construction system is analysed in order to show its main advantages and drawbacks. The assessment of embodied and operational energy is essential to perform a life cycle analysis. The reduction of both energies' consumption is crucial to increase the sustainability label.

Current practices dictate that all required measurements are recorded by hand using tape measures and calipers which adds a significant cost to reused steel. To mitigate this cost, a semi-automated method for identifying structural steel components and systems is proposed that uses data acquired in the form of a 3D point cloud. Current research in the field of automated object recognition currently has two major limitations: (1) a priori knowledge, such as a building information model (BIM) is required, or (2) only simple, flat surfaces can be identified. The purpose of this study is to preliminarily investigate the possibility of automating the process of (1) cross section identification, (2) end connection geometry of bolted connections, and (3) relative component position of multi-component, planar structural systems such as trusses. Cross section identification is performed by creating filters that match standard structural sections and then convolving them over images of the cross section data. The end connection geometry is identified using Hough algorithms to detect lines and circles representing the limits of the component and the bolt holes, respectively. Planar structural systems are identified using Hough algorithms to detect lines which represent the components of the system. The results from the proposed methods show a strong potential for fully automated processes to be able to identify structural steel components and systems without a priori knowledge.","3D Imaging; Automation; Object Identification; Steel Reuse","Architectural design; Building materials; Filtration; Image matching; Object recognition; Robotics; Steel construction; Struts; 3D imaging; Automated identification; Automated object recognition; Building Information Model - BIM; Object identification; Structural sections; Structural steel components; Structural steel members; Automation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84912544614

Deconstruction techniques allow structures to be designed so that they may be conveniently dismantled in the future. This will allow potential reuse of recycling of steel for future use. Rehabilitation allows structures to have their life extended. Both deconstruction and rehabilitation techniques have the potential to significantly reduce the amount of use of structural steel in construction which has the potential to have significant benefits for sustainable construction methods.

Among stainless steels, ferritic and lean duplex grades are characterized by low nickel content resulting in a more cost-stable and economic material compared to austenitic stainless steels. These grades have comparable (or even higher) strength than carbon steel and good corrosion resistance at lower cost. That is why, lately, they have been more often used in structural components. In this paper, attention is first paid to the advantages associated with the use of stainless steel in recent construction projects in view of sustainability. Second, life cycle analysis and the background of the new European standard EN 15804 are introduced, including module D, which allows credits to be taken now for the eventual reuse or recycling of material in the future, at the end-of-life stage. Life cycle inventories of stainless steel products (cold-rolled coils and quarto plate) are presented.

By combining these, we have developed new kinematical systems of which three were selected for the scope of this paper: deployable grids, active bending kit-ofparts systems and pliable textile hybrids. These will be discussed in more detail and applied on a first design case, illustrating the potential applicability in a real case.

Composite steel-concrete structural systems are very popular for medium-sized office buildings, but deconstruction and re-use in deference to demolition is difficult because headed stud shear connectors in the composite slab and steel beam flooring system cannot be detached easily, and reuse is virtually impossible. As an alternative, it is proposed that precast concrete panels can be attached to steel beams using pre-tensioned bolts, instead of cast-in-situ floors with pre-welded headed stud connectors. The proposed floor system can be deconstructed by unbolting the precast panels, enabling recyclability of the system and providing significant advantages in a paradigm within the construction industry focussed on low emissions.

It is in such tragic moments that humanitarian organizations have an important task by providing shelter assistance for the affected population. Besides the family shelters that are provided for temporary housing, collective service tents are also necessary for field hospital, community centre, food,.... Although the current family shelters are adequate enough for the emergency use, there is a demand for better collective service tents because (i) the current tents are structurally complex which slows the building process, (ii) the current tents are not adaptable, (iii) after the initial emergency phase, these tents are not reused. The aim of this paper is to investigate a better alternative for collective service tents by using deployable constructions for the first emergency phase after a disaster, and by designing the component as such that they can be reused for a kit-of-part structure for the second phase of the disaster, i.e. the transitional phase. A first preliminary study is presented in this paper where the structural feasibility of the concept is tested. A barrel vault structure of 6m span and a height of 3m composed of scissor elements is modelled in a finite element program. The structure is then designed to fulfil the boundary conditions for the emergency phase. The components of the barrel vault structure are then used to introduce the idea behind the use of some static kit-of-parts structures for the transitional phase. The results are very promising. Together with experts from the field, we are very optimistic about the use of deployable shelters for humanitarian relief in order to propose a construction which can be used for the emergency and transitional phase of disaster relief. © 2014 WIT Press.","Barrel vault; Emergency shelters; Humanitarian relief; Kit-of-part structures; Optimisation; Scissor structure","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Emergency services; Tools; Barrel vault; Building process; Community centres; Emergency shelter; Finite element programs; Humanitarian relief; Optimisations; Transitional phase; Structural optimization; construction method; disaster relief; finite element method; optimization; recycling; structural analysis; structural component; technological development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903163328

The objective was to ascertain whether strut-and-tie model provisions for efficiency factors of bottle-shaped struts in current design codes and the recent literature, originally meant for natural coarse aggregate concrete, can be conservatively applied to recycled concrete aggregate concrete, or not. The results of the re-analysis indicate that the efficiency factors of the natural coarse aggregate as well as the recycled concrete aggregate concrete bottle-shaped struts were comparable and conservative when benchmarked against the predictions of CSA A23.3-04 and an efficiency factor model proposed by the authors. However, both ACI 318-08 and Eurocode 2 gave unsafe efficiency factor predictions for the recycled concrete aggregate as well as the natural coarse aggregate concrete bottle-shaped struts under investigation. This is attributed to the insensitivity of these two codes to strut inclination with adjoining tie(s) and does not per se indicate any inherent inferiority as far as recycled concrete aggregate concrete is concerned.

This paper addresses the approach of the reuse of steel structure without melting which allows for savings in steel mass and the reduction of waste amounts offering moreover an opportunity to avoid environmental burdens related to the recycling process. Recent studies have stressed the technical feasibility of this strategy, which appears particularly effective in those countries in which a building's life is rather short, such as in Japan and US, though its application encounters more difficulties in most European countries, owing to longer building use. Besides stressing the architectural and structural feasibility of the above-mentioned strategy, this research work aims to quantify the mass savings that are achievable in this manner by presenting a real case study set in Italy. It consists in a railway station, which has been designed keeping in mind the partial employment of structural elements recovered from an old industrial building that is no longer in use. To estimate the amount of steel saved, two different structural models for the designed building have been carried out and compared. In the first one, the structure has been designed on the assumption of the reusing of recovered structural elements; in the second one, the same structure has been designed considering the use of new elements only. The final result of the analysis shows that steel reuse allowed for savings of up to 30% of steel. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To achieve this, a number of tools and methodologies have been developed to assist decision making. Life cycle assessment is one of the most acknowledged and widely used methodologies to assess the sustainability of construction works. Its efficient use, however, requires environmental data that in some cases are not yet available. Especially for sectors such as steel construction in which the potential for sustainable development is increased due to the recycling and reuse potential of the material, the lack of such data slows sustainability-related progress down.

Despite its popularity, problems exist in biogas technology, such as low-quality construction, leakage of pipelines, low biogas production, and lack of maintenance. These problems should be identified and analyzed for effective implementation and efficient operation of small-sized biogas systems (SBS). This research applies the fault tree approach (FTA) to identify failures, and evaluate their effects on the operation of SBS from a technical point of view, based on a nationwide field study in Nepal. Ninety-four sets of SBS were selected and sampled in targeted areas. Five subsystems of SBS were defined, including structural components, biogas utilization equipment, piping system, biogas production, and effluent disposal system. Based on the statistical analysis of the 94 targeted cases, the fault probabilities of the five subsystems are 0.67, 0.48, 0.73, 0.26, and 0.64, respectively. The weights of five subsystems are determined by Delphi method and fault probability of SBS is calculated. The results show that faults on piping systems happen most frequently, and that proper disposal and reuse of bio-slurry are often neglected. Regardless of the social and economic benefits of SBS, implementation scenarios of SBS throughout Nepal are evaluated under a technical perspective, as follows: (1) the operational status of SBS is not optimal. (2) Based on criteria for failures, well-operation ratio is about 53% in practice. (3) Skilled masons are prerequisites for efficient functioning of SBS. (4) Maintenance plays a key role for efficient functioning. The study results prove that FTA is mostly suitable for SBS evaluation and is an effective analysis tool for technical evaluation in the field of biogas technology. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Delphi method; Fault tree approach; Nepal; Small-sized biogas system; Technical assessment","Decision making; Maintenance; Piping systems; Biogas systems; Delphi method; Fault-trees; Nepal; Technical assessment; Biogas; biogas; failure analysis; functional role; maintenance; piping; probability; slurry; waste disposal; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84884715427

The pier's rehabilitation design and subsequent construction posed many challenges, none the least of which was its remote location in the West Central Pacific Ocean. Included in the design considerations was the requirement to provide a ""building blocks"" design to best facilitate the potential construction by the U.S. Navy Seabees, as well as to account for the inherent difficulties of on-site fabrication and to make optimum use of prefabricated elements to enhance constructability. Due to the nature of the available funding and the desire to achieve sustainable design goals, maximizing reuse of all acceptable existing construction played a role, all the while satisfying the stated desire to improve facility configuration and capacity to better serve the mission and the operations of the Missile Defense Command. Furthermore, there was the mandate to provide a design that would afford a minimum 75-year service life for the new facility and have minimal overall environmental impact. This led to a number of innovative design considerations that included specially formulated, high-strength, galvanized reinforced, precast concrete components; employing galvanized structural steel construction with a ""forgiving"" system of connections to best facilitate the arrangement of the existing piling being retained; a carefully controlled dredging and spoils collection scenario to best accommodate future vessel operations and avoid adverse impact on the sensitive surrounding marine environment; a sophisticated spill containment system that would afford the required environmental protection but require minimal maintenance from installation forces; and a concerted effort to maximize the use of recycled and local resources.

In situ investigations should aim to collect data about many aspects of the structure: general geometry and details of single members, internal joints, and metal reinforcements; wooden species and defects; evidences of decay; deformations or displacements; but also relation with other structural elements or systems, signs of timber processing, indications of the reuse of materials, etc. All the gathered data should allow an interpretation of the gradual change in time of the structure's physical reality, of its technological conception and of its structural behaviour since the original design by the carpenter or engineer, through the subsequent works or ""natural"" evolutions, unto the current state. © (2013) Trans Tech Publicutions, Switzerland.","In situ investigation; State of preservation; Survey; Timber roofs; Timber trusses","Existing structure; In-situ investigations; Modern structures; Structural behaviour; Structural elements; Timber processing; Timber roofs; Timber structures; Surveying; Surveys; Timber",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886394977

The model attempts to maximize the system throughput by exploiting opportunistic coding opportunities through appropriate routing and by achieving efficient spectrum reuse through appropriate link scheduling. We assume centralized scheduling at the base station and focus on minimizing the total schedule length to satisfy a certain traffic demand. Minimizing the schedule length is equivalent to maximizing the system throughput. We present a linear programming optimization model for the joint problem, which relies on the enumeration of all possible schedules. Given its complexity, we decompose the problem using a column generation approach. Our numerical results show that significant gains may be achieved when network coding is incorporated into the design.

Thanks to these strong and ultimate lightweight structure materials, burdens imposed by vehicles on environment nowadays could be significantly relieved. However, speedy manufacturing and recycle technology have to be established to apply to mass-production of automobiles using CFRP components. It is estimated that 3,000 t of CFRP scrap being generated annually in Europe and the USA. Some 6,000-8,000 commercial planes are expected to reach end-of-life dismantlement by 2030 (McConnell in Reinf Plast 54(2):33-37, 2010). Historically, CFRP waste has been disposed of in landfills. Since 2004, most European countries have banned the landfill disposal of CFRP waste. Future EU regulations will be imposed on the recycling of end-of-life aircraft along the same lines as those for scrapped vehicles. Besides, high cost of the carbon fibers is likely to be one of the strongest drivers for recycling of CFRP waste if an economic and environmentally friendly technology can be developed to provide a potential sustainable resource of reusable fibers. Numerous recycling approaches have been proposed and investigated: microwave treatment (Lester et al. in Mater Res Bull 39(10):1549-1556, 2004), vacuum pyrolysis (Cunliffe et al. in J Anal Appl Pyrol 70(2):315-338, 2003), chemical solvolysis (Piñero-Hernanz et al. in J Supercrit Fluids 46(1):83-92, 2008; Goto in J Supercrit Fluids 47(3):500-507, 2009), as well as hydro-thermolysis (Piñero-Hernanz et al. in Compos A 39(3):454-461, 2008). Steam thermolysis, a combination of vacuum pyrolysis and mild gasification, has been studied in our laboratory. The process takes place under medium temperatures (until 600 °C) and atmospheric pressure. By using superheated steam as a soft oxidant, the polymer matrix can be converted into lower molecular weight hydrocarbons, CO and CO2 without seriously reducing the mechanical properties of the carbon fiber reinforcement. The steam-thermolysis has been studied and confirmed efficient in treating epoxy based CFRP materials at bench scale. In order to optimize the process, an experimental design has been carried out by using Taguchi method at semi-industrial scale. Initially, an orthogonal array testing was applied to determine the potential influence of the operational parameters on the decomposition rate of the polymer matrix as wall as on the mechanical property of the reclaimed carbon fibers. Three operational parameters at two levels each (target temperature, isothermal dwell time and steam flow-rate) were identified and tested. During the test, some 100 g epoxy based CFRP scrap samples were loaded into a thermal reactor preheated till desired temperature. The steam is flushed with a flow of nitrogen throughout the test to avoid oxidative side reactions. Additional tests were also conducted to complete and validate the results. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CFRP; Epoxy resin; Experimental design; Recycling; Steam-thermolysis","Carbon fiber reinforced; Environmentally-friendly technology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Microwave treatment; Operational parameters; Parameter optimization; Steam-thermolysis; Sustainable resources; Atmospheric pressure; Carbon dioxide; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Computer software reusability; Design of experiments; Epoxy resins; Land fill; Life cycle; Mechanical properties; Optimization; Plates (structural components); Polymer matrix composites; Radioactive waste disposal; Recycling; Scrap metal reprocessing; Solvents; Statistics; Taguchi methods; Vacuum; Waste disposal; Steam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875711892

The laboratory tests of the members were preceded by initial investigations of the structure before disassembling. Some members were repaired and reshaped because of the local damages which occurred during dismantling. The research program assumed that the girders were loaded only with local loading, whereas the slabs were loaded with the uniformly distributed, linear and local loading. All tests which were carried out prove that these elements, despite their age, are in good condition and can be used again in other structures.","Environmental design; Laboratory testing; Precast elements; Reuse; Sustainable construction","Concretes; Environmental design; Prestressed concrete; Reinforced concrete; Slags; Complex procedure; Laboratory testing; Precast elements; Research programs; Reuse; Structural elements; Sustainable construction; Usability assessment; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015610528

It was concluded that the points related to the structural credits are roughly proportional to the cost of structural elements in buildings. However, participation of structural engineers in the sustainability efforts is disproportionally low based on the percentage of structural engineers holding LEED Accredited Professionals (LEED AP) designation. Embodied and total energy requirements of typical buildings were examined and it was concluded that embodied energy in the structural components has a share ranging from 2% for traditional buildings to 25% for net-zero buildings. Finally, the sustainability aspects related to structural design that are currently ignored in the rating systems were identified and discussed. Such aspects include: baseline material usage, structural robustness and resilience to disasters, structural adaptability and reuse, structural durability and longevity. It was emphasised that a structure can be sustainable, in true spirit of the terminology, without achieving significant points in the rating systems as long it satisfies the guiding principle of reducing burden on natural resources and the environment. © Institution of Engineers Australia, 2013.","Embodied energy; Green buildings; Rating systems; Structural durability; Structural engineers; Structural robustness; Sustainable development","Buildings; Durability; Engineers; Planning; Rating; Structural design; Sustainable development; Embodied energy; Green buildings; Rating system; Structural durability; Structural engineer; Structural robustness; Environmental design",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886234349

As one of the most important considerations, fire-resistance design of high strength steel structures requires understanding on material behaviour of high strength structural steels in fire. Provided collapse does not occur when a steel structure is exposed to fire, it needs reliable evaluation after fire to decide whether the steel structure can be reused or not. Reliable evaluation requires accurate material behaviour of steels after fire. However in literature reports on material behaviour of high strength structural steels under fire condition are very few, and the condition is much worse for reports on material behaviour of high strength structural steels after fire. In order to reveal more information on material behaviour of high strength structural steel S460 both in fire and after fire, an experimental research has been carried out.

Linear static, free vibration and nonlinear dynamic time domain analyses are performed for both isolated and non-isolated buildings under site specific bi-directional earthquake. The automated Newmark-beta time integration approach has been adopted for solution in time domain. The nonlinearities, arising due to base isolated bearings and seismic forces are duly considered. The study reveals that for medium rise building construction, isolation can significantly reduce seismic response in soft to medium stiff soil. The reduction of overturning base moment due to isolation indicates that the building becomes more stable compared to the fixed base structure. Modelled non-linear bearings have been found to be suitable to cope with the precise nonlinearities. The building experiences more flexibility even when using the same structural element configuration. In addition, the flexibility of the structure envisages some sort of savings due to reduced structural responses through incorporation of the isolator. In seismic vulnerable areas where the main concern is the mitigation of the seismic instability with the support of critical components, the study shows the effectiveness of the base isolation system in terms of lessening structural responses under seismic loading. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

It provides novel and potentially game changing mass reduction and reuse, along with additional structural advantages over current mechanical life support hardware, structural materials, and radiation protection functions. The approach would allow water recycling, air treatment, thermal control, and solids residuals treatment and recycling to be removed from the usable habitat volume, and placed in the walls by way of a radiation shielding water wall. It would also provide a mechanism to recover and reuse water treatment (solids) residuals to strengthen the habitat shell. Water wall treatment elements would be a much-enlarged version of the commercially available hydration bag. Some water bags would have pervaporation membranes facing inward, which would provide the ability to remove H2O, CO2 and trace organics from the atmosphere.

The FAST AFGE program is an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) project focused on demonstrating the integration of composite structures technologies for application on future space launch vehicle airframes. Technology advancement of integrated composite structures is being performed by development and testing of an integrated airframe ground test article to reduce risks for future responsive access to space. The FAST AFGE test article consists of a liner-less, load bearing, composite cryogenic propellant tank with an integral common bulkhead and integral skirts. The composite propellant tank serves as the airframe fuselage and is integrated with lifting surfaces, thrust structure, thermal protection, and structural health monitoring capability. The primary focus of this paper includes a mass properties assessment for the major composite structural components of the AFGE integrated test article, the common bulkhead tank and the wing box carry-through structure. Structural design details are summarized including predicted mass properties of the major structural components compared to measured weights. Test article weights are used to derive total airframe mass properties for a Reference Flight System (RFS) reusable booster as a measure of structural efficiency.

The causes are multiple: the displacements due to the ""spoils of war"", ordered by kings and emperors, the movements caused by the need for reuse, especially in the early Christian period, and so forth. Considerations about the events of the past, yield a possible strategy to transform this concept into a technique for earthquake prevention of archaeological sites. The seismic safety retrofits have often proven to be scarcely effective, because of the difficulties involved in complex sites. The aim of this study is to analyze an ""alternative"" method of preventing natural disaster like floods, eruption and earthquakes, through the movimentation of the most representative structural elements of archaeological sites by decomposition of the masonry and marbles [1]. The procedure considers a process of ""cutting optimization,"" calibrated on the characteristics of the specific material that has to be cut and then displaced in safer places (i.e., MEP, ""manufact evacuation plan""). This process should not create excessive problems to the structure, and aims to reassembly the manufact in contexts able to guarantee safety through advanced earthquake-resistant expedients. From these considerations, the work develops a procedure to safeguard the archaeological site of Pompei (Naples), through an appropriate analysis of representative portions of the site, aimed to a careful handling and to a proper reconstruction in a safe location, from the seismic point of view. © Cennamo et al.","Archaeological sites; Seismic protection; Stone cutting","Archaeological site; Christians; Complex sites; Earthquake prevention; Evacuation plans; Natural disasters; Reassembly; Safer places; Seismic protection; Seismic safety; Site to sites; Specific materials; Stone cutting; Structural elements; Earthquakes; Optimization; Retrofitting; Safe handling; Disaster prevention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855501757

The surface of the GNPs was modified with a mixed (1:9) SAM of 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) and 3-mercapto-propionic acid (MPA). The enzyme, uricase was covalently immobilized to the carboxyl groups of the mixed SAM of MUA/MPA through carbodiimide coupling reaction. The whole assembly was constructed on 1 cm2 area of ITO-glass plate and was tested as an amperometric biosensor for the detection of uric acid in aqueous solution. The biosensor assembly was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrochemical techniques. The AFM of the enzyme biosensor assembly reveals an asymmetrical sharp regular island-like structure with an average roughness parameter value of 2.81 nm. Chronoamperometric response was measured as a function of uric acid concentration in aqueous solution (pH 7.4), which exhibits a linear response over a concentration range of 0.07 to 0.63 mM with a sensitivity of 19.27 μAmM -1 and a response of 25 s with excellent reproducibility. These results are not influenced by the presence of interfering reagents such as ascorbic acid, urea and glucose.

This study proposes a system for membrane based water, solids and air treatment functions that is embedded into the walls of inflatable habitat structures to provide potentially radical mass reuse and structural advantages over current mechanical life support hardware operating within rigid habitat envelopes. This approach would allow part of the water and air treatment, and all of the solids residuals treatment and recycle, to be removed from the usable habitat volume while providing a mechanism to recover and reuse water treatment residuals (solids) to strengthen the habitat shell, provide thermal control, and radiation shielding. The same embedded membrane treatment elements would first for a time provide primary (1st stage) wastewater treatment, then provide solids accumulation and stabilization, and finally become a permanent structural element for the mature habitat shell. Secondary air treatment membrane elements similarly located are also briefly considered as potential future additions to the treatment architecture. The technology used is not speculative but is based on established emergency water recovery technology being used in the Light Weight Contingency - Water Recovery Apparatus (LWC-WRS), Direct Osmotic Concentration (DOC) but in a scaled up version. As such all hardware proposed is based on commercial off the shelf products and materials, and the 1st stage water treatment is well demonstrated and documentation indicates better than 90% water recovery as a first stage treatment for hygiene water and urine. Thus, the proposed technology is based upon proven engineering solutions that will be analytically demonstrated to potently serve a much larger role in future space architecture. In addition it should be noted that the concept of using a water wall for thermal and radiation shielding is the current baseline assumption for planetary base habitats and rovers. © 2010 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Considering the change on the demand for resource utilization it is important to prepare different types of recycling methods and leave a chance to choose the best recycling method according to the situation of the society and the environment. Almost 50 years ago salvaged lumbers were commonly used as structural materials for the post and beam single detached houses in Japan. If we can tell the strength properties of the salvaged lumbers we can use them as structural elements for the wooden houses. And if we can take a little more care and spent more time on deconstruction we can produce higher quality salvaged lumbers from the deconstruction site. On the other hand recycling and reusing wood based materials will help keep storing carbon as materials. This will work as to reduce carbon discharge caused by burning the materials and to reduce the movement toward global warming. The purpose of this study is to prepare technical information for the salvaged lumbers and draft a standard for the reclaimed two-by-four lumbers. Almost 1000 pieces of salvaged lumbers were tested for their visual grades, structural defects and physical characteristics. And almost 300 pieces of salvaged lumbers were tested for their tension strength properties. The test results can be summarized as follows. The strength value for the salvaged lumbers was 4.76(N/mm2). The calculated design value for the salvaged lumbers was almost equivalent to that of the grade ""Standard"" and was lower than their original grade ""No.2"". The strength value of the salvaged lumbers that was visually graded as S-P-F No.2 was 6.20(N/mm2) and was 1.5(N/mm2) higher than the strength values calculated for the group of all salvaged lumbers. But the yield ratio became to be 68.7% by selecting the lumbers. The strength value of the salvaged lumbers that have MOE no less than 9.6(GPa) was 6.70(N/mm) and the yield ratio was 84%.

Treatment of a model dairy wastewater (diluted skim milk) by nanofiltration (NF) with a rotating disk membrane (RDM) module was investigated using a NF membrane NF270 (Dow-Filmtec). Compared with the Desal-5 DK (Ge-Osmonics) membrane studied previously, the NF270 membrane gave much higher permeate flux, but same rejection. At a high enough shear rate for reducing concentration polarization, permeate flux and solutes rejection increased while specific energy per m3 of permeate decreased when transmembrane pressure (TMP) rose from 10 to 40bar. Because the RDM module could produce very high shear rates, concentration of dairy wastewater by NF could be operated under extreme hydraulic conditions that combined extreme TMP with high shear rate. Process efficiency and permeate quality were improved by operating under these condition, while membrane fouling was a little higher than when operating below critical flux. A real dairy wastewater was also treated by NF270 under same hydraulic conditions, and results were very similar to those of model solution. Membrane fouling was decreased by raising pH above 9. Irreversible fouling was almost removed using a commercial cleaning agent at high shear rate in a short time. The RDM module appeared to be a suitable technology to treat dairy waste without any biological and chemical treatments. Permeate qualities were suitable for reuse or discharge in river. These results from laboratory-scale tests can be very useful in the analysis of membrane process under extreme hydraulic conditions and can serve as valuable guide for process design in industrial application. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Effluent; Milk; Nanofiltration; Shear rate; Water reuse","Bio-hydrogen production; Chemical treatments; Cleaning agents; Concentration polarization; Critical flux; Dairy wastes; Dairy wastewater; Feed supplement; High concentration; High shear rate; Hydraulic conditions; Irreversible fouling; Laboratory scale; Membrane process; Milk; Model solution; NF membranes; Osmonics; Permeate flux; Permeate quality; Process efficiency; Retentate; Shear rates; Skim milks; Specific energy; Transmembrane pressures; Water reuse; Agricultural wastes; Animals; Computer software reusability; Dairies; Disks (structural components); Effluents; Germanium; Hydraulics; Industrial applications; Membrane fouling; Membrane technology; Nanofiltration; Process engineering; Rotating disks; Rotation; Shear deformation; Thermomechanical pulping process; Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water supply; Wheels; Water filtration; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956648491

In order to conserve water, it has been proposed to use greywater for irrigational purposes. If this was the case, greywater would travel straight from the house to outside for use, minimizing the need for installing pipelines and such to carry the water elsewhere. However the widespread use of a variety of antibacterial and there subsequent presence in greywater raises concerns regarding impact on environment and health. Our research looked at the possible modification of microbial communities within the soil due to the presence of a commonly used antibacterial agent, triclosan. Along with the community structure, we also looked at any antibiotic resistance due to the constant exposure to triclosan. This experiment involved of three groups: control, greywater only and greywater with triclosan. Each group consisted of four soil filled columns treated with their designated solutions on a weekly basis. The effluent was collected from each column and cultured onto plates. Isolates were then taken from the plates for further testing. Our findings show that under constant exposure, the community structure did, in fact, change showing two very distinct heterotrophic populations between those that were treated with triclosan and those that were not. It was also seen that due to the exposure to triclosan, resistance to the four tested antibiotics (ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin and tetracycline) increases. Our results indicate that triclosan in greywater can have significant impacts on soil microbes. The changing of the microbial community structure could lead to a change in available nutrients and the form those nutrients are found. While the antibacterial products may be present in very minute concentrations, their constant presence may be selecting for bacteria that are resistant to all types of antibiotics, thus making it harder to treat. It is possible that all this is avoidable by treating the greywater before using it or by removing antibacterial products. In congruence with our data, there is a need for further investigation. © 2010 ASCE.","Residential location; Wastewater management; Water reclamation","Antibacterial agent; Antibiotic resistance; Community structures; Greywater; Household wastewater; Microbial communities; Microbial community structures; Residential locations; Significant impacts; Soil microbes; Triclosan; Wastewater management; Water reclamation; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Effluents; Nutrients; Plates (structural components); Sewage; Social sciences; Soils; Wastewater; Wastewater reclamation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954948780

In comparable scenarios, where predicates of the metamodel share structural elements and rules are syntactically and semantically similar, the use of hierarchies and a particular form of polymorphism provide significant advantages.

Seven types of shear connectors have been developed and tested: lag screws, either alone or combined with a notch cut from each timber joist; metal plates embedded in the concrete slab and either nailed or glued to the joists; dowels embedded in the concrete and glued to the timber; and toothed metal plates embedded in the concrete and pressed into the timber. Four-point bending tests to failure were performed on five, full-scale, 4.8 m long specimens connected with lag screws or metal plates nailed to the timber. Values of deflection and relative slip between the concrete slab and the timber obtained in these tests showed high correspondence with values obtained from a uniaxial finite element model developed for nonlinear analyses of composite beams. The model was also used to perform a numerical analysis to failure of composite beams with the other four connection systems that were developed but not tested on full-scale specimens. The outcomes of the experimental tests and numerical analyses show that the newly developed system can provide good structural performance, especially if connections with coach screws and notches in the timber are used. The economic advantages of prefabrication and the possibility to disassemble the structure and reuse the timber beams and concrete panels at the end of the service life make the proposed floor system very promising. © 2010 ASCE.","Composite structures; Connectors; Precast concrete; Prefabrication; Timber construction; Wood","Composite beam; Composite floors; Concrete panels; Economic advantages; Experimental test; Finite element models; Floor systems; Four-point bending test; Laboratory test; Metal plates; Prefabricated concrete slabs; Relative slip; Shear connector; Structural performance; Timber beam; Timber construction; Timber joists; Timber-concrete composites; Bending tests; Composite beams and girders; Concrete blocks; Concrete slabs; Failure analysis; Floors; Gluing; Numerical analysis; Plates (structural components); Precast concrete; Quality assurance; Screws; Structure (composition); Testing; Wooden construction; Timber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-73449091543

Such a restructuring is carried out by introducing hierarchies and, consequently, extending Datalog by providing it with inheritance and polymorphism in order to take advantage of them. In comparable scenarios, where predicates of the metamodel share structural elements and rules are syntactically and semantically similar, the use of hierarchies and a particular form of polymorphism provide significant advantages. These advantages range from simplifying the specification of elementary and complete translations (i.e. Datalog rules and programs, respectively) to ensuring a higher level of reuse for them, thus further improving the development of such rule-based systems.",,"Database systems; Datalog; Extended abstracts; Meta model; Model management; Rule-based system; Structural elements; Computer software reusability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890962577

The main goal of our approach is to provide a new software provision mode as convenient and flexible as that in the tool-toolbox model so as to reduce software management cost and to improve software reusability at a finer granularity in local or distributed virtual machine environments. With our approach, the traditional one-piece large-sized virtual disk image is split into a Base Virtual Disk (BVD) image and multiple small-sized Software Virtual Disk (SVD) images at a basic granularity of a single kind of software. By applying a file system metadata extraction (FSME) approach, most SVDs can be made fully independent. Only the small-sized SVDs installed with user-required software are distributed to users and are made usable/unusable by performing low-cost SVD operations at user sides, which could greatly reduce the software deployment cost. We have built a working prototype based on QEMU virtual machine monitor (VMM) and ext2 file system on Linux system.

Tall steel building frames are subjected to substantially high lateral forces due to wind and/or earthquake, in addition to the usual dead and live loads. The cost of construction of such frames can be reduced by providing additional structural steel members, called bracings, between suitable pairs of nodes of the building. The patterns generated from a CA-LFSR, tuned to the structural configuration of a building, dictates the desired positions of bracings resulting in a structure with reduced construction cost. The cost optimal design developed around the CA-LFSR is reached in constant time that is possible with the conventional design procedure based on the principles of structural engineering. Exhaustive experimentation establish that the proposed CA-LFSR based approach is most effective for the design of tall building frames, and can reuse a design for scalability. ©2009 IEEE.","Bracing system; CA - LFSR; Cellular automata; Steel building frame","Bracing system; Bracing systems; Constant time; Construction costs; Conventional design procedures; Cost-optimal design; Desired position; Galois extension; Lateral force; Live loads; Steel buildings; Structural configurations; Structural engineering; Structural steels; Building materials; Cellular automata; Cost reduction; Machine design; Optimal systems; Optimization; Pattern recognition systems; Robots; Steel; Tall buildings; Three dimensional; Translation (languages); Shift registers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949628242

The importance of changing traditionally adopted attitudes (such as the discard of used materials components for recycling and reuse practices) in order to create a more sustainable production model is presented in the literature. The aim of this exploratory paper is to analyze major social, economical and legal factors, which can act as barriers or opportunities in the reuse of building components. The research strategy employed is a single-embedded case study. The main unit of analysis is the reuse process, investigated by the study of the demolition sector in the city of Porto Alegre (Brazil). The process is characterized; its main phases and agents are presented and described. The supply chain management (SCM) approach is used to model the reuse process. The article summarizes major factors, which influence the reuse process, pointed in the literature and compares those with the case study findings enabling the identification of some differences. The case study findings suggest that the reuse of building components is primarily supported by economical and social aspects such as the labor cost of deconstruction and demand for reused products. Although legal mechanisms may play an important role in promoting the reuse of building components, its potential was not observed in the case study. The article also provides a critical analysis of the current state of construction waste management in Porto Alegre on issues like legislation and responsibilities, considering recent changes in national regulations. Finally, the adoption of the SCM approach has showed to be useful for the analysis of ""close loop"" supply chains as it enabled the identification of additional factors that can influence the reuse process. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper discusses the use of climate data collection software, heat loss and heat gain considerations and software; how to achieve a zero energy building and qualifying as a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Certified Platinum home. Site selection is the first step. This first step can be taken after you have identified your goals. What alternative energy systems do you want to use? Do you want to use more than one alternative source? What other site considerations are important? In my case, I wanted to use solar energy as my primary alternative energy source. Why? I want comfort, reliability and ease of use. Other alternatives may require more maintenance. Wind power will be a second source that will be incorporated to produce electricity when the PV system can not produce. The site selected is a south facing mountain that has a steady breeze most of the time. Another consideration for me is the ability to use earth-sheltering as a measure of high efficiency construction. The south-facing mountain also provides the opportunity to ""nestle"" into the mountainside. Calculations and basis of design are presented. Using less is a key mindset that we all need to move toward. Using less does not mean that you suffer. This house will be comfortable year round with little effort because the house uses passive solar design for lighting and space heating, active solar hot water for additional heating of the floor and domestic hot water, and PV/wind/biodiesel generator backup to generate electricity for lighting and other typical electrical loads. The construction materials provide high R-values and green products that contribute to excellent indoor air quality. SIPs (Structural Insulated Panels) will be used as the structural components for the walls and roof. All electrical appliances, refrigerator, lighting, and washer/dryer were selected to use less electricity and water. Data describing the energy requirements are provided. Reuse all that you can. I am incorporating a masonry heater, also known as a Russian Fireplace. The combustion efficiency of the masonry fireplace is typically 92-94 percent with very low emissions. The masonry fireplace will provide passive mass for passive release of the woodburning energy during the evening and heat hot water coils in the fireplace as well (as the hot water backup system). The use of hard woods from the land will provide heat overnight, heat for cooking and supply additional BTUs for domestic hot water and radiant heat. Many of the building materials that are selected for construction are from the land; stone and whole cut wood from the land will be used for esthetic appeal and thermal mass thereby reducing harmful manufacturer's emissions. My site is an excellent site for a hybrid solar and wind power (with a biodiesel generator as backup) system. The orientation and wind profile of the land is optimal for solar and wind energy applications. Site specific data and optimization of active solar, passive solar and PV/wind systems are presented. Life cycle costs are presented to show the cost comparison using Years-to-Payback and Return on Investment approaches for the energy systems and LEED certification costs for new construction.

Examples presented in this paper where these principles were successfully implemented include (a) the retention and reuse of existing bridge substructure elements; (b) the reuse of an existing bridge as a temporary detour crossing; and (c) the innovative combination of cast-in-place concrete and mechanically stabilized earth walls in stacked and tiered arrangements. As a commitment to local residents in Squamish, noise mitigation measures were provided through the urban Squamish corridor. This was achieved in part through the use of open-graded friction course (OGFC) pavement. The coarser gradation and increased air voids of OGFC pavement have noted noise reduction features and improved safety features but require special attention to bridge deck surface drainage and pavement finishing.",,"Climate change; Environmental impact; Noise abatement; Pavements; Local residents; Mechanically stabilized earth wall; Noise mitigation; Open-graded friction course; Structural concept; Structural elements; Surface drainage; Tiered arrangement; Cast in place concrete",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896956349

The RTCASS Toolbox translates CASS Abbreviated Test Language for All Systems (ATLAS) to a format compatible with the RTCASS runtime. The L200 Auto-Converter uses Teradyne's TPS Converter Studio™ to translate CASS Digital Test Language and CASS Digital Automatic Test Program Generation (DATPG) associated files (patterns, timing sets, levels, pinmaps, etc) to C source code for use with the Teradyne M9-Series Digital Test Instrument (DTI). The process for CASS to RTCASS migration requires Virtual Address eXtension (VAX) Digital Command Language (DCL) scripting files to compile ATLAS and L-Series files and transfer data from VAX or ALPHA to the PC platform. Transferred data is expected to be stored in a pre-defined directory structure, to be translated later on. The translators complete the process by displaying any errors that must be corrected and warning of potential problems. Processes associated with error corrections and methods to create CASS Fleet Deliverable Disks (also known as Blue Disks) led the In-Service Support Center (ISSC) Jacksonville, FL to create an additional set of tools that automate PC scripting and generation of VAX DCL command files. The ISSC Jacksonville tool set eliminates the manual processes that are costly, time consuming, and increase the probability of error if not done properly. The most common problems include Test Program Sets (TPS) with corrupted .dat files used for the Master Test Program Set Index (MTPSI), corrupted VAX backup save set files and corrupted or missing CASS L-Series stimulus and response pattern files. This paper demonstrates how the ISSC Jacksonville tool set provides solutions to the challenges faced in the CASS to RTCASS translation process. The tools were created for four reasons: 1) speed data transfer rate, 2) minimize user interaction, 3) increase reusability and portability of eXtensive Markup Language (XML) configuration files and 4) automate generation of PC and VAX DCL scripts. ©2008 IEEE.","Automation tools; CASS to RTCASS migration; CASS to RTCASS Test Program Sets (TPS) modification process; Operational Test Program Sets (OTPS) XML configuration; TPS re-host; VAX/VMS DCL","Automation; Data transfer; Data transfer rates; Disks (machine components); Disks (structural components); Error correction; Heat shielding; Hypertext systems; Light weight rolling stock; Linguistics; Markup languages; Microstrip devices; Military operations; Reusability; Test facilities; Testing; Translation (languages); XML; Automation tools; CASS to RTCASS migration; CASS to RTCASS Test Program Sets (TPS) modification process; Operational Test Program Sets (OTPS) XML configuration; TPS re-host; VAX/VMS DCL; Automatic programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57949113962

This in turn helps them to allocate resources. Software cost estimation has been an area of key interest in software engineering community. Many estimation models divided among various categories have been proposed over a period of time. Function Point (FP) is one of the useful software cost estimation methodology that was first proposed twenty-five years ago using the project repository that contained information about various aspects of software project. In the last twenty five years software development productivity has grown rapidly but the complexity weight metrics values assigned to count standard FP still remain same. This fact raises critical questions about the validity of the complexity weight values and accuracy of the estimation process. The objective of this work is to present a genetic algorithm based approach to calibrate the complexity weight metrics of FP using the project repository of International Software Benchmarking Standards Group (ISBSG) dataset.

It is considered as a promising way to improve software development productivity and quality. However, component reuse success is widely related to other activities such as the localization of components satisfying developer requirements. Current approaches for components retrieval are mostly limited to specific components (software components, source code, etc). To go beyond the limits of these approaches, we propose a structural and behavioral retrieval technique that takes in account the heterogeneity of the components repository (abstraction level, technology, domain, etc). The basic notion of our approach is to combine formal and semiformal specification used to describe component and then to make the retrieval process more efficient. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Software engineering; Abstraction levels; Component reuse; Retrieval process; Semi-formal specifications; Software communities; Software components; Software development; Software reuse; Source codes; Specific components; Structural components; Computer software reusability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61649109331

The converter has been adapted to the process-related thermal load by utilizing the tried and tested lamella suspension system; the design of an optimized clearance between trunnion ring and converter vessel; and by using high-grade, heat-resistant, fine-grained structural steels. Sufficient cooling is ensured solely by the natural thermal draught. The mounting space has been utilized in the best possible way, which is why it has been possible to extend the converter vessel size to a maximum and considerably increase the specific volume at a given tapping weight as compared with the previous design concept. A novel assembly and installation concept, using special vehicles and suitable hydraulic lifting, turning and shifting equipment, and including the removal and smooth reinstallation of part of a platform, was implemented. This has decreased the typical revamp time for converters of this size. Accurate balancing of the torques of the converter and trunnion ring has allowed for the reuse of the existing converter drive assembly. The blowing process in the new converter vessel is much calmer than before, the blowing time has been reduced, and the lives of refractories and blowing lances have been extended. Moreover, the quality of the recovered converter offgas could be improved.

This paper presents two compiler-directed approaches to improving the I/O performance of data-intensive applications: code restructuring for disk reuse maximization and adaptive I/O prefetching. The compiler-directed code restructuring improves I/O performance by reducing the number of disk accesses through increasing disk reuse. That is, the data in a given set of disks are reused as much as possible before moving onto other disks. Adaptive I/O prefetching, on the other hand, is motivated by the observation that the effectiveness of compiler-directed I/O prefetching reduces significantly due to harmful prefetches when multiple CPUs share the same set of disks. To reduce intra- and inter-CPU harmful prefetches, our adaptive I/O prefetching scheme obtains inter-thread data sharing patterns through profiling and, based on the extracted sharing patterns, divides the threads into clusters and assigns a dedicated I/O prefetcher thread to each cluster. Our experimental results clearly show that both these approaches improve the I/O performance dramatically over the conventional data locality oriented schemes and compiler-directed I/O prefetching schemes. ©2008 IEEE.",,"I/O performance; Pre-fetching; Chlorine compounds; Codes (symbols); Computer networks; Disks (machine components); Distributed parameter networks; Encoding (symbols); Industrial economics; Disks (structural components)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51049110958

Especially for the fabrication of nuclear components, various codes and technical requirements were designated in design specifications. However most SWPSs issued by AWS could not meet and conflict with the technical requirements such as impact tests and IGC tests.

At present in Korea, 20 units have been operated and maintained, and most recently several units were under construction and planned to be constructed. The main reactor type of nuclear power plants is PWR (pressurized light-water cooled reactor), therefore most of technical requirements used for welding process were nearly identical and standardized. For those reasons, the development of new SWPS which contains additional requirements such as impact tests and IGC tests, is relatively easy and feasible.

Fully programmable and string based, Tcl is ideal for implementing live load analysis through scripts and experimenting with emergent bridge rating methodologies. Since Tcl is an interpreted language, the application also has the important advantage that new bridge capacity models and rating factor calculations can be implemented quickly by a user without compiling source code. The rating application is demonstrated on a conventionally reinforced concrete bridge girder. The use of OpenSees for finite-element analysis makes the rating application readily extensible to nonlinear structural response and advanced structural reliability methods for a variety of a bridge types and structural components. © 2008 ASCE.","Bridge maintenance; Computer aided simulation; Computer programming; Live loads; Ratings; Structural analysis","bridge capacity; Bridge ratings; Finite element analysis (FEA); Finite element software (MARC2000); Load analysis; Nonlinear structural response; Reinforced concrete (RC) bridges; Scripting languages; Source coding; Structural components; Structural reliability methods; Bridges; Building materials; Composite beams and girders; Concrete construction; Linguistics; Nonlinear analysis; Quality assurance; Reinforced concrete; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Reusability; Structural analysis; Finite element method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45749088538

The approvals are typically made on soft proofs of pages whereas, obviously, the images used for plate making are so-called imposed flats (a combination of pages rotated in such a way that the printed matter can be obtained after folding and cutting). The main goal of a soft proof of a page is to simulate accurately on a display device how the page will be finally printed. The quality expectations of a soft proof are very high since a formal approval implies contractual obligations from the printing organization. This quality, however, can be influenced by many parameters. By definition, soft proofs will be displayed on a monitor (being a light emitting device), whereas a print on paper can only be seen as the reflection of a light source. As a consequence, monitors can be described by an additive color model whereas printers or presses will be modeled by a subtractive color model. Other differences relate to how the image is generated: presses can only output binary information (ink or no ink) and continuous tones are simulated by using screening techniques whereas, on a monitor, a multi-level signal can generate different shades of a specific color. The differences described above are addressed by many color management systems available on the market today. An upcoming requirement in this area is that people do not only expect the color management software to behave well but also expect this software to validate its behavior. Another range of problems with soft proofs relates to the rendering (converting vector-based page data into bitmaps) and separation process. These can be divided in two classes: spatial issues (related to resolution differences, high-frequency patterns, aliasing problems etc.) and issues related to object layering (overprint and transparency issues). Also when optimizations are carried out for plate reuse across versioned products, many things can go wrong. In this paper, we will categorize the different potential problems occurring with soft proofs and examine in detail how these problems can be avoided. It will turn out that this can only be realized if one knows the details on how the printing plates will be generated in prepress production. © 2008 SPIE-IS&T.","Approval; Graphic enterprise; Hard copy proofing; Printing industry; Proofing; Soft proofing","Color; Color printing; Curve fitting; Display devices; Food additives; Industrial management; Ink; Light; Light sources; Lighting; Management; Mathematical models; Monitoring; Optics; Paper; Plates (structural components); Presses (machine tools); Printing; Separation; Societies and institutions; Vectors; Well stimulation; (SPM) classes; aliasing problems; binary information; Bitmaps; color imaging; Color management softwares; Color management system (CMS); Color modeling; Contractual obligations; Electronic imaging; High-frequency (HF); In order; Light emitting devices; Monitor (CO); Multi level (ML); p otential problems; plate making; Pre-press; Printed matter; Printing organizations; Production processes; quality expectations; screening techniques; Separation processes; soft proofing; Optical properties",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45549088372

Simulation federates running at different locations are subject to failure. The failure of one federate can lead to the crash of the overall simulation execution. Such risk increases with the scale of a distributed simulation. Hence, fault tolerance is required to support runtime robustness. This paper introduces a framework for robust HLA-based distributed simulations using a ‘Decoupled Federate Architecture’. The framework provides a generic fault-tolerant model, which deals with failure with a dynamic substitution approach. A sender-based method is designed to ensure reliable in-transit message delivery, which is coupled with a novel algorithm to perform effective fossil collection. The fault-tolerant model also avoids any unnecessary repeated computation when handling failure. Using a middleware approach, the framework supports reusability of legacy federate code and it is platform-neutral and independent of federate modeling approaches. Experiments have been carried out to validate and benchmark the fault-tolerant federates using an example of a supply-chain simulation. The experimental results show that the framework provides correct failure recovery. The results also indicate that the framework only incurs minimal overhead for facilitating fault tolerance and has a promising scalability. © 2008, SAGE Publications.

Outsourcing established products and performing initial production of new products in a semi-works or small, flexible facility is one of the best approaches. The best motivation is healthy growth in new or existing business, while growth in an existing business is more likely to be reliable than projections for a new business.

Two zones of the DDS have been in operation since November 2005. The two zones are individually operated to control hydraulic loading rates and disperse either 0.5 or 1.0 cm/d of domestic septic tank effluent (STE) into an Ascalon sandy loam soil 0.2-0.3 m below ground surface. Within each zone, one portion was landscaped with sod while another portion was allowed to naturally vegetate. After an initial few months of startup activities, routine operation commenced in March 2006. Since that time, the drip system has been monitored for operational stability, effluent distribution efficiency, and treatment performance, including a multi-component tracer test. Monitoring data have revealed that the drip system has reliably dispersed the STE applied. The spin disk filter unit was shown to have little effect on the composition of the STE delivered to the drip lines. Data from a tracer test and 3-D coring event revealed that STE moves preferentially along the drip tubing as it infiltrates into the native soil. The addition of STE to the shallow subsurface attenuates the natural variability of pH, water content, and inorganic nitrogen in the soil. In addition, fecal coliform bacteria levels adjacent to the drip lines were very low or non-detectable.","Disk filters; Drip dispersal; Drip irrigation; Nitrogen","Below ground surfaces; Colorado School of Mines; Disk filters; Distribution efficiencies; Drip dispersal; Drip irrigation; Drip lines; Drip systems; Fecal coliform bacteria; Field performances; Hydraulic loading rates; Inorganic nitrogens; Native soils; Natural variabilities; Operational stabilities; Sandy loam soils; Semi-arid; Shallow subsurfaces; Start-up; Test sites; Tracer tests; Treatment performances; Chemical oxygen demand; Coliform bacteria; Disks (structural components); Effluent treatment; Effluents; Irrigation; Radioactive tracers; Septic tanks; Sewage; Soils; System stability; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Water content; Water pollution; Water treatment; Wave filters; Wastewater reclamation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053655517

You can choose two methods to create learning content packages: using the tools on your local disk or using the content creation module of a Learning Management System. If you use tools on your disk, nobody can reach, share and reuse your resource files. If you use a module of an LMS, the products will be reachable only in that LMS. The goal of this study is to produce an interoperable platform called LCDM (Learning Content Design Platform) that supports Multilanguage. LCDM has a ""resources pool"" providing reusability of resources and a ""content packages pool"" providing a search mechanism among the products. LCDM does not depend on any Learning Management System (LMS) but the products are interoperable because the produced content packages can be used in different LMSs that supports Scorm2004 standard. It is a web-based platform for uploading resources, editing metadata information, creating content organizations, packaging the content and searching. Also it is possible to preview both the resource files and resulted packages on a user-friendly interface. The system has many modules for different processes and allows to define new user groups, users and lessons.

While there are several widely used mechanisms for ensuring confidentiality of data in transit, techniques for providing confidentiality when data is stored in a disk subsystem are relatively new. As opposed to prior file system based approaches to this problem, this paper proposes an application-level solution, which allows encryption of select data blocks. We make three major contributions: 1) quantifying the tradeoffs between confidentiality and performance; 2) evaluating a reuse distance oriented approach for selective encryption of disk-resident data; and 3) proposing a profile-guided approach that approximates the behavior of the reuse distance oriented approach. The experiments with five applications that manipulate disk-resident data sets clearly show that our approach enables us to study the confidentiality/performance tradeoffs. Using our approach it is possible to reduce the performance degradation due to encryption/decryption overheads on an average by 46.5%, when DES is used as the encryption mechanism, and the same by 30.63%, when AES is used as the encryption mechanism. © 2007 IEEE.","Data reuse; Encryption; Input/output; Performance; Security","Application level; Data blocks; Data reuse; Data sets; Encryption; Encryption/decryption; End-to-end security; File systems; Input/output; Performance; Performance degradation; Reuse distance; Security; Selective encryption; Storage systems; Cryptography; Disks (structural components); Mechanisms; Sulfate minerals; Security of data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49449091409

In developing countries, the number of bone fractures due to traffic or industrial accidents is high. Patients often need an osteosynthesis with plates and screws, but most patients, however, cannot afford this because of the costs involved and have to rely on the application of used plates and screws. This study aims to determine whether used plates can be safely reused in another patient from a biomechanical, surface physico-chemical, and biological point-of-view. Osteosynthesis plates weakened in a predictable way during use, regardless of the history, presumably because tests were conducted under extreme conditions in the absence of clinically applied load-sharing between bone and plate. Surface physico-chemical analyses indicated that used plates and screws were more hydrophilic than new ones; had increased amounts of calcium-phosphates at their surfaces and possessed higher number of scratches. Pitting corrosion could be seen on SEM micrographs. Simple cleaning methods, as available in developing countries, including toothbrush, water, detergent and bleach yielded elemental surface compositions, and hydrophobicities similar to those of new ones, while biologically thus cleaned screws were not cytotoxic according to ISO-10993-5 and endotoxin release according to USP-27-NF-22 was within the requirements of the FDA. It is concluded that the reuse of osteosynthesis plates and screws are not necessarily unsafe, although preferably a register should be kept of all previous users to limit the number of reuses as mechanical weakening does occur. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Biocompatibility; Biomechanical properties; Fatigue; Reuse of osteosynthesis plates and screws; Surface properties","Biocompatibility; Patient treatment; Physical chemistry; Plates (structural components); Screws; Surface properties; Biomechanical properties; Mechanical weakening; Osteosynthesis plates; Reuse of osteosynthesis plates and screws; Biomechanics; bleaching agent; calcium phosphate; detergent; endotoxin; water; article; biomechanics; bone plate; bone screw; cleaning; corrosion; cytotoxicity test; developing country; food and drug administration; fracture; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; occupational accident; osteosynthesis; physical chemistry; safety; scanning electrochemical microscopy; surface property; toothbrush; traffic accident; Adolescent; Adult; Biocompatible Materials; Bone Plates; Bone Screws; Child; Developing Countries; Equipment Reuse; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Humans; Materials Testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750451977

This interest is driven partly by the recent adoption in Canada of the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) Green Building Rating System and partly by a greater general awareness of environmental issues. Designers are beginning to look at how to incorporate reused steel components into construction projects, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions by saving on primary steel production. However, although some designers are willing to redesign their projects to make use of available reclaimed structural steel components, it is often difficult to identify suitable materials in the local area at the appropriate time in the life of a project. A limiting factor is that designers, construction companies, and others perceive a lack of a well-established and easily available mechanism for exchange of reclaimed components. This paper reviews the issues that are relevant to increasing recycling and reuse in construction and focuses on examples that illustrate the benefits that steel can bring to sustainable construction. In particular, it discusses the issues relevant to designing to enable future disassembly and the way in which steel components can be readily reused. © 2006 NRC Canada.","Design for deconstruction; Reclaimed steel; Reuse of materials; Steel recycling; Sustainable construction","Buildings; Construction industry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Steel structures; Design for deconstruction; Reclaimed steel; Reuse of materials; Steel recycling; Sustainable construction; Steel construction; Buildings; Construction industry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Steel construction; Steel structures; building; design; recycling; steel structure; Canada; North America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747075736

Technological solutions include recycling municipal effluent, which can be treated to a standard suitable for nonpotable uses such as garden watering and toilet flushing. Successful operation of such solutions requires institutional arrangements for long-term management, as well as public awareness and cooperation to establish safe practices. This article reports on research undertaken at four case study sites in Australia and the United States and identifies the social and management issues important to the success of water reuse projects. The cross-national findings demonstrate that best practice in residential water reuse technology should be coupled with institutional and structural arrangements that inform and involve the public and provide transparent governance. It is suggested that this combination of technical and social structural elements will facilitate a sustained trust in, and acceptance of water reuse.

The ultimate objective is to identify an optimum liner and coating design that produces stress and deformation fields leading to improved life/durability. A reference case based on the work of previous studies is introduced and subsequent changes in geometry and materials are investigated. Analyses are accomplished through the application of the cylindrical version of the higher-order theory for functionally graded materials/structural components. This theory provides a unique analytical tool for the design of advanced aircraft engine structural components with active cooling channels based on the concept of functionally graded material architectures through which improved deformation and life can be attained. The sensitivity of the cooling channel wall deformation to changes in the wall thickness is demonstrated which is commensurate with the observed failure mode. Most importantly, the presence of a NiCrAlY thermal barrier coating is shown to substantially reduce the cooling channel wall distortion. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

With respect to the major automation methods, the structure of methods for categorized reusable components, a structural element, and the design of skeletons for batch programming are described. This approach uses (1) input and output component groups, (2) program skeleton groups, and (3) data processing groups for which detailed processes have been turned into components, all in a mutually independent fashion as categorized reusable components for the software to be generated. Then these components are adjusted and a program is generated by combining them together using tools. By making the components independent in this fashion, this approach has the capacity to create X*Y*Z structures overall even with only X, Y, and Z components each.

The HSR Program focused on developing material-related technologies to enable a High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT) capable of operating temperatures ranging from 54°C (-65°F) to 177°C (350°F). A high-temperature polymeric resin, PETI-5 was used in the HSR Program to satisfy the requirements for performance and durability for a PMC. For RLVs, it was anticipated that this high temperature material would contribute to reducing the overall weight of a vehicle by eliminating or reducing the thermal protection required to protect the internal structural elements of the vehicle and increasing the structural strain limits. The tests were performed to determine temperature-dependent mechanical and physical properties of IM7/PETI-5 composite over a temperature range from cryogenic temperature -253°C (- 423 °F) to the material's maximum use temperature of 230°C (450°F).

The interactivity of analysis of build-up structures can only be achieved by re-using results of component analyses, therefore, the applicability of data based analysis to the O-O approach is investigated in this paper. An object in the O-O approach is a neurocomputing model of a structural component developed for a given set of parameterized design variables, loading, and `smart' connectors. Such connectors define how the given component is connected to the assembly, and what is the validity of such a connection. Since component models can be subject to affine transformations, a family of similar structural components is available for modeling. Neurocomputing models are used to enable data based analysis, because they can relate any design variables and load conditions to the selected system response. The applicability of feed-forward and feature-sensitive neural nets is examined in this context. Object-oriented modeling is illustrated with a design of an assembly of beams using a single-point (SP) connector and an assembly of plates subject to a thermal load using a multi-point (MP) connector.",,"Computer software reusability; Data structures; Database systems; Neural networks; Object oriented programming; Software prototyping; Neurocomputing models; Virtual prototyping; Interactive computer systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342409509

Adams Dr., Columbus, OH 43221, United States","Microwave welding of polymers is performed by placing an electromagnetic absorbent material (polyaniline) at the interface. The absorbent polyaniline converts electromagnetic energy into heat which is conducted into the bulk materials forming molten layers. Pressure, which is applied after the heating stage squeezes the molten layers to form the welded joint. However, if sufficient conductive polymer is retained at the interface, then the welded samples can be placed in the microwave, reheated, and disassembly for recycling and reuse purposes can be performed. Controlling the amount of remaining conductive polymer at the joint interface is the key for achieving disassembly of a microwave welded joint. For this purpose the total displacement was used to characterize both the welding and the disassembly processes. The effect of displacement on joint strength was analyzed. It was found that if the total displacement exceeded 2.7 mm, regardless of the polyaniline concentration (30, 40, 50, 60%) and welding parameters employed, a joint strength of at least 90% the bulk strength is obtained. Disassembly of butt welded joints was then performed. It was found that a joint with a tensile strength of approximately 60% of the bulk strength can be disassembled with a relatively low force of 27 N. However, a long reheating time of 120 seconds and a high power level of 2000 W is required for disassembly to occur. In order to increase the disassembly capability a tuned single-mode microwave system was used. Thus, while the reheating time and power level decreased to 30 seconds, and 1000 W respectively, the maximum joint strength which can be disassembled increased to 80% of the bulk strength. The maximum displacement which can be disassembled was found to be 1 mm regardless of the concentration of PANI used. After disassembly the 60% PANI samples were welded once more with the same parameters as the original welds. The rewelded samples exhibited a maximum loss of 15% in tensile strength.","Conductive polymers; Disassembly; Microwave welding; Recycling","Conductive plastics; Joints (structural components); Microwave heating; Recycling; Strength of materials; Welding; Welds; Disassembly; Displacement; Joint strength; Polyaniline; High density polyethylenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032654424

The cryogenic tanks, due to their large size, are the main structural components of the launcher and a prime objective for mass reduction and design optimization. The structural work on several launcher concepts provided the data to derive a set of requirements for the cryogenic tanks in terms of dimensions, loads, pressures and general configuration; these requirements and objectives were used as input for the development and validation of the technologies necessary to develop large cryogenic tanks. In particular two tanks were designed by separate companies, starting from the same requirements, one in Composite material and the second one in Aluminium-Lithium (AI-Li), with the scope to derive a representative sample to be subject to a series of thermo-mechanical tests. The investigation included the development of basic processes linked to the chosen materials and to the reference configuration; in particular for the AI-Li based design the activity comprised the VPPA welding, the adhesive bonding and the chemical milling; the preliminary validation of the processes performances was achieved with testing at cryogenic temperature of -253°C (-423°F).

The absorbent polyaniline converts electromagnetic energy into heat which is conducted into the bulk materials forming molten layers. Pressure, which applied after the heating stage squeezes the molten layers to form the welded joint. However, if sufficient conductive polymer is retained at the interface, then the welded samples can be placed in the microwave, reheated, and disassembly for recycling and reuse purposes can be performed. Controlling the amount of remaining conductive polymer at the joint interface is the key for achieving disassembly of a microwave welded joint. For this purpose the total displacement was used to characterize both the welding and the disassembly processes. The effect of displacement on joint strength was analyzed. It was found that if the total displacement exceeded 2.7 mm, regardless of the polyaniline concentration (30, 40, 50, 60%) and welding parameters employed, a joint strength of at least 90% the bulk strength is obtained. Disassembly of butt welded joints was then performed. It was found that a joint with a tensile strength of approximately 60% of the bulk strength can be disassembled with a relatively low force of 27 N. However, a long reheating time of 120 seconds and a high power level of 2000 W is required for disassembly to occur. In order to increase the disassembly capability a tuned single-mode microwave system was used. Thus, while the reheating time and power level decreased to 30 seconds, respectively 1000 W, the maximum joint strength which can be disassembled increased to 80% of the bulk strength. The maximum displacement which can be disassembled was found to be 1 mm regardless of the concentration of PANI used. After disassembly the 60% PANI samples were welded once more with the same parameters as the original welds. Tho rewelded samples exhibited a maximum loss of 15% in tensile strength.",,"Butt welding; Conductive plastics; Electric welding; Interfaces (materials); Joints (structural components); Microwave heating; Tensile strength; Microwave welding; Polyanilines; High density polyethylenes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030718937

MARGE creates an application-specific instruction set and generates the custom hardware components required to perform exactly those computations specified by the C program. In contrast to traditional fixed-instruction processors, MARGE's dynamic instruction set creation provides for efficient use of hardware resources. MARGE processes intermediate code in which each operation is annotated by the bit lengths of the operands. Each basic block (sequence of straight line code) is mapped into a single custom instruction which contains all the operations and logic inherent in the block. A synthesis phase maps the operations comprising the instructions into register transfer level structural components and control logic which have been optimized to exploit functional parallelism and function unit reuse. As a final stage, commercial technology-specific tools are used to generate configuration bit streams for the desired target hardware. Technology- specific pre-placed, pre-routed macro blocks are utilized to implement as much of the hardware as possible. MARGE currently supports the Xilinx-based Splash-2 reconfigurable accelerator and National Semiconductor's CLAy-based parallel accelerator, MAPA.

A novel β-(1-3)-glucanosyltransferase was purified to apparent homogeneity from an autolysate of the cell wall of Aspergillus fumigatus. The enzyme had a molecular mass of 49 kDa and contained approximately 5 kDa of N-linked carbohydrate. The enzyme catalyzed an initial endo-type splitting of a β- (1-3)-glucan molecule, followed by linkage of the newly generated reducing end to the nonreducing end of another β-(1-3)-glucan molecule. Laminarioligosaccharides of size G10 and greater were donor substrates for the transferase. Laminarioligosaccharides of size G5 and greater formed acceptors. The enzyme was able to reuse initial transferase products as donors and acceptors in extended incubations, resulting in the formation of increasingly larger transferase products until they became insoluble. The major initial products from an incubation of the transferase with borohydride-reduced G11 (rG11) were rG6 and rG16. 1H NMR analysis of the rG16 transferase product showed it was a laminarioligosaccharide, indicating that the enzyme forms a β-(1-3)-linkage during transfer.

A key part of this program is the X-33 advanced technology demonstrator. The X-33 is an experimental Single Stage to Orbit (SSTO) rocket proof-of-concept demonstrator. The X-33 system must prove the concept of a next-generation system by demonstrating key technology, operations, and reliability requirements in an integrated flight vehicle. The X-33 will fly in 1999.Critical characteristics of SSTO systems, such as the structural/thermal concept, aircraft-like operations and maintenance concepts, flight dynamics, flight loads, ascent and entry environments, mass fraction, fabrication methods, etc., will be incorporated into the X-33 system. The X- 33 will be an automated, suborbital, experimental, single-stage rocket flight vehicle capable of Mach 15 flight. Three basic classes of X-33 / RLV have been investigated: vertical takeoff, horizontal landing (VTHL) wing-body, vertical takeoff, horizontal landing (VTHL) lifting-body, and vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) concepts. The Lockheed Martin Skunkworks was chosen in July of 1996 to build and fly the X-33. Full reusability presents several unique structural challenges. While the RLV system must be lightweight enough to achieve orbit with payload, it must also be robust enough to be operated in a costeffective manner. The system is further complicated by the fact that conventional ascent-only systems (i.e., cryogenic propellant tanks) must now withstand reentry environments. Thus, an integrated structural / system must be developed and demonstrated. Use of graphite-composites for major structural components appears to be the most feasible near-term solution. The X-33 will draw upon extensive advanced military and commercial aircraft experience to demonstrate composite material systems in RLV environments. A combination of both ground and flight testing will subject these systems to the natural and induced (acoustics, ascent and reentry aerodynamic loads, etc.) environments of multiple launch and reentry. © 1996 by American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics,Inc.

It should be used as a ""rule of thumb"" to aid in the initial layout phase for designing electroformed parts. Production cost saving design features for various optical and structural components will be discussed; e.g., mirrors and coldshields. Electroforming is the process of depositing metal ions of a given metal or metal alloy onto an electrically conductive mandrel; typically 6061-T6 aluminum alloy for disposable mandrels and stainless steel for reusable mandrels. In the plating process, metal ions are deposited at the cathode (i.e., on the mandrel); the thickness of the deposit is determined by the length of time and current. Once the deposit is at the desired thickness, the mandrel is removed from the plating bath. The electroform is then separated from the mandrel (for a reusable mandrel) or the mandrel is dissolved in a sodium hydroxide solution (for an aluminum mandrel). In either case, the result is a free-standing electroform that is an exact replica of the mandrel. Many components may be manufactured by electroforming, including metal optics such as searchlight mirrors, and precision structural components like coldshields. All are manufactured by a similar process but key differences require tailored manufacturing planning. This paper will discuss these design and manufacturing differences. For example, high quantity, low cost, production parts can utilize reusable steel mandrels if the component design meets certain shape requirements. The application and optical performance of interior and exterior coatings for electroformed components will be discussed. Photographs, graphs, and charts will be utilized throughout the paper to illustrate component design features, material properties, and optical performance. © 1993 SPIE.

The dominant structural elements are internal tanks for both cryogenic and noncryogenic propellants. These tanks must operate in a broad range of loading and thermal environments while meeting requirements for low weight and reusability. Several approaches to integral tank design are discussed and an analysis of a hot structure honeycomb sandwich tank for a circular body vehicle is presented. © American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 1985, All rights reserved.",,"SANDWICH STRUCTURES - Structural Analysis; STRUCTURAL DESIGN; ADVANCED SPACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS; POST-SHUTTLE ERA TRANSPORTS; SPACECRAFT",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022097581

Both pulse-labeling and pulse-chase-labeling experiments indicate that synthesis of cuticle components occurs at high levels during the molting periods and at much reduced rates during the intermolt periods. No such discontinuous pattern is observed for the synthesis of total noncuticle macromolecules during development. The soluble and insoluble proteins of the cuticle, which comprise the inner and outer cuticle layers, respectively, follow similar patterns of synthesis during the two molts examined. At each molt the structural components of the cuticle account for approximately 10% of the total macromolecules labeled by NaH14CO3. No evidence is found for reuse of cuticle material between successive developmental stages of C. elegans. © 1981.",,"bicarbonate; Caenorhabditis elegans protein; carbon; diagnostic agent; animal; article; biosynthesis; Caenorhabditis elegans; growth, development and aging; larva; metabolism; prenatal development; Animals; Caenorhabditis elegans; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Carbon Radioisotopes; Larva; Sodium Bicarbonate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001537632

Included are a description of the space shuttle system, its characteristics and requirements, selected approaches for fracture control, and proposed fracture control plans. The requirements of the NASA planned space shuttle vehicle for full reusability has increased the need for high reliability, precision, and development in the fracture control approach. For the space shuttle booster, it is essential that fracture control be applied to all critical structural components (i.e., tanks, aero, surfaces, thrust structure, etc.) and the fracture control approach to each component be based on its individual design conditions, design characteristics, and sensitivities to fatigue and flaw growth. Since the fracture control approach of pressure vessels is of most interest, the plan will concentrate on the main propellant tanks although other parts of the vehicle will be mentioned. The selected fracture control plan integrates the fracture control activities over the design, manufacturing, qualification, and operation phases of the space shuttle program. The various elements of the fracture control plan include design criteria, fracture mechanics analysis, proof testing, trade studies of safe-life and fail-safe design approaches and materials, provisions for maintenance and inspection, non-destructive evaluation, and a record of vehicle usage and discrepancies during its service life. © 1972.",,"PRESSURE VESSELS - Failure; ROCKET ENGINES - Boosters; SPACE SHUTTLES",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0015489515
