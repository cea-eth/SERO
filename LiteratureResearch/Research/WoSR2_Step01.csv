Jackson; Friedrich Ratzel; Carl Sauer,ORIGIN; PLACE; HOUSE; LEBENSRAUM; TIME; RACE,"What do housesdoto the people who live with them? In what sense are houses themselves living things? If they live and act, how to conceive of the relationship between built and natural landscapes, and between environment and life more broadly? This article considers three moments at which human geographers have attempted to answer these questions without submitting to visions of environmental causation and constraint favoured by determinists, who dominated the discipline into the early 20th century. The article begins with the work of Carl Sauer, by 1925 the major American figure refuting environmental determinism at a theoretical level and recommending the study of housing as an articulate transcript of human action. It then looks back to the American writings of Friedrich Ratzel, one of several German scholars Sauer canonized, to illuminate a more vitalistic ontology of domestic architecture, and an urbanism, untapped by Sauer when filing his dissent. It then looks ahead to mid-century studies of vernacular architecture - by those of Sauer's students friendlier to urban life than he was, and by the critic and publisher J. B. Jackson - to assess how this inheritance informed critiques of industrial modernity in the post-war United States. The article observes certain continuities, despite manifest tensions, between 'old' and 'new' cultural geographies. It also routes a long-standing set of debates concerning the relationship of materiality to meaning - and of spatial to social form - through the case of human geography, a peculiar interstice in the broader constellation of disciplines.",JUL,2021.0,10.1177/0952695120936097,0.0

However, there is uncertainty about which urban heat mitigation strategies (UHMSs) can provide better solutions for a specific urban context. There is a compelling need for local governments to automate the decision-making process and optimise the combination of UHMSs to maximise the mitigation outcomes for their cities. We develop a novel decision-making framework that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) techniques into urban heat mitigation in the built environment to enable an automated process of decision making. The novel decision-making framework comprises: the ontology-based knowledge representation of UHMSs and their relationships with urban contexts and performance assessment to share knowledge in urban heat mitigation domain; sensitivity analysis of the environmental, social and economic performance of UHMSs to get key variables for UHMSs; and genetic algorithm-based multi-objective optimisation of UHMSs. The novel decision-making framework enables generating the context-based optimised UHMS combinations to support local governments' decision-making. The research outcomes will advance interdisciplinary knowledge about using AI techniques in the decision-making process for urban heat mitigation.",SEP,2022.0,10.1016/j.resconrec.2022.106420,0.0

Building Information Modelling (BIM) is certainly currently a promising technology/method that can achieve this. The output of the construction industry has a considerable scale; however, the concentration of the industry and the level of informatization are still not high. There is still a large gap in terms of productivity between the construction industry and other industries. Due to the lack of first-hand data regarding how much of an effect can be genuinely had by BIM in real cases, it is unrealistic for construction stakeholders to take the risk of widely adopting BIM. This paper focuses on the methodological quantification (through a case study approach) of BIM's benefits in building construction resource management and real-time costs control, in contrast to traditional non-BIM technologies. Through the use of BIM technology for the dynamic querying and statistical analysis of construction schedules, engineering, resources and costs, the three implementations considered demonstrate how BIM can facilitate the comprehensive grasp of a project's implementation and progress, identify and solve the contradictions and conflicts between construction resources and costs controls, reduce project over-spends and protect the supply of resources.",AUG 22,2014.0,10.5772/58448,0.0

However, in the application process of forward design, there is a lack of standardized implementation guidance and mature technical support, leading to many problems such as a redundancy of model information, heterogeneity of data information, and low efficiency of transmission. Based on this, this paper proposes a model view delivery method of forward design for prefabricated buildings. Firstly, a simplified assembly model and an assembly knowledge model are designed and extended with IFC (Industry Foundation Classes), then we realize the knowledge visualization expression by combining with an ontology semantic system. For the model view of a prefabricated building domain, this paper realizes the reusable concept module by ontology IDM (Information Delivery Manual) and properties selection of knowledge graphs, and then completes the model view delivery through data mapping and IfcDoc (Ifc Documentation Generator) tool output.

Nevertheless, there has been a gap between academia and industry in realizing the capabilities of simulation to support decision-making in construction. One of the well-recognized reasons is the difficulty of undertaking comprehensive simulation studies by construction practitioners, who usually lack sufficient knowledge and skills to adequately build simulation models. Efforts to bridge this gap have been focused on simplifying the computer coding and model implementation stages of construction simulation studies with limited research on the early stage of defining the model and abstracting the system, i.e., conceptual modeling. The conceptual modeling stage is known to be one of the most difficult tasks in a simulation study. Thus, several frameworks to support building conceptual models have been proposed in simulation literature. This study contributes to the research efforts to promote simulation in the construction industry through the adoption of a conceptual modeling framework. It demonstrates the application of the proposed conceptual modeling framework in a case study of piling operations. The findings of this paper reinforced the significance of conceptual modeling by confirming the role of the conceptual model as a communication link between stakeholders. Moreover, the conceptual model was used as a specification document for developing a flexible model that can be replicated in other settings. The use of a documented conceptual model assisted in managing the overall simulation study efficiently, which, in turn, lead to reductions in time and effort for different modeling activities.",MAY,2022.0,10.1177/00375497211056087,0.0

However, within the context of information system practice in BIM, knowledge of cost estimation has not been represented, nor has it been integrated into the processes based on BIM. This paper intends to establish an innovative means of taking data from the BIM linked to a project, and using it to create the necessary items for a bill of quantity that will enable cost estimation to be undertaken for the project. Our framework is founded upon the belief that three components are necessary to gain a full awareness of the domain which is being computerised; the information type which is to be assessed for compatibility (syntax), the definition for the pricing domain (semantics), and the precise implementation environment for the standards being taken into account (pragmatics). In order to achieve this, a prototype is created that allows a cost item for the bill of quantity to be spontaneously generated, by means of the semantic web ontology and a forward chain algorithm. Within this paper, 'cost items' signify the elements included in a bill of quantity, including details of their description, quantity and price. As a means of authenticating the process being developed, the authors of this work effectively implemented it in the production of cost items. In addition, the items created were contrasted with those produced by specialists. For this reason, this innovative framework introduces the possibility of a new means of applying semantic web ontology and forward chain algorithm to construction professional practice resulting in automatic cost estimation. These key outcomes demonstrate that, decoupling the professional practice into three key components of syntax, semantics and pragmatics can provide tangible benefits to domain user.

It is one of the primary causes of project schedule and cost overruns. Many studies on defect causation analysis and management system have been conducted to facilitate defect measures and rectifications as well as to reduce the reoccurrence of the defect. However, those studies did not sufficiently consider the relationship of defect information flow in the construction process, which resulted in reactive rather than proactive defect management plan. This paper investigates the issues and needs of current defect management practices in the construction industry. It also presents a conceptual system framework for construction defect management that integrates ontology and augmented reality (AR) with building information modeling (BIM). The following three main technical solutions are proposed in the system framework: 1) defect data collection template to assure data quality and accuracy; 2) defect domain ontology to search and retrieve project or work-specific defect information; and 3) AR-based Defect Inspection System to support field defect management. It is envisaged that the system framework and solutions could enable proactive reduction of the defect occurrence during the construction process and that could greatly improve current defect management practices in the construction industry.

This paper aims to develop a new information management method to cope with the risk problems involved in dealing with such data, based on domain ontologies of the construction industry, to help manage PPP risks, share and reuse risk knowledge. Design/methodology/approach Risk knowledge concepts are acquired and summarized through PPP failure cases and an extensive literature review to establish a domain framework for risk knowledge using ontology technology to help manage PPP risks. Findings The results indicate that the risk ontology is capable of capturing key concepts and relationships involved in managing PPP risks and can be used to facilitate knowledge reuse and storage beneficial to risk management. Research limitations/implications The classes in the risk knowledge ontology model constructed in this research do not yet cover all the information in PPP project risks and need to be further extended. Moreover, only the framework and basic methods needed are developed, while the construction of a working ontology model and the relationship between implicit and explicit knowledge is a complicated process that requires repeated modifications and evaluations before it can be implemented. Practical implications The ontology provides a basis for turning PPP risk information into risk knowledge to allow the effective sharing and communication of project risks between different project stakeholders. It can also have the potential to help reduce the dependence on subjectivity by mining, using and storing tacit knowledge in the risk management process. Originality/value The apparent suitability of the nine classes of PPP risk knowledge (project model, risk type, risk occurrence stage, risk source, risk consequence, risk likelihood, risk carrier, risk management measures and risk case) is identified, and the proposed construction method and steps for a complete domain ontology for PPP risk management are unique. A combination of criteria- and task-based evaluations is also developed for assessing the PPP risk ontology for the first time.",,,10.1108/CI-02-2022-0029,0.0

On the basis of identifying intra-relationships between causations, intra-relationships between accidents, and inter-relationships between causations and accidents, this research aims to develop a subway construction safety risk network (SCSRN) with two layers of 56 causations and 44 accidents. Topological features were identified to denote the roles of individual nodes of causation or accident in the total network of SCSRN. Robustness assessment was conducted in the consideration of three strategies of node failure, namely, random attack, deliberate attack according to the decreasing order of node's total degree, and deliberate attack according to the decreasing order of node's betweenness centrality. The results indicated that the second strategy was more efficient in reducing the connectivity of SCSRN. It was suggested that managers should not pay equal attention to causations and accidents with unequal roles in the SCSRN. This research was beneficial to capturing complex cause-and-effect relationships of accident occurrence at subway construction sites. It can provide the opportunities for optimizing safety-related decisions on the elimination of causations and controlling accidents with high efficiency on site.",JUL,2021.0,10.1016/j.ssci.2021.105261,0.0

The argument for such a semantic rule checking process has been made a number of times by now. However, there are a number of strategies and approaches that can be followed regarding the realization of such a rule checking process, even when limiting to the use of semantic web technologies. In this article, we compare three reference rule checking approaches that have been reported earlier for semantic rule checking in the domain of architecture, engineering and construction (AEC). Each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages. A criterion that is tremendously important to allow adoption and uptake of such semantic rule checking approaches, is performance. Hence, this article provides an overview of our collaborative test results in order to obtain a performance benchmark for these approaches. In addition to the benchmark, a documentation of the actual rule checking approaches is discussed. Furthermore, we give an indication of the main features and decisions that impact performance for each of these three approaches, so that system developers in the construction industry can make an informed choice when deciding for one of the documented rule checking approaches.

With this regard, this paper proposes the Social Network System for Sharing Construction Safety & Health Knowledge (SNSS), which utilizes state-of-the-art of semantic wild web and ontology construction technologies for better communication and representation for construction safety information. The SNSS is developed on the basis of safety semantic wiki template (SSWT), which consists of the following three modules: 1) A Safety information module (SIM) which upload common accident and hazard information for sharing; 2) A Safety knowledge module (SKM) where the safety information is refined, confirmed and transferred to safety knowledge; 3) A Safety dissemination module (SDM) which allows its users to monitor, manage and retrieve safety information and knowledge easily. The SNSS is tested by a scenario of using falling accident information by which the potentials and limitations of the system were addressed.

Typically, construction robots are usually pre-programmed for a single task, such as painting. Their behavior is fixed when they leave the factory. However, it is difficult to pre-program all capabilities (referred to as workplace skills) that construction workers may require. Construction robots are expected to have the same ability of skill learning as human apprentices, allowing them to acquire a wide range of workplace skills from experienced workers and eventually complete relevant construction tasks autonomously. However, workplace skill learning of robots has rarely been investigated in the construction industry. This survey reviews state-of-the-art approaches to help robots learn skills from human demonstrations. To begin, the workplace skill is represented as 'Know That' and 'Know How' problems. 'Know That' is a high-level task planning ability aimed at understanding human activities from demonstrations. 'Know How' refers to the ability to learn specific actions for completing the construction task. Sematic methods and learn from demonstration (LfD) methods are reviewed to tackle these two problems. Finally, we discuss the open issues of past research, present future directions, and highlight the survey's knowledge contributions. We believe that this survey will provide a new perspective on robots in the construction industry and inspire more discussions about skill learning of construction robots.",NOV 1,2022.0,10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117658,0.0

In the case of healthcare facilities, where the policy environment is characterized by change on several fronts, fixed requirements could constrain their evolvability and sustainability. Future-proofing is a response to uncertainty whereby a physical structure is designed to respond to future changes in requirements, change of use, strategic perspectives, business drivers, new policies and changing climate. The paper investigates the causal powers that explain how and why future-proofing decisions achieve a sustainable outcome. A critical realist lens is adopted to develop a configurational perspective of future-proofing design evolution. Critical Realism's open systems ontology of social reality can account for the fact that outcomes are not predictable and can better explain the nature of causation in complex social interactions such as construction projects. A case study research design was conducted comprising in-depth interviews with healthcare construction professionals in a UK setting. The study contributes to the sustainability literature by offering four generative mechanisms of future-proofing decision making and how they contingently lead - or fail to lead - to future-proof outcomes. Two change mechanisms and two problem mechanisms are presented, together with their configuration under the right conditions and context to lead to design decisions for construction projects capable of adapting to a range of possible futures.",,2019.0,10.1088/1755-1315/297/1/012039,0.0

The article shows how consequent processualism is able to implode time-honored, reifying conceptual dichotomies, such as micro-macro, event-structure, agency-social structure, to open new vistas on the social. Building on consequent processualism, the essay argues on the one hand for the significance of theory for the practice of ethnography in identifying and delimiting fruitful field sites.

As matter of fact, few methods exist that can help designers in such task, despite its importance in the definition of the building quality; norms and regulations, personal designer's experience, post-occupancy evaluation have shown their limit to provide predictive models of the complex phenomenon of human behaviour in built environments. With the increasing of computing power, virtual simulation techniques have been introduced in building design to control, manage and predict complex systems of building performances such as its energy or structural behaviour, but not to representation of buildings while-in-use. The Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) paradigm has been applied in building design to simulation of specific aspects of human behaviour and in specific occurrences (for instance in fire egress simulations), while a more extensive representation of users actions, behaviours, and activities is still missing. In order to overcome this lack, in this paper we propose to support agent-based simulation with a knowledge base, developed by means of ontologies and able to provide a structured system of data about human-building interaction, useful as start hypotheses for Agent-based Simulation. For its development, we rely on the general template of building knowledge management already proposed by the research group (Carrara et al., 2009), extending it to representation of the whole system users-built environment. The proposed general template, configuredby the meaning -properties - rules structure, allows the formalization of users/agents entities, whose parameter, attributes and behavioural rules can encode several `aspects' of real users and their interactions with the other entities (building components, furniture, other people) in a built environment. Currently, a first application has been developed dealing with the virtually testing of a small hospital ward, in order to evaluate the reliability and the potentiality of such approach.",,2012.0,,

However, because accident cases are recorded as unstructured text data, significant time and effort are required to retrieve and analyze the knowledge a user wants. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes a knowledge management system for construction accident cases using natural language processing. For this purpose, two models were developed that can retrieve appropriate cases according to user intentions and automatically analyze tacit knowledge from construction accident cases. In the retrieval model, the query is expanded using a construction accident case thesaurus. Ranking is calculated using Okapi BM25 and weighting according to the thesaurus. In the analysis model, knowledge is automatically extracted using rule-based and conditional random field (CRF) methods. The proposed system can retrieve results that are 97% relevant to the accident cases the user intended and can automatically analyze knowledge with accuracies of 93.75% and 84.13% for the rule-based and CRF models, respectively.

As societies and their cultures change, the built environment, the outcome of the collectively produced decisions of a society, is adapted. With modernization, cities became spaces of re-production. This situation has led to the disorientation of society and the transformation of traditional settlements. The imposition of standardized spatial implementations of the modernist rationale has commonly generated transformation of the authentic character and patterns of the traditional settlements vanishingly in time by destroying the existing natural and cultural values. In this respect, the conservation of the existing patterns of traditional settlements, composed of their socio-economic and cultural structures, by highlighting their meaningful role in history, has become a significant issue in the discipline of urban planning. In Turkey, traditional settlement patterns have been subjected to the effects of a divergence in life styles, settlement practices and building processes as a result of economic and technological developments of modernization that have occurred since the mid-20th century. In time, the socio-spatial and cultural characters of traditional settlement patterns, as well as their visual characters, have begun to disappear. The aim of this article is, initially, to explain the concepts of authentic character and cultural heritage by approaching the interaction between culture and the physical environment from an ontological perspective. Later, the article puts forth the inconveniences of the beings of traditional settlement patterns, generated by socio-spatial breakdowns that stem from a disregard for ontological assumptions due to modernization, in conjunction with changing dynamics of everyday urban life in Turkey.

Governments and lawmakers have come up with various regulations that govern the construction industry, such as the Saudi Building Code. These regulations have been effective in creating legal boundaries and rules for contractors and developers to abide by. However, critics and environmentalists suggest that contractors still have undertaken various activities that are of great harm to the environment. For example, wasted materials left in the surrounding area of construction job sites are a great cause of environmental pollution. Such pressure has led to the pursuit of a new trend in the construction industry known as sustainable construction. Sustainable construction entails the use of processes and materials that have little or no negative impact on the environment, and the construction of tall and complex structures that are important to accommodate the ever-growing population. In spite of the universal agreed guidelines for sustainable construction, detailed implementation methods depend on local contexts. This paper presents an initial effort in creating an ontology that describes the potential sustainable construction strategies in Saudi Arabia, to create a guidance for improving the energy efficiency of buildings in Saudi Arabia.

Several alignment variants are usually created and each one is intensely scrutinized. Variants often have individual advantages and disadvantages and can lead to different constructive designs of a tunnel. In order to find the best alignment possible the variants have to be analyzed and evaluated based on requirements and evaluation criteria, such as safety, cost, built environment and operational requirements. To perform this evaluation and to enable comprehensive decision making, a holistic planning environment is examined that includes documents and models of different domains. In general, these domain specific data differ schematically and semantically, which consequently makes it challenging to combine and compare such diverse data. For this purpose, information from different sources must be linked and evaluated in a structured way. In particular, spatial relationships have to be investigated. Therefore, in this paper, ontology databases are utilized to merge BIM and GIS at data level to create an integrated model of the entire tunneling project. Relevant information for decision-making can then be derived, such as the location of private and public buildings that are in a certain vicinity of the planned alignment. On the one hand, the implementation of queries is a popular and frequently used approach to check for semantic properties. On the other hand, using a query language to derive information from geometric data can be challenging, due to the necessity of processing geometric data prior to and during query execution. Additionally, geometric definitions can differ in the considered coordinate reference system, the dimension or the structure. To handle geometry information by employing query languages, representations are methodically transformed to well-known text literals. A simplified and uniform geometric representation can be utilized for spatial reasoning, for example by adopting GeoSPARQL methods.",OCT,2022.0,10.1016/j.aei.2022.101728,0.0

The three objectives of this paper are to: define eco assets explicitly to reach a common understanding of the terms; evaluate the ontology; and discuss a potential area of application. Design/methodology/approach - A seven-step methodology was used to develop the proposed ontology: define the scope; develop the eco asset meta model (EA_MM), define taxonomy, code ontology, capture ontology, evaluate ontology and document ontology. Findings - The EA_MM was developed to represent eco asset domain knowledge, which was further extended to develop the EA_Onto, explicitly defining the eco asset knowledge in asset management. As a part of evaluation, it was found that the knowledge representation is consistent, concise, clear, complete and correct. Practical implications - Theoretically, the proposed ontology is a significant contribution to the body of knowledge in asset management. Practically, the knowledge representation provides a common understanding of eco assets for asset management experts. In addition, it will be used in applications for effective eco asset management. Originality/value - The current literature lacks explicit declaration of eco assets, how they are related to built environment for effective integration and how asset management functions are to be applied to accomplish effective eco asset management. Presently, eco assets are managed on an ad hoc basis, which need to be explicitly defined through developing an EA_Onto for implementation in applications for effective eco asset management.",,2017.0,10.1108/BEPAM-11-2016-0061,0.0

Often, however, traditional data collection methods lack information on the spatial distribution of slum-dwellers. Remote sensing based methods could be used for a rapid inventory of the location and physical composition of slums. (Semi-)automatic detection of slums in image data is challenging, owing to the high variability in appearance and definitions across different contexts. This paper develops an ontological framework to conceptualize slums using input from 50 domain-experts covering 16 different countries. This generic slum ontology (GSO) comprises concepts identified at three levels that refer to the morphology of the built environment: the environs level, the settlement level and the object level. It serves as a comprehensive basis for image-based classification of slums, in particular, using object-oriented image analysis (OOA) techniques. This is demonstrated by with an example of local adaptation of GSO and OOA parameterization for a study area in Kisumu, Kenya. At the object level, building and road characteristics are major components of the ontology. At the settlement level, texture measures can be potentially used to represent the contrast between planned and unplanned settlements. At the environs level, factors which extend beyond the site itself are important indicators, e.g. hazards due to floods plains and marshy conditions. The GSO provides a comprehensive framework that includes all potentially relevant indicators that can be used for image-based slum identification. These characteristics may be different for other study areas, but show the applicability of the developed framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Both deficiencies create problems in fields, such as laboratory medicine, which have to report results of all types of property, preferably in a unified systematic format. The present text aims at forming a domain ontology around property, with intensional definitions and systematic terms, mainly using the terminological tools - with some additions - provided by the International Standards ISO 704,1087-1, and 10241. System and component are defined, quantity is discussed, and the generic concept property is given as 'inherent state- or process-descriptive feature of a system including any pertinent components'. Previously, the term 'kind-of-quantity' and quasisynonyms have been used as primitives; the proposed definition of kind-of-property is 'common defining aspect of mutually comparable properties'. Examination procedure, examination method, examination principle, and examination are defined, avoiding the term 'test'. The need to distinguish between instances of characteristic, property, type of characteristic, kind-of-property ' and property value is emphasized; the latter is defined together with property value scale. These fundamental concepts are presented in a diagram, and the effect of adding essential characteristics to give expanded definitions is exemplified. Substitution usually leads to unwieldy definitions, but reveals circularity as does exhaustive consecutive listing of defining concepts. The top concept <property> may be generically divided according to many terminological dimensions, especially regarding which operators are allowed among the four sets =, not equal; <, >; +, -; and x, :. The coordinate concepts defined are termed by the modifiers, 'nominal', 'ordinal', 'differential', and 'rational' before '...property'. Other possibilities are given, based on the literature, especially the stepwise division into nominal property and quantity; ordinal quantity and unitary quantity; differential unitary quantity and rational unitary quantity. As top concepts, <kind-of-property>, <examination procedure>, <examination>, <property value>, and <property value scale> are i.a. divided homologously to <property>. The term 'observation' and the modifiers 'qualitative', 'semiquantitative', and 'quantitative' are avoided. Metrological unit and system of metrological units are defined together with a number of specific concepts. Some problems with characteristics of SI unit are discussed and an alternative system shown. The conceptions of metrological dimension are outlined, leading to a definition and specific concepts. The generally accepted IUPAC/IFCC syntax for designations of instantiated properties is 'System (specification)--Component(specification); kind-of-property(specification)',anddedicatedkind-of-property is defined as 'kind-of-property with given sort of system and any pertinent sorts of component'. The related systematic terms may be generated according to ENV 1614 using generative patterns from ENV 12264. The elements of the appellation and examination result of a singular rational property are diagrammed. Finally, the possibilities of representing properties and their results by the formalisms of relation and function from Set Theory and Object-Oriented Analysis are exemplified.",,2004.0,,

Design/methodology/approach - Standardized web service technology is used in the proposed framework for data specification, transfer, and integration. Open standard SAWSDL is used to annotate web service descriptions with pointers to concepts defined in ontologies. NoSQL database Cassandra is used for distributed data storage among construction supply chain stakeholders. Findings - Ontology can be used to support heterogeneous data transfer and integration through web services. Distributed data storage facilitates data sharing and enhances data control. Practical implications - This paper presents examples of two ontologies for expressing construction supply chain information-ontology for material and ontology for purchase order. An example scenario is presented to demonstrate the proposed web service framework for material procurement process involving three parties, namely, project manager, contractor, and material supplier. Originality/value - The use of web services is not new to construction supply chains (CSCs). However, it still faces problems in channelizing information along CSCs due to data heterogeneity. Trust issue is also a barrier to information sharing for integrating supply chains in a centralized collaboration system. In this paper, the authors present a web service framework, which facilitates storage and sharing of information on a distributed manner mediated through ontology-based web services. Security is enhanced with access control. A data model for the distributed databases is also presented for data storage and retrieval.",,2015.0,10.1108/ECAM-07-2014-0089,0.0

The two objectives are: first, to describe how different ontologies developed as part of this research support the design of message templates (MTs) that were implemented in the AIIS; and second, to explain the development and application of the prototype system for tangible capital asset (TCA) reporting. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed system was developed in the MS SharePoint platform using a four-step methodology: create a web site and library; review and modify MTs; design and configure workflows; and add functionalities. Findings - First, the architecture, methodology, and evaluation of the two ontologies: Transaction Domain Ontology and Tangible Capital Asset Ontology, developed as part of this research work were briefly introduced to describe how both the ontologies supported the design of MTs that were implemented in the AIIS. Second, the AIIS was successfully developed and applied in the domain of infrastructure management for the Asset Inventory and Condition Assessment Reporting. Practical implications - The development of the AIIS would enable industry experts to exchange the tangible capital information. The built-in search engine and history services would help the experts to search a transaction and track the transaction history. The real-time visualisation of the data would help in decision making. Originality/value - Infrastructure agencies use diversified information systems to manage infrastructure systems. Due to propriety nature of the information systems, the TCA data generated is heterogeneous and inconsistent, which make it difficult to exchange with other organisations. Also, the existing applications focus on processing and managing the TCA data for a variety of tasks; however, lack to support data exchange with other organisations. This emphasises the gap that requires the development of an ontology-supported collaboration system in the domain of infrastructure asset management.",,2015.0,10.1108/BEPAM-02-2014-0012,0.0

Part of this data concerns performance metrics expressed among others in terms of cost, energy consumption or system reliability. Such performance values are the focus of project stakeholders who try to optimize them already in building design phase. These values are computed by simulation software that reuses a subpart of the BIM data as input. This provides a better view of building performances but less on threats and underperformances in the building life cycle. Moreover, despite the existence of different risk analysis methods, these are still quite difficult to integrate into a BIM design process. This research aims at closing this gap by first, integrating risk information as well as related uncertainty sources into the BIM process. Second, a method is developed for simulating uncertainty and computing risk metrics. Finally, the evaluation of risk levels is supported by the use of semantic web technologies through a risk ontology. (c) 2017 The Authors.

The effective management of knowledge is vital to the survival and prosperity of a company, particularly in project-based industries such as construction. As a result, construction companies have adopted Information Technology (IT)-based KM systems (KMSs). KMS refers to the technology platform and infrastructure that an organization employs to support KM. However, the increasing attention given to KM is targeted at Large Multi-national Construction companies (LMCs), with little attention given to Small and Medium-sized Construction companies (SMCs). Compared to LMCs, SMCs need different sources and types of knowledge and technology to remain nourished and healthy. In this context, this research attempts to facilitate KM activities within SMCs through the distribution of a set of KM technologies tailored to meet the requirements of SMCs. First, we analyze key obstacles to implement KM activities within SMCs through a survey. Based on this analysis, a set of KM technologies are then identified and adapted to support the KM activities of SMCs in a feasible fashion. In addition, we discuss the expected change of organizational behavior by the distribution of those KM technologies. In the end, these technologies are synthesized into a web-based Construction Knowledge Management Portal (CKMP) system that seeks the inter-organizational sharing of construction knowledge.

The high probability of inaccurate manual building inspections plus the lack of real-time input of dynamic factors urges development of automated BMS. Therefore, Building Information Modelling (BIM) plays a key role towards automation in construction and corresponding management systems.

Such a framework can also improve the successful accomplishment of building projects. This paper aims to use Semantic Web technologies for facilitating information exchange within existing building projects. Design/methodology/approach In real-world building projects, the construction industry's information supply chain may initiate from near scratch when new building projects are started resulting in diverse data structures represented in unstructured data sources, like Excel spreadsheets and documents. Large-scale data generated throughout a building's life-cycle requires exchanging and processing during an asset's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase. Building information modelling (BIM) processes and related technologies can address some of the challenges and limitations of information exchange and interoperability within new building projects. However, the use of BIM in existing and retrofit assets has been hampered by the challenges surrounding the limitations of existing technologies. Findings The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it briefly outlines the framework previously developed for generating semantically enriched 3D retrofit models. Secondly, a framework is proposed focussing on facilitating the information exchange and interoperability for existing buildings. Semantic Web technologies and standards, such as Web Ontology Language and existing AEC domain ontologies are used to enhance and improve the proposed framework. Originality/value The proposed framework is evaluated by implementing an example application and the Resource Description Framework data produced by the previously developed framework.

It is designed to handle non-repetitive processes, where the course of actions has to be decided for each case individually, based on the assessment of the current situation. ACM uses domain-specific data and the analysis of rules to provide the relevant information at the right time to the business users. This supports their actions and decision making but does not dictate predefined workflows that are difficult or even impossible to define for knowledge-intensive work and prevent users from efficiently achieving their goals. Solutions for ACM implementations need to focus on business requirements to support business users rather than limit them by extending existing tools such as content management systems, BPM-based software suites, or collaboration tools with ad hoc development that all lack the ability to adapt flexibly to business level changes without requiring significant IT development efforts. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach by applying business architecture concepts for the definition of ACM applications in combination with domain-specific ontologies and business rules. Business domain analysts describe with the domain-specific ontology the complete value stream with its goals, activities and rules which use a formalized natural business language. The resulting business information model is mapped to an underlying data model and instantly enacted during case execution so that adaptations get immediately available to the business users. The behavioral business rules guide business users to guarantee case compliance which facilitates an easy and rapid adaptation of business applications.

Thus positive and continuous actions need to be taken to preserve the heritage buildings or else a country might lose its cultural heritage value. In managing historic buildings, managers are often faced with complex decision-making process due to limited or unavailability of reliable information. The absence of such information influenced the way decision making and problem-solving made by the managers. This paper aims to highlight the potentials of Building Information Modelling (BIM) as a decision support system for cultural heritage management. An embedded case study was conducted on Istana Balai Besar Kota Bharu, focusing on the changes of the historical building's layout to demonstrate the ontology. A measured drawing dated back in 1976 was used together with the terrestrial laser scanning activity performed presently on the physical building in creating a model in BIM environment. The result gives an overview about tracking information on changes within a historical building as part of cultural heritage management. This paper finds that by modelling the data captured by the 3D laser scanner and utilizing the existing data, BIM is capable of helping managers to retrieve, analyze and store important information in a more efficient and productive process. This exploration is substantial as a precursor to a much broader study on BIM for cultural heritage in the Malaysian context. As BIM is set to drive the construction industry, the finding made would be a catalyst for creating awareness to support the development of BIM for cultural heritage management in Malaysia.

One of the strategies is called hybrid integration, which intends to balance the strength of sharing common semantic models and mapping between heterogeneous data sources. The hybrid integration strategy relies on three major components, i.e., contextual semantics, mapping algorithms and a community-specific conceptual representation. The community-specific conceptual representation is the key for achieving the hybrid integration. In order to make the conceptual representation sharable by project participants.. ontological representations seem ideal. However, existing ontological representation languages, such as OWL, has limitations that are not expressive enough. This paper, thus, developed BNF (Backus-Baur Form) representations of semantic mappings for the hybrid integration strategy, which is independent to specific representation languages.

It enriches the discussion by focusing on one specific subdomain-the application of digital methods in road design, construction and operation which involves the exchange, management and querying of spatio-semantic data that typically stems from different data sources and involves diverse software systems and data models. It argues that semantic web techniques significantly simplify the integration of heterogeneous data models. In a case study, the German road data exchange standard OKSTRA is linked with the Dutch CB-NL and RWS object type libraries. Doing so, it is shown how nationally well-established and widespread standards can be integrated in order to perform cross-country querying of road data.

The creation and testing of such method was conducted in the field of leukemias in the scope of the Blood Ontology project. The results show that definitions of biomedical entities are defined in a variety of criteria, which do not always meet the ontological representation requirements for adequate communication between medical information systems. Some well-known issues already identified are the identification of essential features of an entity, in addition to involve circularity, intangibility as well as the complexity in diagnosing manifold diseases such leukemias.

The drawing of these representations is a time-consuming task, accomplished by manual work by skilled operators who often rely on in-situ analysis and on pictures. In this project three-dimensional an automated method for the condition survey of reinforced concrete spalling has been developed. To realize the automated image-based survey it has been exploited the Mask R-CNN neural network. The training phase has been executed over the original model, providing new examples of images with concrete cover detachments. At the same time, a photogrammetry process involved the images, in order to obtain a point cloud which acts as a reference to a Scan to BIM process. The BIM environment serves as a collector of information, as it owns the ontology to recreate entities and relationships. The information as extracted by neural network and photogrammetry serve to create the pictures which depict the concrete spalling in the BIM environment. A process of projecting information from the images to the BIM recreates the shapes of the pathology on the objects of the model, which becomes a decision support system for the built environment.

The multifaceted causes of this performance gap are resulting from the misalignment between design assumptions and actual construction processes that take place on-site. In general, critical factors are rooted in the lack of interoperability around the building and work-environment information due to its heterogeneous nature. To overcome the interoperability challenge in safety management, this paper represents the development of an ontological model consisting of terms and relationships between these terms, creating a conceptual information model for construction safety management and linking that ontology to IfcOWL. The developed ontology, named Safety and Health Exchange (SHE), comprises eight concepts and their relationships required to identify and manage safety risks in the design and planning stages. The main concepts of the developed ontology are identified based on reviewing accident cases from 165 Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) and 31 Press Releases from the database of the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) in the United Kingdom. Consequently, a semantic mapping between the developed ontology and IfcOWL (the most popular ontology and schema for interoperability in the AEC sector) is proposed. Then several SPARQL queries were developed and implemented to evaluate the semantic consistency of the developed ontology and the cross-mapping. The proposed ontology and cross-mapping gained recognition for its innovation in utilising OpenBIM and won the BuildingSMART professional research award 2020. This work could facilitate developing a knowledge-based system in the BIM environment to assist designers in addressing health and safety issues during the design and planning phases in the construction sector.",,2022.0,10.36680/j.itcon.2022.005,0.0

We do this by focusing on the concept of Circular Economy. Circular Economy is often presented as a solution to the problems of a globalized economy in the form of over-exploitation of resources, climate change and pollution of the environment. Within the mainstream economics paradigm, the aim is how to increase the effectiveness of resource extraction and utilization in order to maintain growth. We contrast this with the paradigm of Ecological Economics where the goal of the economy is to achieve and secure a higher quality of life. Circular Economy often side steps the deep ontological and epistemological questions we need to answer if we are to address the complex and interrelated environmental, economic and social problems we face today. This can be a limiting factor in the search for creative and long-term solutions. However, within the Circular Economy discourse, we find strands that critically engage with the foundations of mainstream Economics and so, innovative solutions for the society of the future are a possibility. We argue that to bring about a lasting solution to the interconnected social, economic and environmental problems, Circular Economy must engage with the ontological, epistemological and axiological foundations of mainstream economics. To further this argument, we apply Imre Lakatos' 'research program' model to philosophy of science as our framework of analysis and draw lessons for business and communities.",MAR,2021.0,10.1007/s40926-019-00112-1,0.0

However, our analysis shows that the prominent idea of hermeneutic circle, with its implicit presuppositions of centricity and totality, can only be a preliminary answer to the problem of the radical concealment. Through a destructive interpretation of the passages on the they and the death in Being and Time, we will show finally that despite the predominance of hermeneutic thinking in the phenomenology of Dasein, its concrete phenomenological analysis has already highlighted certain essential existential phenomena that should have broken the circular movement of Dasein's existence.",JUL,2016.0,,

The potential also extends to the construction phase where the designers can provide more timely responses to problems encountered in the field. Within this environment, there is the need for effective mechanisms for design and construction information management, in addition to an ontology that facilitates the sharing of design and construction information and the underlying semantics.

Research, such as the development of Semantic Exchange Modules, and/or the linking of IFC with semantic web structures, demonstrates the need for building models to better support complex semantic functionality. To implement model semantics effectively, however, it is critical that model designers consider semantic information constructs. This paper discusses semantic models with relation to determining the most suitable information structure. We demonstrate how semantic rigidity can lead to significant long-term problems that can contribute to model failure. A sufficiently detailed feasibility study is advised to maximize the value from the semantic model.

The concept of learning objects is the basis for a new instructional design paradigm for e-learning that puts the emphasis on reuse as a key characteristic of learning activities. In the last decade, several efforts towards the standardisation of learning technology have resulted in the emergence of specific terminologies that are used to name and classify learning elements. Most of these efforts underline the importance of providing metadata information for content in a standardised format as a crucial step to reusability. Most of the current learning object repositories provide room for metadata, but lack a semantic model that clearly establishes what a learning object is and what its associated metadata such as pedagogy should be. The lack of semantics in learning objects also affects their interoperability, sharability and reusability. The Semantic Web-based solution facilitates the easy integration and identification of meaningful interrelationships, represents and uniquely identifies the digital resources and improves search precision. However, Semantic Web has not been fully applied to e-learning, particularly for developing and delivering reusable learning objects.

Existing representations, in the form of classification systems and product data models, lack effective modeling of concept semantics-a fundamental requirement for human-based exchange of knowledge. Toward this objective, this paper presents a domain taxonomy that was developed as part of the e-COGNOS project. The taxonomy was developed as a first step in the establishment of domain ontology for construction. The taxonomy was developed to be process-centered and to allow for utilization of already existing classification systems (BS6100, Master Format, and UniClass, for example). The taxonomy uses seven major domains to classify construction concepts: Process, Product, Project, Actor, Resource, Technical Topics, and Systems. The taxonomy was developed and validated through extensive interaction with domain experts. The taxonomy was used to develop a prototype ontology for the construction domain including semantic relationships and axioms. The ontology was used to support several applications in semantic knowledge management as part of the e-COGNOS portal, including semantic indexing and retrieval of information and ontology-based collaborative project development.",OCT,2005.0,10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2005)19:4(394),0.0

While Althusser self-consciously undertook to defend the scientific character of Marxism and so permanently establish it on a firm footing, many of his closest followers eventually exited the Marxian paradigm for a post-structuralism post-Marxism. We will argue that this development was rooted in Althusser's initial procedure as he attempted to ground Marxism's scientificity in an epistemological argument whose main referent was Marxism itself. This initiated a circularity which was ultimately to prove fatal to Althusser's project. Less remarked upon, however, is a further legacy of the Althusserian oeuvre, the critical realist conception of Marxism initiated by Roy Bhaskar. Bhaskar found part of his inspiration in Althusser's successful posing of the question of Marx's science. On the one hand, Althusser's work can legitimately be seen as a bridge into the post-modern challenge to Marxism. On the other hand, it can be seen as clearing the ground and establishing some of the foundation for critical realism's successful recuperation of the scientific character of Marxism.",,2014.0,10.1108/S0161-723020140000029007,0.0

These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference. Therefore, in this paper we will look into existing efforts in obtaining an ifcOWL ontology from the EXPRESS schemas of IFC and analyse which features would be required in a usable and recommendable ifcOWL ontology. In making this analysis, we present our implementations of an EXPRESS-to-OWL converter and the key features of the resulting ifcOWL ontology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

After 1955, Empson emerged as a leading skeptic of literary high modernism by means of the novel analogy argued in his essay, Donne the Space Man (1957): namely, that literary depictions of space in Donne's early poetry, athwart high Church doctrine, paralleled contemporary skepticism, in Empson's own time, about interpretive orthodoxies within Eliotic criticism and among the American New Critics. With its focus upon what he calls space travel, Empson's exegesis in Donne the Space Man (1957) pioneered what today one may call the scalar turn in literary modernist criticism. In Empson's case, a scalar criticism endorsed Donne's search for a more generous plurality of critical worlds and embraced cosmological scale irreducible to the more dogmatic worldview of Christian-inspired theorizations then prevailing. Re-reading the Donne the Space Man essay today - and when applying approaches inspired by the phenomenology of the contemporary built environment, object-oriented ontology, and unseen lifeworlds - allows for a more meaningful treatment of Empson's criticism in its historical context, and when using scale as an heuristic to broaden our understandings of cosmologies, near and far, vastly different from our own.",JAN 2,2017.0,10.1080/25723618.2017.1339506,0.0

Disability studies and STS have followed somewhat parallel paths in the history of ideas. From a positivist approach to their research objects to a strong social constructivism, both disciplines have moved to postmodern conceptualisations of science, technology and disability. In the same manner, this paper brings the conceptual vocabulary of actor-network theory (ANT) to the field of disability studies. ANT enables the ordering of disability as a simultaneous biological, material and semiotic phenomenon. The focus of the analysis shifts from merely defining disability as an impairment, handicap, or social construction (epistemology) to how disability is experienced and enacted in everyday practices, in policy-making, in the body, and in the built environment (ontology). This adoption of an ontological approach to disability allows the analysis to not only discuss how disability is done, but also to follow how disability groups and carriers of disability expertise and experience intervene in policy-making by developing 'research in the wild' and confronting scientific experts in different fora (ontological politics).",,2011.0,10.1080/09687599.2011.618737,0.0

First, a novel concept expansion algorithm is proposed to solve the problem caused by insufficient terminologies. Second, a reranking algorithm is developed to solve the problem caused by coarse granularity of concepts.

The conversion from EXPRESS to OWL is of particular use to the architectural design and construction industry, because one of the key data models in this domain, namely the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), is represented using the EXPRESS information modelling language. These conversion efforts have by now resulted in a recommended ifcOWL ontology that stays semantically close to the EXPRESS schema. Two major improvements could be made in addition to this ifcOWL basis. First, the ontology could be split into diverse modules, making it easier to use subsets of the entire ontology. Second, geometric aggregated data (e.g. lists of coordinates) could be serialised into alternative, less complex semantic structures. The purpose of both improvements is to make ifcOWL data smaller in size and complexity. In this article, we focus entirely on the second topic, namely the optimization of geometric data in the semantic representation. We outline and discuss the diverse available options in optimizing the data representations used. We quantify the impact of these measures on the ifcOWL ontology and instance model size. We conclude with an explicit recommendation and give an indication of how this recommendation might be implemented in combination with the already available ifcOWL ontology. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the main concepts and benefits of knowledge management, relationships between knowledge management and continuous improvement have been examined. Furthermore, emphasis has been laid on knowledge management through experience feedback processes which constitute valuable assets for the AEC industry. This is done through the employment of ontologies and graph-based reasoning operations in eliciting and visualizing knowledge concepts in the AEC domain. The proposed approach which consists of two main aspects provides the opportunity to examine the conceptual and ontological knowledge models with associated reasoning. In the first, the concepts of knowledge management, their significance and application in the AEC field are discussed. The second deals with a methodological framework for the modeling and reasoning in the domain ontology. To facilitate automation, an ontology graph-based editor, Conceptual Graphs User Interface (CoGui) was used to model knowledge and encoded reasoning in the knowledge base. CoGui encodes knowledge as conceptual graphs and reasoning as graph operations that can be visualized in a logically precise way, based on domain ontologies. It emerged that CoGui could be very useful in acquiring information that can be used in collaboration with others to continuously improve information sharing and re-use.

Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The building and construction domain is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information between actors. For example, semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, are problems fundamentally created through the employment of representations to map the 'world' into models in an endeavour to anticipate different actors' views, vocabulary, and objectives. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work is the process of formalization and representation of document content, where most existing approaches are limited in their capability and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched by incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (the Semantic Associations) modelled by domain ontologies combined with the information presented in documents, thereby providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework for representation of knowledge sources, where each knowledge source is semantically represented (within its domain of use) by a Semantic Vector. This work contributes to the enrichment of Semantic Vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support, employing ontology concepts and their relations in the enrichment process. The test bed for the assessment of the approach is the Building and Construction industry, using an appropriate B&C domain Ontology. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications.

This combinatory approach argues for reflexivity as an epistemic criterion of ontological coherence, which suggests that social ontologies should account for the possibility of self-reflective subjectivity - for otherwise they result in a paradoxical conclusion according to which a social scientist reflects on her or his ontological commitments even though these commitments deny her or him the capacity for self-reflection. This analysis presupposes that all human sciences are categorically premised on social ontologies; and it argues for an analytical distinction between self-reflection, which refers to the agential capacity for reflecting on one's own commitments, and the epistemic criterion of reflexivity hereby proposed. These two analytically distinct though interdependent socio-theoretical concepts are frequently conflated in the literature; thus, this article also aims at a clearing of the ground' that can be of categorical use to the human sciences.",DEC,2017.0,10.1177/0952695117724660,0.0

Knowledge in short is group-centred, and chronocentric in its privileging of the current. This argument is extended to the idea and practice of modernism in the built environment, and contrasted with a postmodernism that reflexively works from an epistemology and ontology of the local.

This involves the formal semantics of these languages which is typically based on a limited set of abstract mathematical notions. In this paper, we discuss the interplay between formal semantics and the intended role of ontologies as semantic foundation. In this connection a circularity is identified if ontologies are to determine the conceptual equivalence of expressions. This is particularly relevant for ontologies which arc to be provided in multiple formalisms. In order to overcome this situation, ontological semantics is generally defined as a novel kind of semantics which is purely and directly based on ontological entities. We sketch a specific application of this semantics to the syntax of first order logic. In order to beneficially rely on theoretical results and reasoning systems, an approximation of the proposed semantics in terms of the conventional approach is established. This results in a formalization method for first order logic and a translation-based variant of ontological semantics. Both variants involve an ontology for their application. In the context of developing a top-level ontology, we outline an ontology which serves as a meta-ontology in applying ontological semantics to the formalization of ontologies. Finally, resolved and remaining issues as well as related approaches are briefly discussed.",,2008.0,10.3233/978-1-58603-923-3-49,0.0

Matching two data models effectively and efficiently is a challenging task, especially when performed manually, due to the large size and the complexity of today's data schemas. Some existing computer-aided approaches have attempted to automate matching of different schemas. These approaches work and reduce human effort under specific conditions; however, they do not always result in an accurate matching of two schemas. Achieving schema matching result comparable in accuracy to manual matching requires leveraging domain specific knowledge. Yet utilization of domain knowledge for schema matching rarely has been incorporated in prior studies. In this paper, we present a semiautomated approach that leverages domain knowledge to improve the schema matching process. Compared to a generic schema matching approach, the approach discussed in this paper is able to generate more accurate results due to the incorporation of domain specific constraints, which are represented and reasoned with to create a match between data models. A prototype was developed to validate this approach through a number of real world test cases, including the matching of two publicly-available data exchange standards.",MAY-JUN,2008.0,10.1061/(ASCE)0887-3801(2008)22:3(170),0.0

This is partly due to policies by various governments requiring existing and new buildings to comply with certain standards or regulations. However, the verification of whether a building complies with any particular standard or regulation has proven challenging in practice. The purpose of formal verification is to prove that under a certain set of assumptions, a building will adhere to a certain set of requirements, for example the minimum performance standards of key environmental issues. Compliance checking requires different criteria often difficult to straightforwardly define and combine in an integrated fashion for providing holistic interpretation to facilitate easy decision-making. Such criteria, their various flows and combinations can easily be dealt with using conceptual graph theories and Semantic Web concepts which allow rules to be imbued to facilitate reasoning. The aim of this study is to tap on conceptual graphs and Semantic Web concepts to develop a system for checking Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM) sustainability standard compliance in the French construction industry. A conceptual graph-based framework that formally describes BREEAM requirements and visually analyse compliance checking processes has been proposed. When implemented in a software that integrates conceptual graphs and Semantic Web knowledge, automatic reasoning allows both the logical specification and the visual interpretation to be displayed and further provides a semantic support for compliance checking information.

Accidents increase costs and construction time. Accordingly, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has relevant safety regulations for the construction industry. Integration of construction safety strategies into the design phase can prevent potential safety hazards. Most accidents occurring in this field are falling from the roof. Therefore, this paper has narrowed the scope of this study to falls from the roof and has developed the knowledge modeling based on the safety rules provided by OSHA. To apply safety rules at the design stage automatically, safety knowledge or information must first be understandable by the computers. In this study, the knowledge system was developed through ontology modeling using the ontology editing program Protege. The developed ontology model has two superclasses. These include information on building components based on the most widely used building information modeling program, and knowledge about roof-related safety rules provided by OSHA. The safety plan must include safety accidents and rules as well as their countermeasures associated with the components at the design stage. This paper is the first step to safety management at the design stage, which is the development of ontology modeling so that software can recognize and understand the construction safety knowledge and information. Beginning with this modeling, if there is a potential risk of violating rules related to construction safety requirements, all relevant safety controls are carried out at the design stage. In other words, the design will be completed, and the safety management plan will be finished before construction starts so that the accidents will be prevented during construction.",,2020.0,,

With the advent of building information modeling, a 3D CAD model of a project is used as a shared knowledge resource during the design, construction, and facility management phases of a project's life cycle. Currently, 4D models are created by combining CAD and schedule information. A 4D model is useful for detecting potential construction conflicts during the project planning and design and a valuable tool during construction. However, creating 4D models requires a great amount of human involvement. An approach that facilitates integrating BIM and schedule information can improve efficiency and is highly desirable.

The Semantic Web approach allows information to be saved once at the provider source and be used by authorized users as needed.

Holistic study of multiple energy-related behaviors is scarce. To fill the gap, this study investigated 22 government office buildings in Sichuan using questionnaires and field measurement. Environmental factors were ranked based on the two dimensions of importance level'level  and satisfaction level . The key energy-related behaviors were identified by the comparative study between low- and high-energy-consuming buildings. Lastly, interactions between the building energy consumption, indoor environment quality, occupants' satisfaction, and human behaviors were analyzed. Questionnaires reveal that most occupants consider indoor air quality as the prior pain point  while feeling satisfied enough with the thermal environment. Although people attach less importance to the acoustic environment, they manifest evident discontent, suggesting that noise control is an urgent imperative. In contrast, occupants are relatively unconcerned with illuminance, which implies the feasibility of saving energy by reasonably reducing lighting requirements of some non-critical areas. The comparative study indicates that increased energy consumption was attributable to extra personal appliances, wasteful air conditioning habits, and the lack of ventilation in summer.

Rather than facilitating collaboration, this form of centralized representation actually showed that the A/E/C (Architecture / Engineering / Construction) industry is so fragmented that the data-centric approach is not feasible, for technical and procedural reasons: the shared database quickly becomes too large and unwieldy to support the dynamic process of multi-disciplinary collaborative design.

For upcoming, new approaches to store building data, such as the Semantic Web, no universal common agreement exists on the combination of geometric and non-geometric data. It can therefore be unclear to users on how to represent their geometries, leading to a decelerated application and advancement of making building data available over the web. This gap can only be bridged if a common approach on the representation of geometries on the web is achieved. To first generate a common understanding of geometry representations, an overview of existing and developing geometry (web) standards needs to be given and discussed, i.e., the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), CityGML, GeoSPARQL, and the OntoBREP and GEOM ontologies. This discussion needs to consider general contexts, e.g., 2D, 3D, detailed, or tessellated geometries, and specific use cases of the construction industry. Based on these discussions, this paper aims to propose a general recommendation for web-based geometry representations to enhance future applications of building data on the web. Due to the variety of use cases and their requirements, as well as technical constraints based on deviant interpretations of geometry descriptions from different geometry kernels, it became clear, that no approach or standard is generally superior to others. The biggest distinction identified in this paper is posed between the context of visualizing, where simplified, tessellated geometry holds the highest advantage, and (parametric) modeling, which requires semantically detailed geometry representations. Hence, we recommend to interlink non-geometric data with multiple geometry representations, to address all relevant contexts and use cases appropriately. The individual geometry representations should be chosen based on the relevant use cases for an optimal experience when using and exchanging geometry on the web.

For monocrystalline photovoltaics, for example, there are recycling processes for glass and aluminum, but these must rather be described as downcycling. The semiconductor material is not recycled at all. Another promising technology for sustainable energy generation is dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Although efficiency and long-term stability still need to be improved, the technology has high potential to complement the state of the art. DSSCs have comparatively low production costs and can be manufactured without toxic components.

State-of-the-art technologies, such as silicon-based photovoltaic or wind power plants, are harnessing renewable energy but causing problems and resource losses at the end of their useful life. This alarming situation must be addressed with renewable energy technologies that can be used longer, repaired and remanufactured, and properly recycled at the end of their useful life. An emerging technology that can complement the established systems is dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Their production is less energy intensive and they can be manufactured without toxic materials. In line with the concept of the circular economy, the service life of all products must be improved in order to reduce resource consumption. Therefore, we investigated the potential for remanufacturing DSSCs by taking apart old DSSCs, cleaning the components, and building new DSSCs from the remanufactured components. The remanufactured DSSCs have the same or higher efficiencies and can be remanufactured multiple times.",MAY,2022.0,10.3390/su14095670,0.0

Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The Building and Construction domain is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information among actors. Semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, for example, are problems fundamentally originated through the employment of representations to map the `world' into models in an endeavour to anticipate other actors' views, vocabulary, and even motivations. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work relates to the process of formalization and representation of document contents, where most existing approaches are limited and only take into account of the explicit, word- based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched through incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (Semantic Associations) modelled by domain ontologies with the addition of information presented in documents, by providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework for representation of knowledge sources, where each knowledge source is semantically represented (within its domain of use) by a Semantic Vector. This work contributes to the enrichment of Semantic Vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support, employing ontology concepts and their relations in the enrichment process. The test bed for the assessment of the approach is the Building and Construction, using an appropriate domain Ontology. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications. Future work and open issues are also discussed.",,2014.0,,

There has been burgeoning research on the technical aspects of ZCBs. However, the aspect of stakeholder engagement, albeit imperative for zero carbon development, has been largely overlooked in the literature. This paper examines stakeholder knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) with regard to ZCBs in a systems manner, employing a new KAP model that integrates ontology, axiology and epistemology as the theoretical lens. The research was carried out through a questionnaire survey and focus group discussions with multiple stakeholders in the building industry in Hong Kong, which is a typical example of a high-density city. The results indicate the generally ambiguous and inconsistent knowledge, relatively negative attitude, and poor practice of stakeholders towards ZCBs. The statistical analysis findings reveal that differentiation exists between different stakeholder groups as to their knowledge, and this highlights the significant role that explicit ZCB knowledge plays in creating a knowledge-induced attitude that favours changes in practice leading to zero carbon developments. The applicability of the developed KAP model is verified using the case of Hong Kong, enabling the dialectics and complexities of stakeholder KAP towards ZCBs to be further clarified. Practical implications are provided to enhance the knowledge, shape the attitudes, and encourage the practices of building towards zero carbon in future cities. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there still exists semantic gaps between design models and regulatory texts, hindering the exploitation of ARC. Thus, a knowledge-informed framework for improved ARC is proposed based on natural language processing. Within the framework, an ontology is first established to represent domain knowledge, including concepts, synonyms, relationships, constraints, etc. Then, semantic alignment and conflict resolution are introduced to enhance the rule interpretation process based on predefined domain knowledge and unsu-pervised learning techniques. Finally, an algorithm is developed to identify the proper SPARQL function for each rule, and then to generate SPARQL-based queries for model checking purposes, thereby making it possible to interpret complex rules where extra implicit data needs to be inferred. Experiments show that the proposed framework and methods successfully filled the semantic gaps between design models and regulatory texts with domain knowledge, which achieves a 90.1% accuracy and substantially outperforms the commonly used keyword matching method. In addition, the proposed rule interpretation method proves to be 5 times faster than the manual interpretation by domain experts.

59,J,"DeGraff, M","Language Acquisition in Creolization and, Thus, Language Change: Some Cartesian-Uniformitarian Boundary Conditions",Article,,CREOLE; INTERLANGUAGES; TRANSMISSION; GENESIS,"This essay prescribes some broad 'Cartesian-Uniformitarian' boundary conditions for linguistic hypotheses about Creole formation. These conditions make constructive connections between Creole studies, historical linguistics and language-acquisition research. Here 'Cartesian' has a mentalist sense, as in Chomsky (1966): I consider the formation of so-called 'Creole' languages to be ultimately reducible to the creation, in certain sociohistorical contexts, of certain idiolects (i.e., individual internal, or 'I-', languages) in the minds of the 'first Creole speakers'. To avoid circularity, my use of the term 'Creole' in the phrase 'first Creole speakers' combines some of its original ethno-historical senses: I use the word 'Creole', in this particular context, to refer to the non-indigenous people of African or European descent that were born and raised in the colonial New World, in opposition to those that were born and raised in the Old Worlds of Africa and Europe. The term 'Uniformitarian' evokes Neogrammarian approaches to language change, as advocated, for example, by Osthoff and Brugmann (1878) and Paul (1890). It summarizes my fundamental working assumption that no sui generis or exceptional linguistic processes need to be postulated in order to explain the creation of these languages that have come to be labeled 'Creole': these languages were created by the same psycholinguistic mechanisms that are responsible for the creation of (I-) languages, and for linguistic diachronic patterns, everywhere else. Therefore, 'Creole' languages cannot be distinguished a priori from non-'Creole' languages on any linguistic-theoretical criteria - and 'Creole' languages can be genetically classified by the Comparative Method, on a par with non-'Creole' languages. Such assumptions go against popular claims about Creole genesis such as those in, for example, Thomason and Kaufman (1988), Lefebvre (1998) and Bickerton (1999). In establishing these Cartesian-Uniformitarian guidelines, I correct category mistakes that fail to distinguish explanations that apply to I-languages from explanations that apply to E(xternal)-languages and other social-group phenomena that I-languages are implicated in. One such category mistake concerns the ontology and time course of innovations in specific I-languages vs. their spread across populations of I-languages and into E-language communal norms. Then I investigate the possible - and impossible contributions of first-language acquisition and second-language acquisition to 'creolization'. In particular, I take my cues from: (i) studies of language-and dialect-contact situations where children and adults seem to play observably distinct roles; and (ii) recent discoveries about instances of Sign Language acquisition and creation where the Primary Linguistic Data seem remarkably restricted. As for elucidating the limits on the restructuring capacities of children and adults, and their respective contributions to language creation and change, it is epistemologically safer to investigate instances of diachronic development that are more recent than the now unobservable early stages of 'creolization'. Throughout this essay, I use the term 'creolization' strictly as an a-theoretical abbreviation for the longer phrase 'development of these languages that, for sociohistorical reasons, have been labeled Creole '. In the perspective sketched here, creolization is just another instance of language change - or 'language evolution', in Mufwene's (2001, 2008) sense - the investigation of which is to shed light on Universal Grammar.",JUL,2009.0,10.1111/j.1749-818x.2009.00135.x,0.0

If we apply this conception to Husserl's example of two mutually-touching hands of one body we must then state not that we perceive here a coincidence of certain subjective sensations with certain objective qualities, but rather that my body, in the sense of an object, results from a restructuralisation of the whole field of the body accomplished by the body as the performer of perceptual intentions. The body-object, and for the same reasons also the body-subject, is therefore the product of the analysis of the body in the sense of a field of structuralisation or polarisation, not its original phenomenological stratum, as in Husserl. If the body grasps itself as perceptible only by a change of its own structure, inasmuch as it is a certain field of structuralisation, then an external thing, which is likewise a pole of such grasping, must belong to the same ontological field as the body. Merleau-Ponty's flesh, that is the circularity between questioning of perception and answering of the perceived, is thus a phenomenon taking place beyond the boundary of the body as a singular being. This fact allows the concept of flesh to be extended and to be understood as an element, that is, as a dimension in which individual beings only appear.",,2015.0,,

Merleau-Ponty says of his own philosophy that it is founded on the circularity in the body; that is, on the fact that the perceptivity and perception of the body are, from the ontological point of view, one and the same. The inseparability of these two aspects of the body he calls flesh (chair). According to Husserl, I perceive my body such that in a certain perceived object I also understand sensations roused by the perception of that object I observe the consequential parallel between two series of objective and subjective phenomena. Husserl argues that the unity of the body should be expressed as a double unity, and the body as subject-object. In this article I analyse Husserl's example of two hands of the same body touching each other and, in agreement with Merleau-Ponty's philosophy, T attempt to show that the body can appear to itself as an object only on the basis of a differentiation of the body as of a certain field of perceiving. The body as a double unity of subject and object is therefore grounded in the body as a pre-objective and pre-subjective field; that is, in flesh as Merleau-Ponty understands it.

192,J,"Vahdat, V",Meta-Virtuality: Strategies of Disembeddedness in Virtual Interiorities,Article; Early Access,,,"To reclaim their seat in the rapidly growing market of virtual space, designers of the built environment can benefit from reevaluating theories that see the virtual as a mere extension/reflection of the physical. By claiming ontological autonomy from external worlds, the virtual is liberated from the hegemonic control of the physical. To explore the opportunities that such disruption in the physical/virtual continuum offers, I reflect on a series of pedagogical experiments that challenge the myth of total virtuality-the idea that the ultimate virtual experience is total immersion. The persistent obsession to fully immerse the user in a supposedly unmediated interiority of the virtual is evident in the minimization of the virtual reality apparatus to a state of almost nothingness. In this paper, I introduce a series of alienation/defamiliarization strategies, through which designers can invoke awareness about the mediation involved in a virtual experience-a condition that I refer to as metavirtual. One strategy emphasizes the pixelated ontology of the virtual space by techniques of glitching, low-resolution, low-fidelity, and low-color bitmap renders. Another involves manipulating the phenomenological expectations that our perception often experiences in non-virtual environments. This includes, not only a reconceptualization of the spatial object but also revisiting the agency of the subject in the virtual world. Different modes of spatial experience through portals, flying, and teleportation, affect the subject's perception of space, and thereby alter their measurement of time.",,,10.1111/joid.12230,0.0

However, it is still unclear which is the best approach to semantic similarity in this context, since there is no conclusive evaluation of the various measures. Another issue, is whether electronic annotations should or not be used in semantic similarity calculations. Results: We conducted a systematic evaluation of GO-based semantic similarity measures using the relationship with sequence similarity as a means to quantify their performance, and assessed the influence of electronic annotations by testing the measures in the presence and absence of these annotations. We verified that the relationship between semantic and sequence similarity is not linear, but can be well approximated by a rescaled Normal cumulative distribution function. Given that the majority of the semantic similarity measures capture an identical behaviour, but differ in resolution, we used the latter as the main criterion of evaluation. Conclusions: This work has provided a basis for the comparison of several semantic similarity measures, and can aid researchers in choosing the most adequate measure for their work. We have found that the hybrid simGIC was the measure with the best overall performance, followed by Resnik's measure using a best-match average combination approach. We have also found that the average and maximum combination approaches are problematic since both are inherently influenced by the number of terms being combined. We suspect that there may be a direct influence of data circularity in the behaviour of the results including electronic annotations, as a result of functional inference from sequence similarity.",,2008.0,10.1186/1471-2105-9-S5-S4,0.0

Design/methodology/approach This research generates contextual and holistic understandings of multiple project-level cases of BIM adoption through an interpretive paradigm guided by relativist ontology and subjectivist epistemology. Two models of project-level BIM adoption (ten-factor theory of BIM adoption and strategic-contingent model of BIM adoption) were merged to formulate the BIM adoption assessment scale (BIM-AAS). A qualitative-oriented case study protocol was developed to extract valid and reliable data from external and internal project data based on BIM-AAS features. The extracted data were analysed using the pattern-matching technique and cross-case analysis. Findings The results indicate that there was substantial use of BIM tools and technologies in the projects. All the projects adopted collaborative procurement and team and developed integrated building information models. The use of BIM tools, technologies and processes in the projects was found to be above average. The complexities and expectations levels of the projects compliment the nature of BIM adoption in the projects. Research limitations/implications The BIM-AAS adopted in this research is an excellent example of a project-level BIM adoption analytical tool. It can be assumed in future research. Also, this research contributes to the theory that the level of project complexity and expectations must align with the level of BIM adoption in projects. The study's findings ratify BIM tools, technologies and processes as the elements of project-level BIM adoption. Practical implications This research substantiates the actual nature and structure of BIM adoption in Nigeria, thereby simplifying the development of initiatives towards BIM adoption in projects and determining the appropriate strategies for BIM implementation and innovation in the Nigerian construction industry.

Non-physicists should be wary of any claim that modern physics leads us to any particular resolution of this circularity, since even the sample of three theoretical physicists writing this paper hold three divergent views. Some physicists believe that current physics has already found the basic framework for a complete description of reality, and only has to fill in the details. Others suspect that no single framework, from physics or other sources, will ever capture reality. Yet others guess that reality might be approached arbitrarily closely by some form of future physics, but probably based on completely different frameworks. We will designate these three approaches as the fundamentalist, secular and mystic views of the world, as seen by practicing physicists. We present and contrast each of these views, which arguably form broad categories capturing most if not all interpretations of physics.

Furthermore, construction quality information is still recorded on paper, with the risk of document loss and data manipulation, jeopardizing quality accountability. Blockchain has attracted increasing attention from the construction industry because it can record information in an immutable and transparent way and automate some businesses with smart contracts. These properties can tackle information fraud and improve the automation level of OCQI. Unfortunately, very few documented blockchain solutions for OCQI exist. To fill the theoretical knowledge gap, the design thinking approach was adopted to present a blockchain-based conceptual framework. The consortium network and Hyperledger Fabric (HLF) were selected as the suitable blockchain type and development platform for OCQI. The consensus process in HLF and smart contracts-based compliance checking are illustrated. Moreover, the benefits of integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and ontology technology with blockchain are analyzed in detail, which can facilitate the coevaluation of these three technologies.

They usually take off the quantities of material and related work items and assign appropriate unit costs. In this case, unit cost assignment is solely at the engineer's professional discretion. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is widely adopted in the building construction industry. Tools can be used to automate material quantity, minimizing the time necessary for engineers to engage in the quantity measuring process. This function, however, does not provide any information on work items that are related to materials in the Bill of Quantity (BOQ). Thus, engineers still need to verify associated work items and assign unit costs. This research proposes an ontological inference of work item that enables an automated search of the most appropriate work items and their associated unit costs. This ontology contains semantic information for work items and work conditions, as well as a semantic reasoning rule that activates the ontology. A case study confirms that the proposed ontology and semantic reasoning rule can work in real-world situations. This paper contributes by eliminating subjective decision-making via search of appropriate work items for cost estimation and the use of BIM data extracted from IFCXML. The proposed ontological approach to building cost estimation will assist engineers in more readily using BIM data from IFCXML and will be helpful in automation of the whole estimation process.",MAR,2015.0,10.1007/s12205-013-0739-5,0.0

The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) paves the way to address this challenge but the heterogeneity of the represented knowledge about these artifact systems poses a real problem. Ontologies can be considered as part of the solution to overcome the IoT's inherent hurdles. A wise option promoted by recent approaches is to design networks of complementary ontologies. However, different points of view are possible and such diversity could lead to interoperability problems. This article advocates for a networked ontology infrastructure conceived on a principled basis guided by documented judicious conceptualizations. In this regard, this survey points towards ontologies involved in conceptualizations of observations and actuations, where the utility of that conceptualization arises when some features of interest need to be observed or acted upon. For each of the reviewed ontologies, their fundamentals are described, their potential advantages and shortcomings are highlighted, and the use cases where these ontologies have been used are indicated. Additionally, use case examples are annotated with different ontologies in order to illustrate their capabilities and showcase the differences between reviewed ontologies. Finally, this article tries to answer two research questions: Is there a firm basis, broadly admitted by the community, for the development of such a networked ontology infrastructure for the observations and actuations in buildings?

The information needs for creation of digital twins of existing buildings are vast and as such none of the existing research approaches and/or algorithms are capable of holistic data collection to be used as input.

These levels must have conceptualization aspects to define knowledge, a common vocabulary that covers the syntax, symbols, grammars, and axiomatization that captures inference. Our approach inherits the ability of enhancing interoperability at the syntactic and semantic levels of the Semantic web and proposes onto-semantic schemas, which are ontology constructs of concepts of the construction domain.

Their application varies from any approach structured on ontological commitment to meta -level ontologies serving for variety of purposes. This variety continues also in methodologies for constructing the ontologies. There are wide range of ontologies differing in size and complexity that are created with different design criteria. The main point with the ontologies is their structure and ability to serve for the intended purpose. This is only granted with the continuous evaluation of ontologies in the construction process, and also before release or reuse of the ontology. Ontology evaluation methods cluster around two concepts such as verification methods that ensure the structure of the ontology, and validation methods that examine their applicability in real world. In light of these, different approaches as quantitative and qualitative methods are depicted in literature from subjective evaluations by experts to tools, all of which investigate different characteristics of ontologies. Objectives of this study are to underline the importance of ontology evaluation and to present an employed validation method used during ontology development for delay analysis. In this context, first; literature review on ontology evaluation is presented. Second, a delay analysis ontology is introduced with its basics to lay the foundations of the study. Cases taken from the Turkish construction industry are exemplified to explain the utilized ontology validation process. Comparison of the concepts in the constructed ontology with the expert reports written for each case is used to evaluate the ontology.

Four-dimensional (4D) simulation can be considered as a part of a claim management system for representing the responsibility and impact, and can be used as the main scheduling method of claims resolution. Building information modeling (BIM), 4D simulation, delay effects and causes (DEC), and claims are knowledge domains with active research in the construction industry, which are individually described in the literature using taxonomies and ontologies.

Hence, the purpose of this study is to use ontology in the extraction of a partial building information model from the original complete model.

Safety checking which identifies hazards before they occur is a core process of safety management on construction sites. However, the traditional construction safety checking which is operated by the experienced manager is manual and time-consuming. In order to integrate new technology into the construction safety checking system, a meta model for construction safety checking i.e. CSCOntology (Construction Safety Checking Ontology) has been developed in this paper. This model is formalized using an ontology language, OWL for encoding knowledge over the Web. Safety checking constraints which can extract from construction safety regulation provisions are represented with a rule language, SWRL. Then the construction safety checking processes are implemented in the JESS, a rule engine for the Java platform by transforming OWL knowledge into JESS facts, and SWRL constraints into JESS rules. A real-world example has been demonstrated in Protege 3.4 beta to show the proposed safety checking process, according to the regulation examples taken from 29 CFR 1926 OSHA Construction Industry Regulations.

This information is generally embedded into the BIM model as properties for parametric building objects, and is exchangeable among project stakeholders and BIM design programs a key feature of BIM for enhancing communication and work efficiency. However, BIM itself is a purpose-built, product-centric information database and lacks domain semantics such that extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information for the purpose of construction workface planning still remains a challenge. Moreover, some information crucial to construction practitioners, such as the topological relationships among building objects, remains implicit in the BIM design model. This restricts information extraction from the BIM model for downstream analyses in construction. To address identified limitations, this study proposes an ontology-based semantic approach to extracting construction-oriented quantity take-off information from a BIM design model. This approach allows users to semantically query the BIM design model using a domain vocabulary, capitalizing on building product ontology formalized from construction perspectives. As such, quantity take-off information relevant to construction practitioners can be readily extracted and visualized in 3D in order to serve application needs in the construction field. A prototype application is implemented in Autodesk Revit to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed new approach in the domain of light-frame building construction. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Building information model (BIM) based workflows for historical buildings accumulate some of the data sets in a shared information model that contains the building's geometry assemblies with associated attributes (such as material). A BIM model of any building can be a source of data for different engineering assessments, for example, solar and wind exposure and seismic vulnerability, but for historic buildings it is particularly important for interventions like conservation, rehabilitation, and improvements such as refurbishment and retrofitting. When the BIM model is abstracted to a semantic model, enabling the use of semantic technologies such as reasoning and querying, semantic links can be established to other historical contexts. The semantic technologies help historic building experts to aggregate data into meaningful form. Ontologies provide them with an accurate knowledge representation of the concepts, relationships, and rules related to the historic building. In the paper, we are proposing an improved workflow for the transformation of a heritage BIM model to a semantic model. In the BIM part the workflow demonstrates how the fully parametric modelling of historical building components is relevant, for example, in terms of reusability and adaptation to a different context.

This calls for improved urban models that can generate new knowledge and enhance practical skill. Importantly, any urban model embodies a conception of the relation between humans and the physical environment. In urban modeling this is typically conceived of as a relation between human subjects and an environmental object, thereby reproducing a humansenvironment dichotomy. Alternative modeling traditions, such as space syntax that originates in architecture rather than geography, have tried to overcome this dichotomy. Central in this effort is the development of new representations of urban space, such as in the case of space syntax, the axial map. This form of representation aims to integrate both human behavior and the physical environment into one and the same description. Interestingly, models based on these representations have proved to better capture pedestrian movement than regular models. Pedestrian movement, as well as other kinds of human flows in urban space, is essential for urban modeling, since increasingly flows of this kind are understood as the driver in urban processes. Critical for a full understanding of space syntax modeling is the ontology of its' representations, such as the axial map. Space syntax theory here often refers to James Gibson's Theory of affordances, where the concept of affordances, in a manner similar to axial maps, aims to bridge the subject-object dichotomy by neither constituting physical properties of the environment or human behavior, but rather what emerges in the meeting between the two. In extension of this, the axial map can be interpreted as a representation of how the physical form of the environment affords human accessibility and visibility in urban space. This paper presents a close examination of the form of representations developed in space syntax methodology, in particular in the light of Gibson's theory of affordances. The overarching aim is to contribute to a theoretical framework for urban models based on affordances, which may support the overcoming of the subject-object dichotomy in suchmodels, here deemed essential for a greater social-ecological sustainability of cities.",APR 20,2018.0,10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00449,0.0

In this work, we aim to provide an initial approach to the question of how to model architectural data in a formal ontology structure and consider some of the problems involved. This question is challenging both for the inherent difficulties of the discourse to be modelled but also for the lack of available structured data sources that would distinctly represent the architectural perspective proper, as well as for the contentious nature of the definition of architecture itself. We, therefore, take the step of exploring in broad strokes the possible approaches to architecture, tracing the notion of architecture as idea, process or thing from the literature. On the basis of this enquiry, we propose a model of some top-level referents of architecture using FRBRoo, an extension of CIDOC CRM that can be used to model creative processes. We argue that with the addition of only four classes to this model, to capture certain architecturally specific concepts and activities, we are able to provide an adequate high-level first approach to this problem.

The case study provided qualitative insights into how the proposed framework can contribute to a more structured requirements management of a construction project with a focus on the energy-efficient design of buildings. It can be seen that the proposed framework for requirements management of energy performance provides a structure for designers to consider and apply energy performance criteria in the early design stages and visualize the consequences of alternative design solutions for clients, engineers, contractors and suppliers. The use of a requirements structure enables the transparency of different design alternatives against the established functional requirements of energy performance for the stakeholders in the design process.

Within a single industrial domain, there exist many taxonomies that are intended for different applications. Industry specific taxonomies often represent the vocabularies that are commonly used by the practitioners. Their jobs are multi-faceted, which include checking for code and regulatory compliance. As such, it will be very desirable if industry practitioners are able to easily locate and browse regulations of interest. In practice, multiple sources of government regulations exist and they are often organized and classified by the needs of the issuing agencies that enforce them rather than the needs of the communities that use them. One way to bridge these two distinct needs is to develop methods and tools that enable practitioners to browse and retrieve government regulations using their own terms and vocabularies, for example, via existing industry taxonomies. The mapping from a single taxonomy to a single regulation is a trivial keyword matching task. We examine a relatedness analysis approach for mapping a single taxonomy to multiple regulations. We then present an approach for mapping multiple taxonomies to a single regulation by measuring the relatedness of concepts. Cosine similarity, Jaccard coefficient and market basket analysis are used to measure the semantic relatedness between concepts from two different taxonomies. Preliminary evaluations of the three relatedness analysis measures are performed using examples from the civil engineering and building industry.

To therefore ease the description of geometric data in a Semantic Web context, we conduct an extensive literature review and analyse the identified, oftentimes isolated implementations for geometry descriptions in that context, with focus on requirements set by domain-specific use cases. Based on this analysis, we group the currently available implementations into approaches and compare them to offer means for deciding on which approach or implementation suits individual use cases.

I first analyze Husserl's account of the body as a two-fold unity and demonstrate the problematic nature of its four implications, namely, the ambiguous ontological status of the body as subject-object, the view of my body as my object, the preconstitutive character of the unity of the body, and the restriction of the constitution of the body to touch alone. Building on this analysis, I explain how Merleau-Ponty resolves the difficulties raised by Husserl's account by reversing it. According to Merleau-Ponty, flesh is not a two-fold reality comprising subjective and objective aspects, but an ontological dimension from which these aspects can be abstracted through specific cognitive operations. Consequently, all subjective and objective aspects, even beyond the boundaries of one's body, must be understood as founded in the indivisible unity of flesh. I argue that a thorough phenomenological description of the human body requires abandoning Husserl's concept of Leib because it contributes to perpetuating subject-object dualism.

These technologies are typically considered as complementary to existing and often used Building Information Modelling (BIM) software. The usage of these technologies in the AEC domains is thereby motivated by (1) a desire to overcome the interoperability issue among software tools used in diverse disciplines, or at least improve information exchange processes; (2) a desire to connect to various domains of application that have opportunities to identify untapped valuable resources closely linked to the information already obtained in,the AEC domains; and/or (3) a desire to exploit the logical basis of these technologies, which is currently undisclosed in the AEC domains. Through an extensive literature study and survey, this article investigates the development and application progress of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains in accordance with these three primary perspectives. These examinations and analyses provide a complete strategical map that can serve as a robust stepping stone for future research regarding the application of semantic web technologies in the AEC domains.

To reach this goal, it is necessary to use open standards for model exchange such as the Industry Foundation Classes ( IFC). The non-profit organization buildingSMART defines this standard. IFC provides object types and attributes, which describe properties of objects. The IFC standard do not address possible values for attributes; but beside coordinated names for object types and attributes, coordinated values for attributes are required. This is necessary for the evaluation of digital models for different purposes. Several approaches in the fields of ontology and classification systems address this issue. However, at present time there is no clear distinction between prerequisites that modeled objects have to fulfill and products, which satisfy these requirements. Suppliers or construction companies at the interface between planning and construction propose products for the modelled requirements of the planning process.

The theory of emergence (EM), and downward causation (DC) in particular, bring a new set of arguments challenging not only methodological, but also ontological and causal reductionism. This argumentation provides a crucial philosophical foundation for the science/theology dialogue. However, a closer examination shows that proponents of EM do not present a unified and consistent definition of DC. Moreover, they find it difficult to prove that higher-order properties can be causally significant without violating the causal laws that operate at lower physical levels. They also face the problem of circularity and incoherence in their explanation. In our article we show that these problems can be overcome only if DC is understood in terms of formal rather than physical (efficient) causality.

Here, we use the postindustrial landscape of Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula-a former copper-mining district-to illustrate how vernacular preservation differs from formal historic preservation, reviewing the process of vernacular preservation and how it is activated in practice. Vernacular preservation constitutes perhaps the most traditional, common, and widespread mechanism of material conservation of the historical built environment yet has been largely invisible, little discussed, and undertheorized by the heritage preservation community. Understanding this preservation process begins by acknowledging its existence and by extending the heritage dialogue to include these underrepresented historical properties and their important role in defining postindustrial landscapes. We conclude the paper with a discussion on how this novel approach to thinking about preservation extends broadly to the field and should be given greater attention.",SPR,2017.0,10.1353/cot.2017.0006,0.0

Through this curious concept the autor is capable of fulfilling, as we aim to demonstrate, an innovative phenomenological description of the worldly horizon as belonging, equiprimordialy (gleichursprunglich), to the existence. The philosopher can thus prescind from the traditional starting point - verificable on the Husserlian phenomenology - that typically establishes the ego as constitutive subject: fundament that access the world, its object, based on the theoretical and intelectual paradigm. On the other hand, the explanation of the familiar and habitual access to the world will be started, in Sein und Zeit (based on the proposal of an diverse Fundierungszusammenhang), by the consideration of the emphasized practical-equipmental aspects of the worldliness. The circularity that arises from the Besorgen expresses now the intentional aspect phenomenally adequate to the description of the mobility of factical life. Following the Heideggerian thesis and with the help from commentators, we aim to expose in this article the main arguments of that equipmental approach: starting from the study of the question of the ontical referentiality we'll reach in the end the heart of the ontological reduction performed on 18. This thematic outline will allow us to understand, finally, some elementary points that show the radicality of that inversion of the phenomenological-method, exactly in the sense that the circular practicalpragmatical attitude reveals the space that separate our author from his master Husserl: in the center of their different understandings of the philosophical task.",SEP-DEC,2019.0,10.18012/arf.2019.46216,0.0

I focus on the relation between transcendental and metaphysical deductions in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and on the problem of epistemic foundationalism and categoriality in Husserl's Sixth Logical Investigation. I propose that the strategy of circularity is manifested through the peculiar self-enclosure of the categories of transcendental deduction vis-a-vis metaphysical deduction (Kant) and categorial intuition vis-a-vis sensuous intuition (Husserl). Although it is usually regarded as a deficient and damaging occurrence in argumentation, circularity appears to be a crucial component in the analysis of both thinkers. The analytical realms recognized by both these thinkers, is acknowledged as continually dependent upon the self-evidential contingency of the realms they are supposed to hierarchically overarch. The strict separation between the transcendental and phenomenological realms and their addressees appears to be founded on mutual circularity, where the relation between investigator and investigated extends beyond their separation and reconciliation. Both Kant and Husserl, through the circular relationship with empiricism-rationalism and psychologism radically re-articulated the logic-ontology and founding-founded polarities.",,2018.0,10.21638/2226-5260-2018-7-1-32-56,0.0

The main philosophical positions I will discuss are Husserl's phenomenology of the ego in his later transcendental phase, the Heideggerean view of the nature of Dasein, and Sartre's approach of the Being-for-itself as mainly exposed in Being and Nothingness. The central idea defended throughout this article is that self-constituting temporality as immanently induced may serve as a common foundation of the nature of the transcendental ego both in the Husserlian phenomenology and in the Heideggerean and Sartrean alternative positions; further, I will hold that, as consequence, the ultimate question about the possibility of an ontology of the pure ego is transposed to the question of the origin and foundation of inner temporality. Yet, in this case one is set to face anew the circularity of an infinite regression in terms of reflecting-reflected and the inevitability of the subjective character of the origin of temporality. Besides this key question-a primary issue of this article-I will address the issue of the convergences and differences regarding aspects of the essential nature of the Husserlian ego, the Heideggerean Dasein, and the Sartrean Being-for-itself, especially regarding the widely debated topic of the 'exteriority' of the latter two 'egological' concepts with regard to the world in contrast to the 'interiority' of the Husserlian absolute ego.",,2019.0,10.21638/2226-5260-2019-8-2-573-601,0.0

In the closing section, the essay questions the possibilities of arguing a rigorously founded rational theology. The general objective of this study is to demonstrate that a fertile dialogue between philosophy and religion is possible. In this dialogue, philosophy opens up and protects a space for religious experience. Indeed, religious choice stems both from the possibility allowed by philosophy of making meta-empirical inference and from the incapacity of metaphysical speculation to say, in positive terms, what the absolute is.",OCT-DEC,2020.0,10.26350/001050_000159,0.0

Part II, Was the Later Carnap a Proponent of Epistemicism?",Article,ontology; metaontology; deflationism; Camap; fictionalism; epistemicism,,"Piotr Warzoszczak, The Later Carnap and Contemporary Metaphysical Debates. Part II, Was the Later Carnap a Proponent of Epistemicism? In the paper I consider the prospects of interpreting late Carnap views on ontology as being in part a sort of epistemism. More precisely, I argue that the theses that he maintained in the Empirism, Semantics, and Onotology and the volume of The Library of Living Philosophers devoted to his philosophy put him close to proponents of epistemicism, according to which ontological debates over truth-values of metaphysical theses need not to be verbal disputes, but the prospects of resolving them are meager, since there are no evidences that could support either given metaphysical thesis or its negation. Most likely, Carnap should be read as a proponent of a more radical version of this view, since he maintained that in principle there are no such evidences. I find this view fit well with Carnap's argumentative strategy against substantial character of metaphysical debates, since he stresses the lack of evidences in favour of or against metaphysical claims as the main reason for his deflationism in ontology. However, what is the most worrisome in taking this route of interpreting late Carnap views on ontology is that among the presuppositions of epistemicism is the thesis that one can make sense of the talk about truth-values of metaphysical claims, whereas Carnap maintained they lack truth-values due to lack of cognitive contents. But taking the change of his view on the nature of semantic values in the volume of The Library of Living Philosophers devoted to his philosophy, where he claimed that extralinguistic entities should serve a role of semantic values and the notion of truth should be defined relatively to a given interpretation in a given model, I find his opinion on metaphysical claims unjustified, since one can define the the notion of truth for these claims relatively to models and hence make a talk about their truth values (relatively to models) sensible. It doesn't follow from that that one can also make a sense of a claim being absolutely true, since it would require to take one model to be special one in the sense that it fits the way reality is, which is something that the proponent of epistemicism deny on the ground that there are no evidences that could be taken to show that one of the models of a given language is special in this respect. I also discuss applications of the inference to the best explanation in argumentation in favour of various sorts of realism and argue:that this kind of argumentation always leaves room for some ontological dispute between parties from which one deny the existence of entities that the other argued for through application of the inference to the best explanation and hence that no metaphysical debate can be resolved by application of the inference to the best explanation under the threat of circularity. The paper is the continuation of considerations made in my paper The Later Carnap and Contemporary Metaphysical Debates.

210,J,"Marton, B",The trialectics of spatiality,Article,spatiality; social constructivism; trialectics; Henri Lefebvre; Edward Soja,,"The theorisation of space and spatiality is one of the recurring motifs in geographical enquiry. In the Hungarian context, however, relatively little attention has been paid to concepts that emerged after human geography's behavioural turn and the subsequent studies of people's mental maps. Constituting a significant theoretical gap, the contributions of neomarxist and poststructuralist scholars to contemporary discourses on space and spatiality left Hungarian human geography - apart from some notable exceptions - almost untouched. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to introduce the trialectics of spatiality, a concept less comprehensively discussed in the Hungarian literature to date, albeit being highly influential in Western human geography. This theoretical frame originates from two main sources: on the one hand, from social constructivist approaches rapidly evolving within the social sciences from the 1970s, and on the other hand, from trialectical thinking rooted in postmodern intellectual currents. After the concise overview of these sources, the concept of the trialectics of spatiality is presented primarily based on the related works of two authors, French neomarxist philosopher, sociologist and urban theorist Henri Lefebvre and American geographer Edward Soja. One of the most influential theories of social space ('the social production of space') stems from Henri Lefebvre whose spatial triad has been adapted and further elaborated by Edward Soja. One of Soja's most important contributions to the Lefebvrian concept is the notion of trialectics that goes beyond the conventional way of dualistic thinking and challenges the binary divisions modernism has created (and thus, the reduction and totalisation of social realities). Soja proposes two kinds of trialectics; one of these is concerned with ontology ('the trialectics of being'), whereas the other deals with epistemology ('the trialectics of spatiality'). Firstly, all human beings exist in space, in a specific period of time and as part of a certain society. On the other hand, focusing on space and spatiality, Soja distinguishes between perceived, conceived and lived space, referring to these as 'Firstspace', 'Secondspace' and 'Thirdspace' in his work. These three different aspects of spatiality are space as perceived, space as conceived, and space as directly lived and experienced. Additionally, in Soja's reading, Thirdspace is also considered as the space of resistance, by providing opportunities to react against hegemonic power structures that are both associated with Firstspace (by certain architectural features of the built environment), and with the political and ideological use of Secondspace. Finally, concerning the nexus of the three aspects of spatiality, it is important to underscore that these should not be understood as static categories; on the contrary, even Lefebvre described them as dynamic, action-oriented modes of 'perceiving', 'conceiving', and 'living' space. Furthermore, these are intricately interrelated as well, with each one of the three elements constantly shaping the other two. Hence, certain spaces are always perceived, conceived and lived at the same time, and as such, they might constitute Firstspace, Secondspace or Thirdspace only for different social groups. Yet, as pointed out by Lefebvre, analyses focusing on only one aspect of spatiality are inherently reductive and homogenising. Consequently, in order to gain a deeper understanding of the spatiality of society, all three elements of Lefebvre's and Soja's shared concept ought to be taken into account.",,2015.0,10.17649/TET.29.2.2658,0.0

A challenging key issue in the implementation of a circular economy is ensuring coordination, control and transparency within a network of parties. Traceability models and systems are vital pillars of such an endeavor, but a preliminary search of the available literature revealed a rather unstable and fragmented research field and practice. The objective of this systematic review was to examine those studies discussing traceability models and traceability systems while connecting traceability capacities and outputs to implement the principles of the circular economy.

To manage knowledge effectively, various information technology (IT) models and systems have been developed for knowledge management (KM) in the construction industry over the years. As the next generation of IT application in construction, building information modeling (BIM) is increasingly used today to aid KM. Compared to generic IT tools, BIM has some distinctive features, such as parametric modeling, virtual visualization and centralized platform. However, how to apply these features of BIM to better serve KM has not yet been well summarized and analyzed. In this research, 115 papers on IT-based KM and 73 papers on BIM-supported KM are reviewed, based on which an integrated framework is developed to describe the current status and future directions for KM in IT-generic and BIM-specific contexts. It is followed by a conceptual model of BIM-supported KM which shows the possible KM factors and their relationships in the BIM environment. This research highlights the transformation from IT-based KM into BIM-supported KM. It contributes to the identification of remaining challenges to BIM-supported KM and the elaboration of BIM-supported KM in construction research and practice. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

At the same time, it is the sector with the highest cost and environmental saving potentials provided effective strategies are implemented. The emerging Semantic Web promises new opportunities for efficient management of information and knowledge about various domains. While other domains, particularly bioinformatics have fully embraced the Semantic Web, knowledge about how the same has been applied to the built environment is sketchy. This study investigates the development and trend of Semantic Web applications in the built environment Understanding the different applications of the Semantic Web is essential for evaluation, improvement and opening of new research. A review of over 120 refereed articles on built environment Semantic Web applications has been conducted. A classification of the different Semantic Web applications in relation to their year of application is presented to highlight the trend. Two major findings have emerged. Firstly, despite limited research about easy-to-use applications, progress is being made from often too-common ontological concepts to more innovative concepts such as Linked Data. Secondly, a shift from traditional construction applications to Semantic Web sustainable construction applications is gradually emerging. To conclude, research challenges, potential future development and research directions have been discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This research aimed at developing a method for slum detection based on the morphology of the built environment. The method consists of segmentation followed by hierarchical classification using object-oriented image analysis and integrating expert knowledge in the form of a local slum ontology. Results show that textural feature contrast derived from a grey-level co-occurrence matrix was useful for delineating segments of slum areas or parts thereof. Spatial metrics such as the size of segments and proportions of vegetation and built-up were used for slum detection. The percentage of agreement between the reference layer and slum classification was 60 percent. This is lower than the accuracy achieved for land cover classification (80.8 percent), due to large variations. We conclude that the method produces useful results and has potential for successful application in contexts with similar morphology.",SEP,2016.0,10.1080/14498596.2016.1138247,0.0

In comparison to green-field construction projects, adaptive reuse projects require distinct stages, definition of interfaces, decision gates, and planning methods in order to secure the success of the building project. Unfortunately, little research has been done regarding establishing feasible systems for the planning, assessment, and management of adaptive reuse projects, leading to underperforming building projects outcomes. Interface management (IM) can improve renovation projects outcomes by defining appropriate ways to identify, record, monitor, and track project interfaces. IM has the potential of bringing cost and time benefits during adaptive reuse projects execution. The aim of this study is to develop a reference framework for implementing IM for adaptive reuse projects. First, the inefficiencies of redevelopment projects are explained inside of a circular economy (CE) context. Second, an ontology of IM for adaptive reuse projects is defined based on the current barriers to adaptive reuse and the most common interface problems in construction projects. Third, the defined ontology is expanded through a case study by showing examples of adaptive reuse barriers on a case project, and how IM could have been part of the solution for these problems. Finally, this study concludes with the suggestions on interface management systems (IMS) implementation for future adaptive reuse projects.",MAY,2019.0,10.3390/buildings9050105,0.0

Twenty-two in-depth interviews form the primary evidence of the case studies. The methodology incorporates network analysis of concepts that influence energy use to formalize the case studies and collect additional knowledge. The framework comprises thirteen construction activities and twenty-one systems and factors related to design, resources and site characteristics, specific to the construction domain. This set of concepts can influence the energy consumption during the construction phase. Although these concepts are present in nearly every project, their dynamics and their inter-relations with project-specific systems change, depending on the context of the project. The proposed method, which employs network analysis, help identify their interrelationships and relative importance of these concepts. In addition to the opportunities and lessons learned that can guide future energy assessments and improve energy use in construction projects, the results show how promising network analytics is to obtain knowledge usually difficult to perceive in traditional knowledge processes. Besides, this work highlights the importance of supporting collaboration between project team members to study and decide on the plans to manage/reduce energy consumption during the construction phase in oil and gas facilities. While the energy savings are smaller than the upstream and operation phases, it has received much less attention. It is also a phase with much more subjective and contextualized knowledge making the use of case-based analyses more suitable. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The concept of Job Hazard Analysis is commonly used to mitigate and control these occupational hazards. This technique analyzes the major tasks in a construction activity, identifies all potential task-related hazards, and suggests safe approaches to reduce or avoid each of these hazards. In this paper, the authors explore the possibility of leveraging existing construction safety resources to assist JHA, aiming to reduce the level of human effort required. Specifically, the authors apply ontology-based text classification (TC) to match safe approaches identified in existing resources with unsafe scenarios. These safe approaches can serve as initial references and enrich the solution space when performing JHA. Various document modification strategies are applied to existing resources in order to achieve superior TC effectiveness. The end result of this research is a construction safety domain ontology and its underlying knowledge base. A user scenario is also discussed to demonstrate how the ontology supports JHA in practice.

14,J,"Spreafico, C; Spreafico, M",Using text mining to retrieve information about circular economy,Article,Circular economy; Text mining; Dependency patterns; Patents,,"This paper proposes a method of text mining to automatically retrieve knowledge from patents on how to recycle and reuse a waste. The main novelties are the introduction of a set of specific dependency patterns and the introduction of a partially revised TRIZ (Russian acronym for T spacing diaeresis heory of Inventive Problem Solving) spacing diaeresis ontology to classify the retrieved information. The proposed dependency patterns were manually extracted from a sample patents pool about waste recycling and reuse. The classification of the information is based on different classes: (1) what transformations can be carried out on the waste, (2) what technologies can be used to carry out these transformations, (3) what products can be obtained by transforming the waste, (4) what functions can be carried out by the waste, (5) with which technologies, and (6) on which entities. An automatic implementation of the proposed method, involving the manual check of the retrieved results, was tested through a case study about wood chip recycling and reuse. Compared to the dependency patterns from the literature, the proposed ones allowed to retrieve 28 % more pertinent information. This results mainly depends by better ability of the proposed patterns to better discriminate the relevant sentences from which to extract information, compared to the other patterns (i.e. + 40 %). The automatic classification of the information was also correctly performed: in almost each class, precision and recall were higher than 60 % and on average equal to 90 %. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

However, in order to increase the economic viability of the obtained microalgae biomass from a production plant coupled to a coal power plant, a proteomic approach was initiated by using fresh and atomized microalgae samples, as the main used commercial forms. Above 51,000 high quality spectra were obtained per sample in the MS/MS analysis of whole proteome of N. gaditana, yielding above 7,500 peptides, leading the identification of 1,950 proteins, from the N. gaditana protein database, where 655 proteins were presented in all the replicates. The identified proteins were categorized according to gene ontology classification by molecular function and biological process. In this study, it has been described the first proteomic analysis of the microalgae N. gaditana under industrial conditions containing an important number of identified proteins. A significative presence of proteins with a potential role in different agri-food and biomedical applications was detected and studied being the core of future N. gaditana research to expand the current biotechnological applications of this microalga.

58,J,"Mendonca, D",What a difference depth makes,Article,Emotional depth; Narrative structure; Profound; Emotional perspective; Rationality,,"The article explores how a new dimension of emotion - depth - is crucially important for a better understanding of emotion and its connection to rationality. It begins by identifying that depth is trapped in a circularity in which deep emotions are important because they refer to deep and important aspects of people's lives. Following Danto's discussion of deep interpretation (1981), it suggests that it is the contrast between deep and superficial that grants emotional perspective and the ability to identify levels of emotional depth. After arguing that the emotional perspective is grasped by the narrative structure of emotion, it raises several objections that provide the ground to establish a difference between deep and profound. Then the paper concludes that the meaning of emotional depth is only fully understood in the ongoing contrast with the superficial described before, and states how further research on depth of emotion may provide the key to understanding the ambivalent status of emotions regarding their link to rationality.",SEP-DEC,2019.0,10.7213/1980-5934.31.054.DS01,0.0

Implementation, however, is often controversial. In 2018, a Swedish governmental inquiry was commissioned to propose a complete ban on land application of sewage sludge to reduce soil pollution and increase phosphorus recovery. In 2020, the inquiry suggested two pathways, one to ban all land application, and one where agricultural land use should continuously be allowed. This paper is based on interviews with experts tied to the inquiry where they reference to sewage sludge, related objects, and future management. The inquiry's inability to propose a coherent suggestion is analysed inspired by the concept of multiple ontology. Several ontological versions of sewage sludge emerge that unveil tensions between concepts of danger and cleanliness, pollution and naturalness, often captured in previous studies of waste. Some versions of sewage sludge conflict, which can explain the difficulty to establish an ontologically singular knowledge base for a transformation of sewage sludge from waste to resource. Though most of the experts agree that circular economy and nutrient recycling are good things, policymaking is caught in an ontological conundrum.",JUL 3,2022.0,10.1080/23251042.2021.2021603,0.0
205,B,"Menacere, K",When more does not mean better Selecting a research methodology and methods,Article; Book Chapter,,RESEARCH PARADIGMS; QUALITATIVE RESEARCH,"Novice researchers often experience a taxing and stressful time in their attempts to select the appropriate methodology and methods for their research. The extensive literature on the subject is overburdened by too much 'academism and obscurantism', compounded by conflicting positions, to the detriment of transparency and consistency in the use of user-friendly language. The tangle in the debate arises from a failure to recognise that some of the terms employed around key methodology and methods are used by authors in differing and often random and interchangeable ways. This chapter aims to highlight the academic inconsistencies and clarify the muddled jargon that generates key terminological and definitional issues. It seeks to guide novice researchers through the methodology maze, particularly as there is an increasing pluralism of alternative methodologies emerging, and to enable them to make a more informed decision about their methodological choices. It attempts to delineate the paradigm boundaries, seeking a connection between the ontology, epistemology, methodology and methods of each paradigm. In addition, it explores some underlying assumptions in research that impact on researchers' worldviews, theoretical frameworks and study designs. This chapter argues that defining methodology and paradigms is less important than understanding their nature and considering their functions. It aims at encouraging greater methodological awareness and understanding for better practice.",,2016.0,,
