The experimental results show that the direct unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine fuel cell reaches a maximum power density of 129 mW.cm−2 at a current density of 234 mA.cm−2, a limiting current density of about 420 mA.cm−2, and an open circuit voltage of up to 1.37 V. The cell performance reaches a good state at a NaOH concentration of 2.0 M and 5.0 M in the low and high current density region, respectively.

The urgency of their development, new improvements to existing beam structures and their application is substantiated. Proposed beams which made of a composite I-beam, but with a split section of individual elements. Particular attention is paid to collapsible products and the possibility of their delivery to the installation site in “unrolled” form, assembly and installation at the construction site, dismantling (if necessary) and reuse. Fastening between themselves is carried out on self-tapping screws or bolts, which allows assembly at the installation site. To increase the rigidity of the profiled sheet wall without significant changes in the geometric parameters, including the wall thickness, it will be sufficient to use additional profiled sheet layers for strengthening. This article discusses the bearing capacity of such beams. The software package ANSYS was used. The geometric model of the beam has been created. To check the functionality of the program, an initial calculation was made. The calculation of ten options of the beam has been made. The first three options consider three types of profiled sheet used as a wall of I-beam. Based on the calculation results, the second version of the profiled sheet was selected for the next four calculation options for different corrugation heights and three calculation options for different spans. The results of calculating all 10 options are summarized in a single table for ease of analysis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","ANSYS software package; Bearing capacity; Corrugated sheet; Corrugated wall; Displacements; Normal and shear stresses; Prefabricated steel structures; Profiled sheet; Stress–strain state","Shear stress; Software packages; Steel structures; ANSYS software package; Corrugated sheets; Corrugated wall; Corrugated web; Displacement; Installation site; Normal and shear stress; Prefabricated steel structure; Profiled sheet; Stress strain state; Bearing capacity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119839477

In this paper, a hybrid parallel Harris hawks optimization (HPHHO) algorithm is proposed to address the problem. HPHHO aims to enhance the performance of existing Harris hawks optimization (HHO) algorithm by three strategies including oppositional learning, smoothing technique and parallel optimization mechanism. At the beginning of each iteration, the opposite population is calculated from the current population by the oppositional learning strategy. Following that, the individuals in the two populations are arranged in ascending order on the basis of the fitness function values, and the top half of the resulting population is selected as the initial population. The selected initial population is divided into two equal subpopulations which are assigned to the differential evolution and the HHO algorithm, respectively. The both algorithms operate in parallel to search and update the solutions of each subpopulation simultaneously. Then the solutions are smoothed for each iteration by the smoothing technique to reduce fluctuations. As a result, the optimal solution obtained by the parallel optimization mechanism avoids falling into local optima. The performance of HPHHO is evaluated by 4 CEC 2005 benchmark functions and 3 constrained continuous optimal control problems, showing better efficiency and robustness in terms of performance metrics, convergence rate and stability. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective, practical and feasible in solving the RLV reentry trajectory optimization problem. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Hybrid parallel Harris hawks optimization; Oppositional learning; Parallel optimization mechanism; Reentry trajectory optimization; Smoothing technique","Aerodynamics; Benchmarking; Evolutionary algorithms; Launch vehicles; Optimal control systems; Optimization; Reentry; Reusability; Reusable rockets; Steel beams and girders; Trajectories; Differential Evolution; Nonlinear dynamic characteristics; Optimal control problem; Optimization algorithms; Parallel optimization; Re-usable launch vehicles (RLV); Reentry trajectory optimizations; Reusable launch vehicles; Iterative methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114598383

This regenerative approach contrasts with the traditional linear economy, which has been adopted by the construction industry. Developing new construction technologies for sustainable built environment is a top priority for the construction industry throughout the world. Much of the environmental impact from the construction industry is associated with the consumption of resources and generation of waste. The construction industry in Europe consumes over 70,000 million tonnes of materials each year and generates over 250 million tonnes of waste. Composite flooring formed by connecting the concrete slabs to the supporting steel beams has been widely used for many years and is well established as one of the most efficient floor systems in multi-storey steel frame building structures. However, shear connectors are welded through the steel decking to the steel beams and cast into the concrete; this made deconstruction and reuse of these components almost impossible. A new composite flooring system which allows for the reuse of the steel beams and composite floor slabs is developed and tested to assess its potential and suitability for reuse. This paper presents the results of a series of full-scale beam tests and demonstrates the reusability of this new form of composite flooring systems. Simplified hand calculations are also provided and compared against beam tests.

Compared with photocatalysis under UV irradiation, VUV photocatalysis exhibited higher photodegradation efficiency due to the synergetic effect of direct photolysis, indirect photooxidation and photocatalytic oxidation. The synthesized TiO2/SBA-15 catalysts exhibited ordered mesoporous structure and anatase phase TiO2. Titanium content, initial pH and substrate concentration impacted degradation efficiency of UDMH in the VUV photocatalysis process. Among the prepared catalysts, TiO2/SBA-15 with the molar ratio of Ti/Si = 1 : 3 (TS-2) showed the best photocatalytic activity under VUV light, with the rate constant of 0.02511 min−1, which is 1.91 times that with VUV/P25. The superior photocatalytic activity of TS-2 is mainly related to the good balance between the specific surface area and TiO2contents. The photodegradation efficiency decreases with the increase in the initial UDMH concentration and the maximum degradation rate was obtained at pH 9.0. In the VUV/TS-2 process, ˙OH played a more important role in the degradation of UDMH than ˙O2−and the degradation pathways contained bond breaking, amidation, isomerisation and oxidation reactions. The TS-2 also showed good reusability with the rate constant maintained at above 90% after five cycles and exhibited satisfactory degradation efficiency in tap water. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.",,"Catalysts; Degradation; Efficiency; Irradiation; Molar ratio; Oxide minerals; Photocatalytic activity; Photolysis; Photooxidation; Rate constants; Reusability; Steel beams and girders; Titanium alloys; Titanium dioxide; Degradation efficiency; Ordered mesoporous structures; Photo catalytic degradation; Photocatalysis process; Photocatalytic oxidations; Photodegradation efficiency; Substrate concentrations; Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine; Photodegradation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111091169

However, despite the environmental benefits involved, additional costs and increased design difficulty limit the application of reuse. This paper proposes an optimal design method that minimizes the CO2 emissions and costs of the noise barrier tunnel. In the proposed method, information on reusable steel beams from the building information modeling data of the noise barrier tunnel is extracted, and the optimization problem is defined. In addition, designs and component procurement plans aiming to minimize CO2 emissions and costs are derived using a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The results of the case study show that depending on the situation, CO2 emissions are reduced from 1% to 92% and costs are reduced by up to 25% relative to the case without reuse. As in previous studies, CO2 emission could be reduced herein through reuse, but an increase in costs was observed in some cases. This study contributes to the literature by providing optimal alternatives for designers through an optimal design method integrating strategies to overcome barriers to the practice of reuse. The case study results also highlight the need for an assessment through the entire life cycle, including the modification and inspection processes of reusable components that are generally excluded. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Life cycle assessment; Life cycle cost; Multi-objective optimization; Noise barrier tunnel; Reuse","Carbon dioxide; Construction industry; Genetic algorithms; Life cycle; Optimal systems; Sustainable development; Tunnels; Case-studies; CO$-2$/ emission; Component reuse; Design optimization; Multi-objectives optimization; Multiobjective genetic algorithms; Noise barrier tunnel; Noise barriers; Optimal design methods; Reuse; Multiobjective optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103313460

The shear connector is essentially used to transfer shear forces across steel beams and concrete slabs in composite structures. However, conventional methods which rely mainly on the welded stud shear connector are not as efficient in terms of recycling and reusing building components. Therefore, to address the issues of deconstruction and materials reuse and to improve the structural performance of the composite beams, bolted shear connectors have been developed to replace the conventional welded stud. In order to further study their behaviour, the structural performance of the bolted shear connectors were simulated and compared with the welded studs using Abaqus software. A tridimensional numerical model was validated using previously conducted experimental tests and was used as a reference for the parametric study. Height to diameter ratio, friction coefficient of steel-concrete interface, and concrete strength were selected as the main variables for the parametric study, along with the effects of the bolt-hole clearance. The results of numerical simulation were used to develop shear stress and ductility criteria of the innovative shear connector for design rules. The results of parametric studies also showed that the load carrying capacity of composite beams using the bolted shear connectors is influenced by the bolt's height, the friction coefficient of contact surfaces and the concrete strength. © 2021","Bolted shear connector; Composite beam; Direct shear tests; Finite element modelling; Headed studs","ABAQUS; Composite beams and girders; Composite structures; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Finite element method; Friction; Numerical models; Shear stress; Structural analysis; Studs (structural members); Welding; 3-d finite element modelling; Bolt-hole clearance; Conventional methods; Design of composites; Friction coefficients; Height-to-diameter ratio; Steel-concrete interface; Structural performance; Bolts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100965549

However, bolted engineering structures often encounter vibration-induced joint faults like self-loosening, crack, leakage and corrosion since they are generally subjected to external dynamic loads caused by vibration environments. Joint damages would seriously affect structures' reliability and durability, and increase maintenance costs. Therefore, fault detection of bolted engineering structures is very important and necessary. For beam-like and ring-type engineering structures with single excitation and multiple damaged bolted joints, various methods monitoring changes in nonlinear structural features have been developed. To avoid the use of structural features from benchmark structures for reference during the derivation of damage indicators, a novel vibration-based fault detection approach utilizing features from damaged structures only is proposed in this study. In the new method, the dynamic model of bolted engineering structures is simplified as a general MDOF model with nonlinear elements simulating nonlinear bolt loosening faults. By changing the value of related mass, three similar equations from the damaged structure are used to form one matrix, and then the singularity of matrix is used to detect the existence and position of faults.

This causes global warming and waste problems. The demand for the reuse of construction materials is increasing, although it is not the convention, to reduce the environmental impact. Although the sustainable effect of the reuse of materials has been proven in several studies, materials are not always reused in practice, owing to the lack of an information system for reusable materials and the economic uncertainty. In this study, we propose a framework for designing structures using reusable steel beams. The design framework consists of a material bank and a design support tool. The material bank provides information on reusable materials based on the building information modeling. The design support tool generates efficient material procurement plans and provides information about the environmental and economic impact of the project. In a case study used to verify the framework, CO2 emissions were reduced by up to 77% through material reuse, which was consistent with the results of previous studies. However, owing to the cost of processing reusable materials, the overall cost was found to increase by up to about 40%. Therefore, an economic analysis over the entire life cycle when using reusable materials needs to be done. © 2020 by the authors.

A sustainable and prefabricated composite structural system was developed in this study wherein the steel beam is attached to the prefabricated steel-bars truss concrete slab using the demountable bolted connectors. Twelve push-out specimens were designed and tested to assess the shear behavior of the bolted connectors. The test results showed that the shear bearing capacity of the bolted connectors with the prefabricated steel-bars truss concrete slab increased 7.0% over that of the bolted connectors with the prefabricated normal concrete slab. Three full-scale composite beams with various shear connection ratios were constructed and loaded to failure. For direct comparison, a similar composite beam was constructed with the same section size and shear connectors, but using the cast-in-place concrete slab. The flexural capacity of the composite beams with 68% shear connection and full shear connection increased 9.8% and 15.8% compared to the composite beam with 46% shear connection, respectively. The mechanical behavior of the composite beam with the prefabricated concrete slab was comparable with that of the composite beam with cast-in-place concrete slab.

Demountability and reuse of structures contributes to the reduction of the environmental impact of the built environment. Welded headed studs used in traditional steel-concrete composite floor systems need to be replaced by demountable shear connectors to enable the transition of the construction sector to a circular business model. The demountable shear connectors are embedded in large prefabricated concrete floor elements and connected to steel beams by bolts. The holes in the beam flange are oversized to account for geometrical and dimensional deviations of all members and to facilitate rapid execution and easy demounting. The goal of this paper is to present a methodology that quantifies the required nominal hole clearance for reusable composite floor systems. Statistical characteristics of dimensional and geometrical deviations serve as input for Monte-Carlo simulations. The aggregated results of the Monte Carlo simulations are used to determine the required nominal hole clearance for a specified probability of successful installation of the demountable shear connectors. The proposed methodology is applied to the composite floor system of a demountable and reusable car park building. The contradicting requirement of oversized holes and composite interaction is solved by injecting the hole clearance with a (steel-reinforced) epoxy resin. The bearing resistance of the (steel-reinforced) epoxy resin is addressed based on preliminary results of creep experiments on resin-injected bolted connections. © 2020 Institution of Structural Engineers","Bearing strength; Composite floor system; Deviation; Resin-injected bolted connection; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078988463

The application of superelastic Shape Memory Alloy rebars at the plastic hinge region of reinforced concrete beam-column joints (SESMA-BCJs) can eliminate the seismic residual deformations. Such self-centering structures can maintain their reusability even after severe earthquakes. This research proposes a simple-yet practical-technique for more accurate modeling of SESMA-BCJs using VecTor2 software. Both material and geometric nonlinearity were considered. Efficiency and versatility of the modeling approach were verified against a number of test results at both material and structural levels. According to the results, the adopted modeling approach can be reliably used for the prediction of the cyclic response of hybrid SESMA-BCJs under changing various design parameters which are beyond the scope of the experimental tests. Furthermore, using the calibrated model, a comprehensive seismic parametric study was conducted to investigate the influence of various design parameters on the seismic performance of SESMA-BCJs. Finally, a new Fe-based SESMA-BCJ with a lower amount of SESMA and higher seismic performance than NiTi-based BCJs was introduced and numerically investigated. © 2019, Brazilian Association of Computational Mechanics.

Reuse of traditional composite beams is not possible due to the permanent connection between the steel beam and concrete deck established by welded headed studs. To allow for fast construction, demountability and reuse of composite beams, various demountable shear connectors can be used. In this paper the results of experiments carried out on demountable and reusable tapered composite beams, consisting of a tapered steel beam and large-scale prefabricated concrete decks, are presented. The performance of various arrangements of resin-injected bolt-coupler shear connectors was considered to optimize the beneficial effect of composite action whilst minimizing the number of shear connectors. An advantage of resin-injected bolted shear connectors is that composite action is obtained instantaneously and simultaneously for all connectors. Demountability and reusability of the composite beam were successfully demonstrated experimentally. Experimental and numerical results indicated that the number of shear connectors necessary to fulfil deflection and end-slip limits can be reduced by concentrating them near the supports of a simply-supported beam.

Traditionally, composite beams are cast in-situ and shear interaction between the concrete and steel beam is provided by welded headed studs. The application of welded headed studs prevents the non-destructive separation of the composite beam, which leads to a very low scoring in the sustainable assessment in terms of the reuse of structural components. An alternative to welded headed studs are bolted shear connectors, which allow for demountability and reusability of a (prefabricated) composite floor system. A key challenge for demountable and reusable composite beams consisting of prefabricated elements is to provide sufficient tolerances to allow for easy execution and demounting, but also to achieve a stiff and strong shear connection under live loads. The required tolerances can, for instance, be obtained by using large bolt-to-hole clearances. The, at first glance, contradictory requirement of a large hole clearance in the execution phase and high stiffness under live loading conditions was solved by using injection bolts. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the demountable and composite structures fit in the circular economy framework, and to show that such a demountable and reusable structure was successfully erected and demounted under laboratory conditions. In addition, a cost assessment will be addressed using a simple methodology based on estimated service life (ESL) factors to estimate the annual environmental costs of a composite floor system. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bolts; Composite beams and girders; Computer software reusability; Concretes; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Fits and tolerances; Floors; Reusability; Steel beams and girders; Studs (structural members); Tall buildings; Welding; Composite floor systems; Design of composites; Environmental costs; Laboratory conditions; Multi-storey car park; Prefabricated elements; Structural component; Sustainable assessment; Studs (fasteners)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063368363

Previous research has shown that, at room temperature, the mechanical performance of the U-shaped steel beams filled with DCLs and FC is similar to that of the U-shaped steel beams filled with FC alone. This research explores the fire behavior of the U-shaped steel beams filled with DCLs and FC. Five specimens including three beams filled with DCLs and FC and two reference beams filled with FC alone were tested in fire. The experimental parameters included the replacement ratio of DCLs, the longitudinal reinforcement ratio, the load ratio, and the thickness of fire insulation. Based on the test results, numerical models in which the thermal resistance at the interface between the U-shaped steel and the in-filled concrete is considered are developed using SAFIR to determine the thermal and structural responses of the specimens. Lastly, parametric studies are carried out preliminarily to investigate the effects of some parameters on the fire resistance of such beams. It is found that the replacement ratio of DCLs within a range of 0% to 33% has a very limited effect on the temperature distribution, structural response, and fire resistance of the specimens, that embedding longitudinal reinforcements can significantly increase the fire resistance of such beams, that the interface thermal resistance can generate a temperature drop of up to 280 °C at the interface between the U-shaped steel and the in-filled concrete, and that the numerical models are capable of predicting the thermal and structural responses of such beams. © 2018 by the authors.","Demolished concrete lumps; Fire test; Interface thermal resistance; Numerical models; Structural response; Thermal response; U-shaped steel beam",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051477578

Further optimization of composite beams is possible through use of tapered steel beams. In terms of material reuse, composite structures generally underperform, because of the concrete casted in-situ. The most common shear connector is the welded headed stud embedded in the concrete. An alternative to welded headed studs is a bolted shear connector, which allows for demountability of the composite floor system and subsequent reuse of it. The goal of this paper is to propose a method to determine the deflection of tapered composite beams with flexible shear connectors. Starting point is the theory available in literature for straight (i.e. prismatic) composite beams with flexible shear connectors. The proposed method is used in a case study to optimize the design of a composite beam in a multi-storey car park. Validation of the derived hand-calculation method is carried out through finite element analysis. An approximation is derived based on which the deflection of tapered composite beams can be estimated through hand calculation, with a deviation less than 5%.

Demountability of composite structures can be achieved by using bolted shear connectors embedded in the concrete. The goal of this paper is to show how such demountable shear connections can be implemented, which allows for easy execution and the reuse of all structural components. A key element in the suggested longitudinal shear device is injection bolts, used to fill the hole clearance with epoxy resin, increasing stiffness and ductility compared to traditional demountable composite structures.

However, because the headed stud shear connectors are welded onto the top flange of the steel beam and cast into the in situ concrete slab, deconstruction of the composite beam and the reuse of its components at the end of structural life in defence to demolition is virtually impossible, which is at odds with the increasing demands placed on improving the sustainability of building infrastructure. As an alternative, an innovative sustainable composite beam and slab system is proposed, in which precast geopolymer concrete panels are attached to the steel beams using high-strength friction-grip bolts instead of cast in situ floors with pre-welded headed stud connectors. The advantages of a low-carbon design, both by the use of geopolymer concrete elements and system deconstructability, can be achieved in this proposed system. In this paper, a three-dimensional finite element model is developed to investigate the structural behaviour of the proposed sustainable composite beam and slab system. Material non-linearities and the interaction of the structural components are included in the model. The accuracy and reliability of the finite element formulation developed are validated by comparisons with experimental results. Extensive parametric studies are conducted to elucidate the effects of the change in the concrete panel configuration, the number and diameter of the bolts, the type and strength of the concrete and the grade of the steel beam on the behaviour of the system.

Unknown bridge foundations pose a significant problem to the assessment of hydraulic and seismic vulnerability and post-hazard evaluation of bridges. In addition, bridge foundations reuse could become a viable option in the replacement of structurally deficient superstructures, potentially providing technical, economic, time and environmental benefits. Characterization and evaluation of existing bridge substructures has become an essential issue for the safety and serviceability of bridges. In recent years experimental modal analysis has become an effective tool for bridge condition assessment and system identification. However, many studies tend to emphasize dynamic testing and analysis of bridge superstructures with little consideration given to bridge substructure and their foundations. In this paper, a 3 non-continuous spans bridge with concrete deck and steel girders is used as a case study to investigate the possibility of characterization and condition evaluation of the substructure system leveraging dynamic testing methods. MIMO impact testing and operating modal analysis was operated on one of the piers of this bridge.

The endplate is made of high strength steels while the beam and the column are made of mild steels. This paper presents a numerical study conducted using ABAQUS on high strength steel endplate connections after cooling down from fire, to reveal more information and better understanding on the post-fire behaviour of high strength steel endplate connections. The validation of this numerical modelling against all representative experimental results was performed on moment-rotation relationship, failure mode and yield line pattern of endplate connections, where it is found that good agreements exist. Hence this numerical analysis method can be employed with reasonable accuracy to predict the behaviour of high strength steel endplate connections after cooling down from fire. This finite element analysis provides an efficient, economical, and accurate tool to investigate the post-fire performance of high strength steel endplate connections, which can be further developed for the parametric study and post-fire evaluation of an entire steel structure with high strength steel members.

A steel skeleton was constructed within the building for bracing before removing the existing floors, and the steel was repurposed in the final composite steel/concrete frame system.

Composite steel-concrete structural systems are very popular for medium-sized office buildings, but deconstruction and re-use in deference to demolition is difficult because headed stud shear connectors in the composite slab and steel beam flooring system cannot be detached easily, and reuse is virtually impossible. As an alternative, it is proposed that precast concrete panels can be attached to steel beams using pre-tensioned bolts, instead of cast-in-situ floors with pre-welded headed stud connectors. The proposed floor system can be deconstructed by unbolting the precast panels, enabling recyclability of the system and providing significant advantages in a paradigm within the construction industry focussed on low emissions. This paper presents an analysis of this slab and beam system, with the composite beams comprising of two elastic elements connected at their interface by a stiff but finite frictional connection. Under loading, it is shown that three distinct lengthwise domains exist along the member, and a model for this is presented and discussed. © 2014 WIT Press.","Composite beams; Deconstructability; Friction-grip bolting; Partial interaction; Precast","Composite beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Connectors (structural); Construction industry; Floors; Friction; Office buildings; Precast concrete; Steel beams and girders; Studs (fasteners); Composite beam; Deconstructability; Friction-grip bolting; Partial interaction; Pre-cast; Loading; composite; concrete structure; construction industry; demolition; floor; friction; loading; numerical model; office location; steel structure; structural component; structural response",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903171762

Steel beams are well suited to reuse, but are difficult to reuse when connected compositely to concrete slabs using welded studs. A demountable connection would allow composite performance but also permit reuse of both components at end-of-life. Three composite beams, of 2 m, 10 m and 5 m length, are constructed using M20 bolts as demountable shear connectors. The beams are tested in three-, six- and four-point bending, respectively. The former two are loaded to service, unloaded, demounted and reassembled; all three are tested to failure. The results show that all three have higher strengths than predicted using Eurocode 4. The longer specimens have performance similar to previously published comparable welded-connector composite beam results. This suggests that demountable composite beams can be safely used and practically reused, thus reducing carbon emissions. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Much of the environmental impact of buildings is associated with consumption of resources and generation of waste, therefore reducing waste in construction is becoming a top priority for all the European governments. Composite structures formed by connecting the concrete slabs to the supporting steel beams have been widely used for many years throughout the world, this cost-effective arrangement for floor system in multi-storey steel frame building structures is responsible for a considerable increase in the load-bearing capacity and stiffness of the steel beams, which has resulted in significant savings in steel weight and construction cost. However, shear connectors are welded through the steel decking and cast into the concrete; this made deconstruction and reuse of the steel components almost impossible. A demountable shear connector is developed to assess its potential and suitability in term of replacing the welded through headed shear studs. Test results shown that these shear connectors can be easily demounted both at working and ultimate load and have a similar capacity to the traditional welded shear connectors. In addition, the new demountable shear connectors process high ductility in comparison with the welded shear connectors and have similar behaviour to the traditional welded headed stud shear connectors. A fnite element is developed to carry out parametric study for this form of shear connector. © ASCE.",,"Composite materials; Concrete beams and girders; Concrete slabs; Construction; Construction industry; Cost effectiveness; Environmental impact; Steel beams and girders; Studs (fasteners); Studs (structural members); Welding; Construction costs; European governments; Headed stud shear connectors; Load-bearing capacity; Parametric study; Steel components; Steel concrete composite beam; Steel frame buildings; Vanadium steel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964577796

These parts are all prefabricated in the shop. When we reuse the structural members of the frame, all members must be taken apart easily. For this reason, beams are connected to beam-to-column connection by high-strength bolts and splicing plates, and columns are just set into the tube of beam-to-column connection. The gap between two tubes (CFT column and beam-to-column connection) is filled by high strength mortar. In order to clarify the elastic-plastic characteristics of this frame, he T-shape frame models consisting of CFT column and beam-to-column connection were tested under the constant axial load and cyclic horizontal load.",,"Composite beams and girders; Elasticity; Mortar; Plasticity; Structural analysis; Axial loads; Cyclic horizontal load; Steel beams; Steel structures",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645226320

In this paper, we present results of a life cycle inventory analysis of steel and steel-reinforced concrete bridge girders, based on publicly available data. We find that for the initial construction of equivalent designs for a particular location, a steel-reinforced concrete bridge generally has lower environmental effects than a steel bridge. The expected design life of the two types of bridges is influenced by wear and tear, but also by obsolescence. The uncertainty in bridge design life and related data uncertainties make comparisons based on annualized environmental effects difficult. The steel bridges' beneficial reuse and recycling rates may result in lower annualized environmental effects.
