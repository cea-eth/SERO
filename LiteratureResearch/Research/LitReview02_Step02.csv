The ontology can be useful to create a knowledge management system for different experts involved in the process of the building renovation, to extend the information and stretch the domain from the individual building to the environment. Knowledge about what entities and attributes to select is captured based on literature and investigating the pilot demonstration sites. Such an ontology can help to structure the surrounding data to support processes in different stages of the renovation. The final goal is to support planners in decision making process namely in site planning and pre-data collection phase, energy modeling, comfort analysis and so on to control cost and quality. Moreover, it can be valuable in further studies of integrating data of various sources for construction purposes.

This paper aims to develop a new information management method to cope with the risk problems involved in dealing with such data, based on domain ontologies of the construction industry, to help manage PPP risks, share and reuse risk knowledge. Design/methodology/approach: Risk knowledge concepts are acquired and summarized through PPP failure cases and an extensive literature review to establish a domain framework for risk knowledge using ontology technology to help manage PPP risks. Findings: The results indicate that the risk ontology is capable of capturing key concepts and relationships involved in managing PPP risks and can be used to facilitate knowledge reuse and storage beneficial to risk management. Research limitations/implications: The classes in the risk knowledge ontology model constructed in this research do not yet cover all the information in PPP project risks and need to be further extended. Moreover, only the framework and basic methods needed are developed, while the construction of a working ontology model and the relationship between implicit and explicit knowledge is a complicated process that requires repeated modifications and evaluations before it can be implemented. Practical implications: The ontology provides a basis for turning PPP risk information into risk knowledge to allow the effective sharing and communication of project risks between different project stakeholders. It can also have the potential to help reduce the dependence on subjectivity by mining, using and storing tacit knowledge in the risk management process. Originality/value: The apparent suitability of the nine classes of PPP risk knowledge (project model, risk type, risk occurrence stage, risk source, risk consequence, risk likelihood, risk carrier, risk management measures and risk case) is identified, and the proposed construction method and steps for a complete domain ontology for PPP risk management are unique. A combination of criteria- and task-based evaluations is also developed for assessing the PPP risk ontology for the first time. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Domain ontology; Project management; Public–private partnership; Risk knowledge; Risk management; Rule-based reasoning,Construction industry; Digital storage; Information management; Ontology; Project management; Risk assessment; Construction projects; Domain ontologies; Ontology model; Ontology-based; Project risk; Public/private partnerships; Risk knowledge; Risk ontologies; Risks management; Rule-based reasoning; Risk management,Article,,,,,,

Scientometric analysis (e.g. co-author, co-word, co-citation, and clusters) objectively visualized the research status quo while a critical review was used to identify the research themes and challenges of ontology research in the construction industry. The results identified a large network of co-authors in this field to understand collaboration relationships. Over half the papers (53%) were published by the following three countries: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The top co-occurring keywords were “project management” at which ontology facilitates knowledge management and information retrieval. When the time factor was taken into consideration, keywords naturally evolved from “project management” and “knowledge management” to “building information modeling” and “compliance control” with the successful adoption of information techniques in the construction industry. Four research themes were identified with the combination of cluster analysis and critical review: “Domain ontology” “Industry foundation classes” “Automated compliance checking” and “Building information modeling”.

The innovations in digital technologies in Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) sector are not just related to the enhancement of consolidated processes, but they open new collaboration methods and integration with other Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) such as Internet of Things (IoT), additive manufacturing, automation, augmented reality and artificial intelligence. As domain-specific software solutions are expanding their features over different sources and datasets, the need for integration and standardization of information storage and exchange arises. Semantic Web technologies are one of the emerging solutions for solving such issues, as they offer the possibility to combine data from diverse data models and multiple domains using the web. Among the ontologies developed in the last decade for the construction sector, one specific reference should be made on the ifcOWL, an IFC-based ontology representing the most used data schema industry. Nonetheless, from the standardization point of view, so far ontologies have not been considered among the standard methods for information exchange in the AEC, unlike in other sectors (e.g. ISO 15926 was firstly developed for the integration of life cycle data for process plants of oil and gas facilities).

Today, with the development of the IFC project model by the IAI, the product modelling paradigm is being rapidly introduced in commercial software as well. However, actual PDT application in the AEC domain is still limited to CAD data exchange and some basic project-centred data management facilities. There is a great need of human-centred product model services supporting the engineer with additional knowledge about the models, providing customisable user-friendly capabilities for management and modification of the data, and enabling structured access to the information on the project(s) he is working on. These issues have motivated the development of an ontology framework that can serve as advanced user gateway to product model data. The suggested approach draws upon recent ICT achievements, especially regarding IFC environments. In this paper we present the rationale, the principal design, and the technical structure of the ontology framework based on the XML schema specification.

Such a framework can also improve the successful accomplishment of building projects. This paper aims to use Semantic Web technologies for facilitating information exchange within existing building projects. Design/methodology/approach: In real-world building projects, the construction industry’s information supply chain may initiate from near scratch when new building projects are started resulting in diverse data structures represented in unstructured data sources, like Excel spreadsheets and documents. Large-scale data generated throughout a building's life-cycle requires exchanging and processing during an asset's Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase. Building information modelling (BIM) processes and related technologies can address some of the challenges and limitations of information exchange and interoperability within new building projects. However, the use of BIM in existing and retrofit assets has been hampered by the challenges surrounding the limitations of existing technologies. Findings: The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it briefly outlines the framework previously developed for generating semantically enriched 3D retrofit models. Secondly, a framework is proposed focussing on facilitating the information exchange and interoperability for existing buildings. Semantic Web technologies and standards, such as Web Ontology Language and existing AEC domain ontologies are used to enhance and improve the proposed framework. Originality/value: The proposed framework is evaluated by implementing an example application and the Resource Description Framework data produced by the previously developed framework. The proposed approach makes a valuable contribution to the asset/facilities management (AM/FM) domain. It should be of interest to various FM practices for existing assets, such as the building information/knowledge management for design, construction and O&M stages of an asset’s life-cycle. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Building Information Modelling (BIM); Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Information exchange and interoperability; Point Cloud Data (PCD); Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantic Web technologies; Web Ontology Language (OWL),Construction; Construction industry; Information dissemination; Interoperability; Life cycle; Ontology; Retrofitting; Semantic Web; Spreadsheets; Structural design; Supply chains; Building Information Modelling; Design/methodology/approach; Information exchange framework; Information supply chain; Operation and maintenance; Resource description framework; Semantic Web ontologies; Semantic Web technology; Architectural design,Article,,,,,,

It suggests building material passports as a data source for the materials to be circulated and then integrates them by means of Linked Data.A common language is proposed to combine and re-use the material data in the CE with the creation of two ontologies: Circular Exchange Ontology (CEO) and the Circular Materials and Activities Ontology (CAMO). The ontologies annotate materials under a CE classification scheme and describe the elements required for material exchange to occur: actors, the activities they perform and the referents of these activities (resources, products, tools and waste).An evaluation of the ontologies is made by means of use case-driven SPARQL queries. Further, a wide-scale evaluation addresses how a decentralized data ecosystem can enable users to publish information and dynamically interact with different repositories to exchange materials. Results indicate that these ontologies can foster a circulation medium between diverse construction industry resources.

We do this by focusing on the concept of Circular Economy. Circular Economy is often presented as a solution to the problems of a globalized economy in the form of over-exploitation of resources, climate change and pollution of the environment. Within the mainstream economics paradigm, the aim is how to increase the effectiveness of resource extraction and utilization in order to maintain growth. We contrast this with the paradigm of Ecological Economics where the goal of the economy is to achieve and secure a higher quality of life. Circular Economy often side steps the deep ontological and epistemological questions we need to answer if we are to address the complex and interrelated environmental, economic and social problems we face today. This can be a limiting factor in the search for creative and long-term solutions. However, within the Circular Economy discourse, we find strands that critically engage with the foundations of mainstream Economics and so, innovative solutions for the society of the future are a possibility.

Such systems support more effective collaboration, where virtual teams of skilled users, not software, exchange ideas, decisions, and best practice. To achieve that, there is a need to create consistent semantic representation of construction knowledge. Existing representations, in the form of classification systems and product data models, lack effective modeling of concept semantics - a fundamental requirement for human-based exchange of knowledge. Toward this objective, this paper presents a domain taxonomy that was developed as part of the e-COGNOS project. The taxonomy was developed as a first step in the establishment of domain ontology for construction. The taxonomy was developed to be process-centered and to allow for utilization of already existing classification systems (BS6100, Master Format, and UniClass, for example). The taxonomy uses seven major domains to classify construction concepts: Process, Product, Project, Actor, Resource, Technical Topics, and Systems. The taxonomy was developed and validated through extensive interaction with domain experts. The taxonomy was used to develop a prototype ontology for the construction domain including semantic relationships and axioms. The ontology was used to support several applications in semantic knowledge management as part of the e-COGNOS portal, including semantic indexing and retrieval of information and ontology-based collaborative project development. © ASCE.",Construction industry; Information management; Internet; Knowledge-based systems,Computer supported cooperative work; Construction industry; Decision making; Indexing (of information); Information management; Internet; Mathematical models; Semantics; Software prototyping; World Wide Web; Domain taxonomy; Ontology; Semantic indexing; Semantic web; Knowledge based systems,Review,,,,,,

These goals tend to be overlapped with the purposes of the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC), which is a standard for the construction industry defined through an EXPRESS schema. A connecting point between semantic web technologies and the IFC standard would be represented by an agreed Web Ontology Language (OWL) ontology for IFC (termed ifcOWL) that allows to (1) keep on using the well-established IFC standard for representing construction data, (2) exploit the enablers of semantic web technologies in terms of data distribution, extensibility of the data model, querying, and reasoning, and (3) re-use general purpose software implementations for data storage, consistency checking and knowledge inference.

Knowledge management has been hailed as an enabler for tapping this knowledge to improve efficiency in the AEC industry. In this study, the main concepts and benefits of knowledge management, relationships between knowledge management and continuous improvement have been examined. Furthermore, emphasis has been laid on knowledge management through experience feedback processes which constitute valuable assets for the AEC industry. This is done through the employment of ontologies and graph-based reasoning operations in eliciting and visualizing knowledge concepts in the AEC domain. The proposed approach which consists of two main aspects provides the opportunity to examine the conceptual and ontological knowledge models with associated reasoning. In the first, the concepts of knowledge management, their significance and application in the AEC field are discussed. The second deals with a methodological framework for the modeling and reasoning in the domain ontology. To facilitate automation, an ontology graph-based editor, Conceptual Graphs User Interface (CoGui) was used to model knowledge and encoded reasoning in the knowledge base. CoGui encodes knowledge as conceptual graphs and reasoning as graph operations that can be visualized in a logically precise way, based on domain ontologies. It emerged that CoGui could be very useful in acquiring information that can be used in collaboration with others to continuously improve information sharing and re-use.

Collaboration is the arena, engineering projects are the target, knowledge is the currency used to provide harmony into the arena since it can potentially support innovation and, hence, a successful collaboration. The building and construction domain is challenged with significant problems for exchanging, sharing and integrating information between actors. For example, semantic gaps or lack of meaning definition at the conceptual and technical level, are problems fundamentally created through the employment of representations to map the ‘world’ into models in an endeavour to anticipate different actors’ views, vocabulary, and objectives. One of the primary research challenges addressed in this work is the process of formalization and representation of document content, where most existing approaches are limited in their capability and only take into account the explicit, word-based information in the document. The research described in this paper explores how traditional knowledge representations can be enriched by incorporation of implicit information derived from the complex relationships (the Semantic Associations) modelled by domain ontologies combined with the information presented in documents, thereby providing a baseline for facilitating knowledge interpretation and sharing between humans and machines. The paper introduces a novel conceptual framework for representation of knowledge sources, where each knowledge source is semantically represented (within its domain of use) by a Semantic Vector. This work contributes to the enrichment of Semantic Vectors, using the classical vector space model approach extended with ontological support, employing ontology concepts and their relations in the enrichment process. The test bed for the assessment of the approach is the Building and Construction industry, using an appropriateB&CdomainOntology. Preliminary results were collected using a clustering algorithm for document classification, which indicates that the proposed approach does improve the precision and recall of classifications.

This involves the formal semantics of these languages which is typically based on a limited set of abstract mathematical notions. In this paper, we discuss the interplay between formal semantics and the intended role of ontologies as semantic foundation. In this connection a circularity is identified if ontologies are to determine the conceptual equivalence of expressions. This is particularly relevant for ontologies which are to be provided in multiple formalisms. In order to overcome this situation, ontological semantics is generally defined as a novel kind of semantics which is purely and directly based on ontological entities. We sketch a specific application of this semantics to the syntax of first order logic. In order to beneficially rely on theoretical results and reasoning systems, an approximation of the proposed semantics in terms of the conventional approach is established. This results in a formalization method for first order logic and a translation-based variant of ontological semantics. Both variants involve an ontology for their application. In the context of developing a top-level ontology, we outline an ontology which serves as a meta-ontology in applying ontological semantics to the formalization of ontologies. Finally, resolved and remaining issues as well as related approaches are briefly discussed. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

We discuss several approaches of lifting modeling information that is based on the express family of languages for data modeling onto a logically rigid and semantically enhanced ontological level encoded in the W3C Ontology Web Language. We exemplify the added value of such formal notation of building models by providing several examples where generic query and reasoning algorithms can be applied to problems that otherwise have to be manually hard-wired into applications for processing building information. Furthermore, we show how the underlying resource description framework and the set of technologies evolving around it can be tailored to the need of distributed collaborative work in the building and construction industry.

Architecture, engineering, and construction industry spends time and money to solve the information sharing and interoperability issues between different domains. With the advent of building information modeling, a 3D CAD model of a project is used as a shared knowledge resource during the design, construction, and facility management phases of a project's life cycle. Currently, 4D models are created by combining CAD and schedule information. A 4D model is useful for detecting potential construction conflicts during the project planning and design and a valuable tool during construction. However, creating 4D models requires a great amount of human involvement. An approach that facilitates integrating BIM and schedule information can improve efficiency and is highly desirable. This paper presents a new approach to information modeling using the Semantic Web technology. The Semantic Web provides an infrastructure and a data modeling format that allows computers to access and combine information distributed over the Internet. The paper discusses: (1) ontologies that the authors have developed for BIM and project schedule information; (2) how ontologies are used for creating project knowledge bases in RDF/OWL format; and (3) how project knowledge bases can facilitate machine processing of project information and semantic interoperability among project knowledge bases. The Semantic Web approach allows information to be saved once at the provider source and be used by authorized users as needed. This means BIM information is created and maintained by designers and project schedule is created and maintained by schedulers on their respective servers. This would allow the latest BIM and project schedule information to be accessed over the Internet and combined for various purposes. © ASCE.",,"Architectural design; Budget control; Computer aided design; Construction industry; Information analysis; Information management; Information theory; Information use; Internet; Interoperability; Life cycle; Office buildings; Semantic Web; Architecture , engineering , and constructions; Building Information Model - BIM; Construction projects; Information Modeling; Project informations; Semantic interoperability; Semantic web approach; Semantic Web technology; Project management",Conference Paper,,,,,,

This study performs knowledge discovery of construction products from domain experts to build an ontology. However, ontology developed becomes an isolated conceptualization. In order to get rich domain ontology, novel approach is to retrieve knowledge from domain-specific online product repositories such as the industry foundation classes. This study identifies similarities between the industry foundation classes and ontology likewise their differences with the hope that it would develop an enhanced knowledge conceptualization of the domain. Integration of IFC and ontology will mean that concepts represent well-established standard terms rich in domain knowledge. Other semantic web technologies can then be exploited on the resulting application to perform data querying, consistency checking, data reasoning, knowledge inference and so much more. Thus, the resulting ontology could be standardized and be easily applied for use in practice in the industry. © 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",Industry Foundation Classes (IFC); Ontology; Photovoltaic Systems (PV); Semantic Web (SW); Web Ontology Language (OWL),"Construction industry; Foundations; Photovoltaic cells; Process engineering; Semantic Web; Architectural , engineering and constructions; Building Information Modelling; Construction products; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Knowledge conceptualization; Photovoltaic systems; Semantic Web technology; Web ontology language; Ontology",Conference Paper,,,,,,

The enmeshment of the Web and various business processes has made it imperative to define business information in a format that facilitates machine-to-machine exchange and automated processing. The construction industry is not an exception; construction business processes depend on a diverse set of information sources. For efficient processing of the construction business information, it is necessary to publish the information in a format that allows computer applications to easily discover, query and share the information. Currently, the standard for representing, accessing, and sharing a building model is the Industry Foundation Classes (IFCs) data model. Several researchers have investigated the limitations of IFCs data model for interoperability among heterogeneous software applications. This paper presents the results of an on-going research on an ontology-based approach to building information modeling to facilitate information exchange among different knowledge domain applications. The approach developed in this study is based on a shared building ontology that models building domain element types and element relationships. The information systems to be integrated should be modeled using the shared ontology; each knowledge domain adds its own element properties to the shared building ontology. SWRL rules are used for mapping element properties from one domain to another. An example demonstrates how the developed approach can facilitate project information sharing between design and estimating domains. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Application programs; Architectural design; Construction industry; Information systems; Information theory; Knowledge management; Ontology; Query processing; Building Information Model - BIM; Business information; Construction business; Distributed information; Heterogeneous software applications; Industry Foundation Classes - IFC; Information exchanges; Project informations; Information dissemination,Conference Paper,,,,,,

Knowledge is used as an important resource in many industrial areas, and so it follows that there is a growing interest in knowledge management within the construction industry. Yet because of the unique characteristics of construction knowledge created during projects, there are limitations to its capture and reuse. The knowledge produced during construction projects is project-oriented, experiential, and context specific; due to these characteristics, the reuse of knowledge is difficult. In this research, research team focus on capturing and identifying the characteristics of construction knowledge, then propose a method for applying these characteristics to the development of an ontology-based construction knowledge retrieval system. Moreover, research team developed a system prototype that applies ontology in suggesting related search words during the search process and validated the effectiveness of the prototype in terms of precision and recall rate.

Many architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) organisations have invested heavily in information technology and KM systems that help in this regard. While these have been largely successful in supporting intra-organisational business processes, interoperability problems still persist at the project organisation level due to the heterogeneity of the systems used by the different organisations involved. Ontologies are seen as an important means of addressing these problems. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of ontologies in the construction project delivery process, particularly with respect to information and KM. A detailed technical review of the fundamental concepts and related work has been undertaken, with examples and case studies of ontology-based information and KM presented to illustrate the key concepts. The specific issues and technical difficulties in the design and construction context are highlighted, and the approaches adopted in two ontology-based applications for the AEC sector are presented. The paper concludes that there is considerable merit in ontology-based approaches to information and KM, but that significant technical challenges remain. Middleware applications, such as semantic web-based information management system, are contributing in this regard but more needs to be done particularly on integrating or merging ontologies. The value of the paper lies in the detailed exploration of ontology-based information and KM within a design and construction context, and the use of appropriate examples and applications to illustrate the key issues. © 2008, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Construction industry; Data structures; Generation and dissemination of information; Knowledge management; Semantics,,Article,,,,,,

With more information being added to the model, the size of the model file and the difficulty to manipulate the model increase. However, different use scenarios may only require access to certain specific information stored in the model. In contrast with the ample research of ontology applications in construction knowledge management, research of ontology in construction modeling has been limited. Hence, the purpose of this study is to use ontology in the extraction of a partial building information model from the original complete model. The building information models covered in this study are in the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) format, which is a widely supported open BIM standard. An ontology TBox is developed according to the existing IFC schema specifications. For each specific IFC model, an ontology ABox is generated at run time, combining the ontology TBox and the IFC instances in the model. The ABox works as an index in the partial model extraction algorithm. A prototype Java program based on the algorithm was developed to demonstrate and validate the algorithm using both a sample model and an IFC model from a real building.

Properly managing, exchanging and exploiting these data is an ever ongoing challenge in this domain. This has resulted in large semantic RDF graphs that are to be combined with a significant number of other data sets (building product catalogues, regulation data, geometric point cloud data, simulation data, sensor data), thus making an already huge dataset even larger. Making these big data available at high performance rates and speeds and into the correct (intuitive) formats is therefore an incredibly high challenge in this domain. Yet, hardly any benchmark is available for this industry that (1) gives an overview of the kind of data typically handled in this domain; and (2) that lists the query and reasoning performance results in handling these data. In this article, we therefore present a set of available sample data that explicates the scale of the situation, and we additionally perform a query and reasoning performance benchmark. This results not only in an initial set of quantitative performance results, but also in recommendations in implementing a web-based system relying heavily on large semantic data. As such, we propose an initial benchmark through which new upcoming data management proposals in the architectural design and construction domains can be measured. © 2016 ACM.",Benchmark; Big data; Building information modeling; Built environment; IFC; OWL; Reasoning; Semantic web,Architectural design; Benchmarking; Data handling; Information management; Semantic Web; Building Information Model - BIM; Building products; Built environment; Design and construction; Large scale buildings; Point cloud data; Reasoning; Reasoning performance; Big data,Conference Paper,,,,,,

However, this interest remains largely academic and has not sparked much adoption of web technologies in the field. To nourish adoption of Linked Data in practice, access to the data has to be made more easy. SPARQL, the recommended RDF query language, has proven very powerful for retrieving and updating RDF datasets. However, due to its verbosity and complexity, it is often considered a threshold for developers to implement in their tools. In this paper, we compare SPARQL with Linked Data querying languages that extend the GraphQL syntax, in context of querying building datasets: HyperGraphQL and GraphQL-LD. Since it went open source in 2015, GraphQL has been adopted by a large community of developers, partly due to its elegance and conciseness. As a use case, the queries are performed on an RDF-based multi-model that relies on the recent ISO standard ICDD (ISO 21597). ICDD interlinks information on a sub-document identifier level, based on OWL. It is aimed at the industry in that it adds a layer of Linked Data to documentation formats that are still widely used in practice: IFC, spreadsheets, imagery etc. Therefore, it is considered a tuned use case for comparing these different RDF query languages. © 2019 CEUR-WS.

This paper addresses this challenge by associating the entities through affinity semantic (to what degree they are related in their application context). Through the analysis of a motivating example in building construction industry, this paper formally defines semantic association based on multiple-perspective domain standards.

Therefore, this paper presents the Renovation-Installation (Reno-Inst) ontology, which maps knowledge from the renovation domain considering different requirements, constraints, and other elements related to the installation of common renovation products such as windows, thermal insulation panels, and heat radiators. The development of the Reno-Inst ontology relies on an approach combining input from experts and knowledge from related engineering documents. The verification and validation process includes a content evaluation workshop with experts, a verification design stage, and the analysis and implementation of a real case study. The paper provides another example of the power of ontologies as a method for mapping and representing knowledge, gathering, and retrieving relevant information. Particularly, renovation projects encounter diverse challenges that lead to cost and schedule overruns, making their performance typically low.

To reach this goal, it is necessary to use open standards for model exchange such as the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). The non-profit organization buildingSMART defines this standard. IFC provides object types and attributes, which describe properties of objects. The IFC standard do not address possible values for attributes; but beside coordinated names for object types and attributes, coordinated values for attributes are required. This is necessary for the evaluation of digital models for different purposes. Several approaches in the fields of ontology and classification systems address this issue. However, at present time there is no clear distinction between prerequisites that modeled objects have to fulfill and products, which satisfy these requirements. Suppliers or construction companies at the interface between planning and construction propose products for the modelled requirements of the planning process. This paper describes an approach that bases on a dictionary, which provides standardized object types, attributes and values. A project database and a database with products, called supplier database, use this dictionary as a basis. Resulting from the modeling phase, the project database is ultimately mapped with the supplier database to propose products that fulfill the requirements.

As a result, one physical object yields several disciplinary representations, allowing designers to describe design options discipline-specifically and thus explore design differently. In a co-design approach, data from disciplines must be integrated and interoperable. But in current practice, interoperability problems between different software often hinders data integration. This paper presents a review and evaluation of interoperability paradigms in centralized, decentralized, and federated data, and it gives AEC application examples for each approach. It discusses data schemas (e.g. IFC) and interoperability tools (e.g. Speckle, BHoM). It also relates the interoperability tools to semantic web standards that are used to share information. It argues the advantages of federated data interoperability and suggests using design tools that employ such a mechanism. Furthermore, this paper suggests developing modular disciplinary ontologies to support collaborative design tools. Such federated interoperability, supported by modular disciplinary ontologies, can provide a solid ground to share and exchange data flexibly. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",alignment; Building Information Modelling (BIM); Co-Design; Data mapping; Interoperability; Knowledge representation; Ontologies,Architectural design; Construction industry; Data integration; Interoperability; Ontology; AEC industry; Building industry; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Co-designs; Data interoperability; Data mappings; Knowledge-representation; Modulars; Ontology's; Knowledge representation,Conference Paper,,,,,,

Regardless of what or where, buildings and infrastructures are subject to planning and building control, health and safety provision, environmental regulation and much more. Governments publish their rules (laws and regulations) to which Construction products must comply. E-government strategies have been deployed around the world aiming to simplify the application of those rules to control and inspect building projects, but this is not enough. There is still something missing regarding the enforcement and application of such rules on the edge of the e-world. This paper proposes a preliminary insight into innovative work aiming to deliver a sound solution to help the Construction sector to find its place in the even more regulated world. This work is pursued as part of a PhD thesis which has just started. It introduces a formal ontological approach of conformity models for regulations represented through OWL-based ontologies and a set of RuML Rules. The rationale behind the work, its current status, challenges foreseen in the near future are also included in the paper. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group.",,Buildings; Construction industry; Environmental regulations; Government data processing; Knowledge based systems; Ontology; Building controls; Building projects; Construction activities; Construction products; Construction sectors; Current status; E governments; Health and safeties; Ontological approaches; Phd thesis; Project executions; Rules and regulations; Laws and legislation,Conference Paper,,,,,,

The UK government has long recognised this and is taking the lead towards a more sustainable approach to construction processes. Success towards a more sustainable construction can be achieved if the stakeholders are informed of the new technologies, innovations and knowledge emerging in the sector. Unfortunately, researchers and practitioners have pin-pointed some limitations with the current approaches in the management of knowledge within the construction sector. Interestingly, Semantic Web technologies, the next generation of the Web technologies, can be used to overcome these limitations. Semantic web technologies can considerably improve information representation, sharing and re-use. This paper investigates the extent to which Semantic Web technologies could be used in representing knowledge on emerging sustainable building technologies. This is done by reviewing the current state-of-the art of sustainable technologies in the UK construction industry. Furthermore, it examines the development of an ontology-driven knowledge base and its usage in the development of a semantic web application.",Ontology-driven knowledge base; Semantic web technology; Sustainability development,Construction process; Construction sectors; Information representation; Knowledge base; Quality of life; Semantic web applications; Semantic Web technology; State of the art; Sustainable building; Sustainable construction; Sustainable technology; UK construction industry; Web technologies; Construction industry; Intelligent buildings; Knowledge based systems; Project management; Research; Sustainable development; Technology,Conference Paper,,,,,,

In a significantly large project, where the construction site extends to thousands of hectares and many construction companies, each with different software, are involved, different data models, various standards, the coordination and effective exchange of information can lead to difficulties in quick process configuration. Therefore, a higher-level structure, which would encapsulate the heterogeneity of the distributed environment by providing of common-shared ontological definitions, plays an important role. So the ontology-based approach benefits in consideration of the existing problems. The configuration flexibility is supported by the rule-based applications. In addition, intelligent solutions can be obtained by applying of different building strategies that can optimize the process flow. The processes, ontologies and rules can be presented as different types of knowledge enabling as a combination of an efficient knowledge-based process configuration.",,Construction industry; Intelligent computing; Ontology; Configuration flexibility; Construction companies; Distributed environments; Essential characteristic; Exchange of information; Intelligent solutions; Knowledge-based process; Process configuration; Knowledge based systems,Conference Paper,,,,,,

In comparison to green-field construction projects, adaptive reuse projects require distinct stages, definition of interfaces, decision gates, and planning methods in order to secure the success of the building project. Unfortunately, little research has been done regarding establishing feasible systems for the planning, assessment, and management of adaptive reuse projects, leading to underperforming building projects outcomes. Interface management (IM) can improve renovation projects outcomes by defining appropriate ways to identify, record, monitor, and track project interfaces. IM has the potential of bringing cost and time benefits during adaptive reuse projects execution. The aim of this study is to develop a reference framework for implementing IM for adaptive reuse projects. First, the inefficiencies of redevelopment projects are explained inside of a circular economy (CE) context. Second, an ontology of IM for adaptive reuse projects is defined based on the current barriers to adaptive reuse and the most common interface problems in construction projects. Third, the defined ontology is expanded through a case study by showing examples of adaptive reuse barriers on a case project, and how IM could have been part of the solution for these problems. Finally, this study concludes with the suggestions on interface management systems (IMS) implementation for future adaptive reuse projects. © 2019 by the authors.",Adaptive reuse of buildings; Barriers in adaptive reuse projects; Circular economy; Interface management system; Interface problems in construction projects,,Article,,,,,,

Even though some technological innovations around Building Information Modeling (BIM) might have the potential to overcome these challenges, data integration across disciplines, companies and software solutions is yet to be solved entirely. Trending advancements try to enrich existing BIM data using Linked Data technologies to semantically describe the building information and facilitate data integration. By that, project data from different data sources is made available in an accessible format, so project participants can use it for their planning efforts. In this paper we explore the use of Linked Building Data (LBD) on a specific use case to answer the question of how the planning of Temporary Construction Items (TCIs) can be improved by integrating data and automating the demand calculation. A literature review concludes that TCIs only experience little attention in the current planning of construction projects but have a critical impact on the outcome of a project. Thus, the objective of this paper is to develop standard ontologies to provide a semantically rich terminology of the data and to propose a framework for TCI consideration within a BIM based project delivery system. A prototype solution is developed, taking formwork as a TCI representative. The result is a process for automatically creating a TCI utilization plan that quantifies the precise time- and location-based on-site TCI demand by integrating data from BIM, Location-Based Scheduling (LBS) and TCI information. Based on the results of prototyping and findings from expert interviews, this research integrates the solution into the process of construction and finally proposes two implementation scenarios for the solution – one being based on the current industry situation and one exploring the future vision of a more integrated and decentralized project delivery in the construction industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",BIM; Linked Building Data; Temporary construction items,Architectural design; Construction; Construction industry; 'current; Building Information Modelling; Linked building data; Location based; Project complexity; Project environment; Software solution; Technological innovation; Temporary construction; Temporary construction item; Data integration,Review,,,,,,

Web of Data technologies - Semantic Web/Linked Data - can be used to interlink distributed building-related data with connections to activities, social networks, and business operations in buildings. IFC and Web of Data can have complementary roles in cross-model linking.
