# FoIP - Formalization of Inventory Processes

The transition to a circular economy and the closure of material loops in the construction sector require careful consideration of material stocks. However, there is a lack of consensus on the specific information needed to assess the reusability of building elements, specifically steel beams. This thesis aims to address this issue within the European and Swiss context. Additionally, digital technologies are recognized as critical enablers of the circular economy, and any consensus reached should be translated into digital formats. Therefore, the thesis also focuses on developing a digital ontology for reusing building elements, specifically steel beams. The research questions are: (1) What information is required to assess the reusability of steel beams in building audits? (2) What should an ontology for building audits to determine steel beam reusability look like? By formalizing and transforming expert knowledge into a readable format for both humans and machines, this thesis aims to facilitate the application of circular economy principles in the construction industry. The research methodology includes literature reviews, surveys, and interviews with reuse experts. The findings contribute to the development of an ontology, the SERO (Steel Element Reuse Ontology), which provides definitions and a logical framework for assessing the reuse potential of steel beams.

# <a name="Literature_Research"></a>Literature Research

A semi-structured literature research was conducted to investigate the research field. Two distinct research approaches were established to locate relevant literature pertaining to each of the research questions.

The literature proposed on Scopus and Web of Science was exported as csv-file. It was then merged, sorted, dublicates were deleted (Step01) and finally sorted again by title (Step02) and abstract (Step03).

The code to sort the literature was inspired by the work of Kira Kulik.
